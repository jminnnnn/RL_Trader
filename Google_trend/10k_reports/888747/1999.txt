ITEM 1.   BUSINESS


General

     Tommy Hilfiger Corporation ("THC" or the "Company"; unless the context
indicates otherwise, all references to the "Company" include THC and its
subsidiaries), through its subsidiaries, designs, sources and markets men's and
women's sportswear, jeanswear and childrenswear under the Tommy Hilfiger
trademarks.  See "Acquisition of Womenswear, Jeanswear and Canadian Licensees."
Through a range of strategic licensing agreements, the Company is expanding its
product lines to offer a broader array of apparel, accessories, footwear,
fragrance and home furnishings.  The Company's products can be found in leading
department and specialty stores throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico,
Central and South America, Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and other countries in the
Far East. Tommy Hilfiger is the Company's principal designer and provides
leadership and direction for all aspects of the design process.  The Company's
apparel is designed to combine classic American styling with unique details and
fit to give time-honored basics a fresh and updated look for customers who
desire high quality, designer clothes at competitive prices.  The Company was
organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands in June 1992.

     The Company's principal growth strategy has been to expand its in-store
shop program, whereby participating retailers set aside floor space highlighted
by distinctive fixtures dedicated for the exclusive sale of the Company's
products by the retailer.  The Company expects to continue to pursue this
strategy by increasing the number and size of its in-store shops and fixtured
areas in the United States and internationally.

     In addition to continuing to expand the in-store shop and fixtured areas
program, the Company plans to grow by broadening its range of product offerings,
both in-house and through licensing arrangements, and by expanding its channels
of distribution.  Through the expansion of its product lines, the Company
believes it will serve a wider variety of customer needs.  Since 1992, the
Company has introduced several in-house products, including childrenswear,
athleticwear and jeanswear.  Additionally, the Company has introduced new
products through licensing agreements, including fragrances, robes and
sleepwear, footwear, home furnishings and other accessories.  See "Merchandising
Strategies - Licensing and Distributorships."

     As of March 31, 1999, the Company operated 73 outlet stores and five
specialty retail stores, including a store in London, England and currently
plans to open approximately 8 to 10 additional outlet stores by March 31, 2000.
The Company also operates two flagship stores, one in Beverly Hills, California
opened in November 1997 and one in London, England opened in March 1999.  See
"Merchandising Strategies - Retailing."

     As of March 31, 1999, the Company was engaged in principally three
reportable segments:  Wholesale, Retail and Licensing.  The Wholesale segment
consists of the design and sourcing of men's sportswear and jeanswear, women's
casualwear and jeanswear and childrenswear for wholesale distribution.  The
Retail segment reflects the operations of the Company's outlet, specialty and
flagship stores.  The Licensing segment consists of the operations of licensing
the Company's trademarks for specified products in specified geographic areas.

                                       3

Share Split

     On June 4, 1999, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had
approved and declared a two-for-one split of the Company's Ordinary Shares, par
value $.01 per share (the "Ordinary Shares").  The split will be effected in the
form of a dividend of one Ordinary Share per Ordinary Share issued and
outstanding or held by the Company in its treasury (the "Share Split"), and will
be payable on July 9, 1999 to shareholders of record at the close of business on
June 18, 1999.  In connection with the Share Split, the Board of Directors of
the Company also approved an increase in the number of authorized Ordinary
Shares to 150,000,000 from 75,000,000.

     The share and per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not
reflect the effect of the Share Split.  The pro forma effect of the Share Split
is disclosed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.


Acquisition of Womenswear, Jeanswear and Canadian Licensees

     On May 8, 1998, following the approval by the shareholders of the Company
on May 5, 1998, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, acquired
Pepe Jeans USA, Inc., the Company's United States womenswear and jeanswear
licensee ("Pepe USA"), TJ Far East Limited, Pepe USA's buying agency affiliate
("Pepe Far East"), and Tomcan Investments Inc. ("Tomcan"), the parent
corporation of Tommy Hilfiger Canada Inc. ("TH Canada"), the Company's Canadian
licensee (collectively, the "Acquired Companies"), for an aggregate purchase
price of $755,760,000 in cash plus 9,045,930 Ordinary Shares of the Company (the
"Acquisition").  The cash portion of the purchase price was funded through a
combination of cash on hand, the issuance of debt securities in a public
offering and bank borrowings.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources"
in Item 7.

     Pursuant to a license granted by the Company, Pepe USA had exclusive United
States rights to develop, source and market men's, women's and girls' jeanswear
and jeans-related apparel, including women's and girls' casualwear, bearing the
Tommy Jeans and Tommy Hilfiger trademarks.  Pepe USA markets its products
principally through in-store shops and fixtured areas in leading department
stores and through leading specialty stores.  Pepe Far East and its subsidiaries
perform buying agency services for womenswear and jeanswear under the Tommy
Jeans and Tommy Hilfiger trademarks for both Pepe USA and the Company's third-
party distributors outside the United States.

     Pursuant to a license granted by the Company, TH Canada had exclusive
Canadian rights to source, manufacture and distribute apparel bearing the Tommy
Hilfiger and Tommy Jeans trademarks, including men's sportswear and
athleticwear, boys' sportswear, women's and girls' casualwear and men's, women's
and girls' jeanswear.  TH Canada markets Tommy Hilfiger and Tommy Jeans products
principally through leading specialty stores and through in-store shops and
fixtured areas in leading department stores.

     Information on the components of the Company's pro forma net revenue,
giving effect to the Acquisition, is presented in Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.  For more information relating to the
Acquisition, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7, Note

Merchandising Strategies

Wholesale

     The Company organizes its men's and children's apparel collections,
including products produced under licensing arrangements, into three primary
product lines:  Core, Core Plus and Fashion.

Core

     The Core line is comprised of the Company's seasonless, or very basic,
products all in classic solid colors.  Core items are made available for sale by
the Company throughout the year and, therefore, generally are kept in stock by
the Company.  Since Core items are seasonless, they do not have fixed selling
periods and, therefore, retailers' inventories of Core products tend to be
maintained throughout the year and reordered as necessary.  The Company receives
orders from most of its larger customers for Core products on an electronic data
interchange ("EDI") system, which expedites reorders.  See "Management
Information Systems."

Core Plus

     The Core Plus line is comprised of a broad selection of seasonal "basics"
which are derived from Core but offer a greater variety of fabrics, colors and
patterns, such as stripes and plaids.  The Core Plus line also incorporates
certain Fashion products that had previously been successful at retail.  The
Company sells four different seasonal groups of Core Plus products each year.
As compared to Fashion items, Core Plus items provide the retailer with longer
selling periods at regular prices.  Because Core Plus is a broader product
category than Fashion, with a longer regular-price selling period, the Company's
shipping deadlines are more flexible and the Company may be able to place
reorders when demand is high.

Fashion

     The Fashion line represents the most updated component of the Company's
product line.  Fashion items consist of a group of product classifications
coordinated around a seasonal theme.  The Company offers Fashion products under
at least three themes per season, thereby creating a continual flow of new
merchandise in the marketplace.

Licensing and Distributorships

     In connection with the Company's business strategy of expanding its market
penetration through product line and geographic expansion, the Company considers
entering into licensing and distribution agreements with respect to certain
products and geographic regions if the Company believes such arrangements
provide more effective manufacturing, distribution and marketing of such
products than could be achieved in-house.  The Company continually pursues new
opportunities in product categories which are believed to be complementary to
its existing product lines, as well as opportunities for geographic expansion
through licenses and distributorships to enhance its international presence.

     As shown in the table below, since Fall 1992, the Company has introduced
numerous product lines through license arrangements with companies which are
among the industry leaders in their respective categories and has entered into
several strategic geographic licenses and distributorships:

     In addition to a royalty payment or license fee, all of the Company's
licensees and distributors are required to contribute to the advertisement and
promotion of Tommy Hilfiger products on the basis of a percentage of their net
sales of Tommy Hilfiger products or a

                                       6
<PAGE>

percentage of their net purchases of Tommy Hilfiger products (depending on the
terms of the license or distributorship agreement), subject to minimum amounts.


Retailing

     The Company believes its outlet store business has positioned it to take
advantage of an important segment of the retail apparel industry that appeals to
customers' value orientation and provides the Company with an additional channel
of distribution.  The Company stocks its outlet stores with first-quality
products manufactured specifically for its outlet stores' customers and, to a
small degree, with out-of-season products.  As of March 31, 1999, the Company
operated 73 outlet stores and currently plans to open approximately 8 to 10
additional outlet stores by March 31, 2000.  The Company's outlet stores are
located primarily in major outlet centers in the United States.  As of March 31,
1999, the Company operated five specialty retail stores, including a store in
London, England, and two flagship stores.  In connection with the Acquisition,
the Company concluded that its specialty store formats could not adequately
accommodate its broad array of merchandise, and decided to discontinue these
operations in their present form.  During fiscal 1999, the Company closed three
of its specialty stores.

     Flagship stores serve as showcases for all of the Company's products as it
seeks to further establish the brand in the elite circle of designers with
international recognition.  This investment underlines the Company's strong
belief in the role of flagships as image builders for the Tommy Hilfiger brand.
These stores may be followed by a flagship in New York City, which represents an
additional key market.


Design

     Tommy Hilfiger is the Company's principal designer and provides leadership
and direction for all aspects of the design process.  Tommy Hilfiger selects
designers on the basis of their understanding of the retail industry and their
ability to understand what consumers desire and which designs are most likely to
be commercially viable.  Design teams are responsible for separate product
classifications.  In addition, the Company has senior designers, whose
responsibility is to coordinate the design teams.  Design teams utilize computer
aided design stations, which provide timely translation of designs into sample
depictions varying in color, cut and style.  The speed of production and breadth
of the resulting output assist the Company in selecting desirable designs for
the sourcing and research and development staffs to assess.


Research and Development

     The Company employs senior production executives who oversee a staff whose
primary functions are to identify ways to develop new designs and products more
efficiently, and to identify new and more cost-effective sourcing methods.  This
group receives new product direction from Tommy Hilfiger and then researches and
develops the potential product.  This process is designed to avoid costly
attempts to develop products that require designs or production methods that are
not efficient.  In addition, the staff researches and identifies new sources for
both fabrics and manufacturing worldwide in order to control or reduce
manufacturing costs while maintaining the Company's quality standards.

                                       7

Sales and Marketing

     Tommy Hilfiger products are sold throughout the United States in major
department and specialty retail store locations.  The Company's department store
customers include major United States retailers such as Dillard Department
Stores, Federated Department Stores (including Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and
Burdines), The May Department Stores Company (including Lord & Taylor and
Foley's), Belk Stores, Saks, Inc. and Dayton Hudson Corporation.  The Company
believes that its relationships with major retailers, including the active sales
involvement of the Company's senior management, are important elements of its
marketing strategy.  The Company's strategy is to continue to grow by broadening
its United States in-store shop and fixtured areas program, expanding its
product lines and marketing to new customers both in the United States and
internationally.

     A significant aspect of the Company's ability to increase the commitment of
its existing customers and to attract new customers is its in-store shop and
fixturing program, whereby participating retailers set aside floor space
highlighted by distinctive fixtures dedicated for exclusive sale of the
Company's products by the retailer.  This program enables the retailer to create
an environment consistent with the Company's image and to display and stock a
greater volume of the Company's products per square foot of retail space. Such
shops and fixtured areas encourage longer-term commitment by the retailer to the
Company's products, including the retailer's provision of upgraded staffing.
These shops and fixtured areas also increase consumer product recognition and
loyalty because of the retail customer's familiarity with the location of the
Company's products in the store. The continued expansion of the Company's in-
store shop and fixturing programs is dependent on market conditions, including
continued demand for the Company's products.

     The Company's sales and marketing departments include individuals located
in the Company's New York headquarters, Atlanta and Dallas showrooms and Los
Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Cincinnati regional sales
territories.  The sales force sells only the Tommy Hilfiger collection.

     The Company employs an extensive staff of merchandise coordinators located
throughout the United States.  These merchandisers educate the retailers'
salespeople about the Company's current products, provide the Company with
first-hand consumer feedback concerning consumer reaction to the Company's
products and coordinate the in-store displays with the department stores.  In
addition to the coordinator program, the Company also conducts a training
program for the department stores' Tommy Hilfiger selling specialists.  The
program is designed to educate specialists on the Company's image and
merchandising standards and to promote the development and servicing of
clientele.  The program educates specialists in customer assistance and advice,
including merchandise selection and the coordination of complete outfits of
Tommy Hilfiger products.

     The Company sells substantially all its out-of-season products, which are
principally from the Fashion and Core Plus product lines, to certain discount
retailers and through its Company owned outlet stores.  The net revenues from
such sales represented less than 15% of the Company's total net revenue for each
of the last three fiscal years.

                                       8

Advertising, Public Relations and Promotion

     The Company believes that advertising to promote and enhance the Tommy
Hilfiger brand and the image of Tommy Hilfiger products is important to its
long-term growth strategy.  All of the Company's licensees and distributors are
required to contribute to the advertisement and promotion of Tommy Hilfiger
products a percentage of their net sales of Tommy Hilfiger products or a
percentage of their net purchases of Tommy Hilfiger products (depending on the
terms of the license or distributorship agreement), subject to minimum amounts.
Advertising by the Company, its licensees and most of its distributors is
coordinated by the Company and principally appears in magazines, newspapers, and
outdoor advertising media.  In addition, selected personal appearances by Tommy
Hilfiger, corporate sponsorships and charitable programs are utilized to further
enhance awareness of the Company's image and promote the Company's products.
The Company employs an advertising and public relations staff to implement these
efforts.


Sourcing

     The Company's sourcing strategy is to contract for the manufacture of its
products.  Outsourcing allows the Company to maximize production flexibility
while avoiding significant capital expenditures, work-in-process inventory
buildups and the costs of managing a large production work force.  The Company
inspects products manufactured by contractors to determine whether they meet the
Company's standards.  See "Quality Control."

     The Company imports most of its finished goods because it believes it can
import higher quality products at lower costs than could be achieved
domestically.  Management maintains extensive and long-term relationships with
leading manufacturers in the Far East, including, among others, manufacturers
located in Indonesia, Thailand, India, the Philippines, Taiwan and Mauritius.
None of the countries from which the Company sources accounts for more than 15%
of the total cost of products purchased.  The Company monitors duty, tariff and
quota-related developments and continually seeks to minimize its potential
exposure to duty, tariff and quota-related risks through, among other measures,
geographical diversification of its manufacturing sources, the maintenance of
its buying offices in Hong Kong, Macau, India and the United States, allocation
of production to merchandise categories where more quota is available and shifts
of production among countries and manufacturers.

     The Company's production and sourcing staff oversees all aspects of apparel
manufacturing and production, the negotiation for raw materials and research and
development of new products and sources.  The Company's buying offices perform
product development, sourcing, production scheduling and quality control.  In
addition, the Company contracts with various buying subagents that perform
similar services for the Company and its licensees and geographic distributors,
for specified commissions.

     The Company has its products manufactured according to plans prepared each
year which reflect prior years' experience, current fashion trends, economic
conditions and management estimates of a line's performance.  In certain cases,
the Company separately negotiates with suppliers for the sale of required raw
materials, which are then purchased by its contractors in accordance with the
Company's specifications.  The Company limits its exposure to holding excess
inventory by committing to purchase a portion of total projected demand and the
Company, in its experience, has been able to satisfy its excess demand through
reorders.  The

                                       9
<PAGE>

Company believes that its policy of limiting its commitments for purchases early
in the season reduces its exposure to excess inventory and obsolescence.

     As noted above, the Company does not own or operate any manufacturing
facilities and is therefore dependent upon third parties for the manufacture of
all its products.  The inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of the
Company's products in a timely manner, including as a result of local financial
market disruption which could impair the ability of such suppliers to finance
their operations, or to meet quality standards, could cause the Company to miss
the delivery date requirements of its customers for those items, which could
result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in
purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations.  The Company has no
long-term formal arrangements with any of its suppliers and historically has
experienced only limited difficulty in satisfying its raw material and finished
goods requirements.  Although the Company believes it could replace such
suppliers without a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no
assurance that such suppliers could be replaced in a timely manner, and the loss
of such suppliers could have a significant effect on the Company's short-term
operating results.


Quality Control

     The Company's quality control program is designed to ensure that purchased
goods meet the Company's standards.  The Company inspects prototypes of each
product prior to cutting by the contractors and performs two in-line inspections
and a final inspection prior to shipment.  All finished goods are shipped to the
Company's New Jersey facilities for re-inspection and distribution.  While the
Company's return policy permits customers to return defective products for
credit, less than 1% of the Company's shipments in fiscal 1999 were returned as
defective under this policy.


Management Information Systems

     The Company believes that high levels of automation and technology are
essential to maintain its competitive position and the Company continues to
invest in computer hardware, systems applications and networks to enhance and to
speed the apparel design process, to support the sale and distribution of
products to its customers and to improve the integration and efficiency of its
United States and Far East operations.  The Company utilizes computer-aided
design stations for use by the design teams, which provide timely translations
of designs into sample depictions varying in color, cut and style.  The Company
also uses an EDI system to receive on-line orders from its customers and to
accumulate sales information on its products.  The EDI technology enables the
Company to provide valuable sales information and inventory maintenance
information services to its customers who have adopted such technology.  Nine of
the Company's 10 largest customers communicate with the Company through EDI
technology.

     See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Year 2000" in Item 7.


Distribution

     In the United States, wholesale distribution occurs at three New Jersey
facilities which average approximately 342,000 square feet.  The facilities are
operated and principally staffed by

                                      10
<PAGE>

an independent contractor who charges the Company on the basis of the number of
items processed, subject to a minimum annual fee. In addition, the Company
utilizes a 203,000 square foot facility in New Jersey for retail distribution.
The Company maintains its distribution management group and certain
administrative functions at its New Jersey facilities.

     The Company's Canadian distribution is processed through a 174,000 square
foot facility located in Montreal, Quebec.

Credit and Collection

     The Company collects substantially all of its receivables from U.S.
customers through a credit company subsidiary of a large financial institution
pursuant to an agreement whereby the credit company pays the Company after the
credit company receives payment from the Company's customer. The credit company
establishes maximum credit limits for each customer account. If the customer
becomes bankrupt or insolvent the credit company pays the Company 50% of the
outstanding receivable. If the receivable becomes 120 days past due, the full
amount is reimbursable by the credit company.

     The Company has a similar arrangement with another large financial
institution for credit services to its Canadian subsidiary. In both cases the
Company believes that the credit risk associated with such financial
institutions is minimal.

     Bad debts as a percentage of net sales were less than 0.1% in each of the
Company's last three fiscal years.

Trademarks

     The Company owns and utilizes eight principal trademarks: the names TOMMY
HILFIGER (R), TOMMY JEANS(R), TOMMY(R), TOMMY GIRL(R) and HILFIGER ATHLETIC(TM),
and the distinctive flag logo, crest design and green eyelet device. Tommy
Hilfiger Licensing, Inc. ("THLI") is a subsidiary of Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc.
("TH USA"), which is a subsidiary of THC. THLI has registered or applied for
registration for these trademarks for use in the United States and in numerous
countries worldwide, including, inter alia, in North America, Europe, Asia,
South and Central America. The Company regards its trademarks and other
proprietary intellectual property rights as valuable assets in the marketing of
its products. THLI is a party to an agreement with Mr. Hilfiger that restricts
the sale, lease, license or other conveyance of THLI's trademarks, the amendment
of the license agreement between THLI and TH USA, and the creation of any lien
on THLI's trademarks without Mr. Hilfiger's consent, until Mr. Hilfiger's death,
or until termination of Mr. Hilfiger's employment with TH USA without the
consent of TH USA.

Backlog

     The Company generally receives orders approximately three to five months
prior to the time the products are delivered to stores. Thus, the Company's
backlog of orders, which the Company believes, based on industry practice and
past experience, will result in sales, at March 31, 1999 represents a
significant portion of the Company's expected sales through September 30, 1999.
At March 31, 1999, the Company's backlog of orders was approximately $820
million, compared to approximately $303 million at March 31, 1998. Management
believes that the pro
                                       11
<PAGE>

forma backlog as of March 31, 1998, including that of the Acquired Companies,
was approximately $638 million. The Company's backlog depends upon a number of
factors, including the timing of "market weeks" during which a significant
percentage of the Company's orders are received and the timing of shipments.
Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily
meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments.


Competition; Changes in Fashion Trends

  The apparel industry is highly competitive.  The Company competes with
numerous domestic and foreign designers, brands and manufacturers of apparel,
accessories and other products, some of which may be significantly larger and
more diversified, and have greater resources, than the Company.  In addition,
the Company believes that its success depends in substantial part on its ability
to anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demand and fashion trends
in a timely manner.  The Company attempts to minimize the risk of changing
fashion trends and product acceptance by closely monitoring retail sales trends.
However, if fashion trends shift away from the Company's products, or if the
Company otherwise misjudges the market for its product lines, it may be faced
with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory or other conditions
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.


Dependence on Customers Under Common Control

     The Company's department store customers include major United States
retailers, certain of which are under common ownership.  When considered
together as a group under common ownership, sales to the department store
customers which were owned by Dillard Department Stores, Federated Department
Stores and The May Department Stores Company accounted for approximately 20%,
18%, and 14%, respectively, of the Company's fiscal 1999 net wholesale product
sales.  A decision by the controlling owner of a group of department stores to
decrease the amount purchased from the Company or to cease carrying the
Company's products could have a material adverse effect on the Company.


Employees

     At March 31, 1999, the Company had approximately 2,300 full-time employees
and 700 part-time employees.  Virtually all of the Company's part-time employees
were employed in the Company's retail stores.  None of the Company's employees
is a member of a union.  The Company considers its relations with its employees
to be excellent.

     The Company operates 73 outlet stores, each averaging approximately 3,900

stores in metropolitan areas, including one in London, England, each averaging
approximately 3,300 square feet, and two flagship stores, each averaging
approximately 18,000 square feet, one in Beverly Hills, California and one in
London, England.  In addition, the Company has two regional showrooms outside of
New York City and an administrative office in Wilmington, Delaware.  All of such
stores and showrooms are leased.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Saipan Litigation.  On January 13, 1999, two actions were filed against the
     -----------------
Company and other garment manufacturers and retailers asserting claims that
garment factories located on the island of Saipan, which allegedly supply
product to the Company and other co-defendants, engage in unlawful practices
relating to the recruitment and employment of foreign workers.  One action,
brought in San Francisco Superior Court (the "State Action"), was filed by a
union and three public interest groups alleging unfair competition and false
advertising by the Company and others.  It seeks equitable relief, restitution
and disgorgement of profits relating to the allegedly wrongful conduct, as well
as interest and an award of fees to the plaintiffs' attorneys.  The other, an
action seeking class action status filed in federal court for the Central
District of California  (the "Federal Action"), was brought on behalf of an
alleged class consisting of the Saipanese factory workers.  The defendants
include both companies selling goods purchased from factories located on the
island of Saipan and the factories themselves.  This complaint alleges claims
under RICO, the Alien Tort Claims Act, federal anti-peonage and indentured
servitude statutes and state and international law.  It seeks equitable relief
and damages, including treble and punitive damages, interest and an award of
fees to the plaintiffs' attorneys.

     In addition, the same law firm that filed the State Action and the Federal
Action has filed an action seeking class action status in the Federal Court in
Saipan.  This action is brought on behalf of Saipanese garment factory workers
against the Saipanese factories and alleges violation of federal and Saipanese
wage and employment laws.  The Company is not a defendant in this action.

     In the State Action, all defendants, including the Company, have filed a
demurrer challenging the legal sufficiency of the complaint.  In the Federal
Action, all defendants, including the Company, have filed a motion to transfer
venue and a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.  The
plaintiffs have not yet filed their opposition to these motions.

                                      13
<PAGE>

   Shareholder Derivative Litigation.  On February 2, 1998, February 12, 1998
   ---------------------------------
and February 17, 1998, three alleged holders of Ordinary Shares filed purported
derivative actions in New York State court on behalf of the Company against the
members of the Board of Directors.  The actions were later consolidated and an
amended complaint was served on May 29, 1998.  The amended complaint alleged
that the Board's approval of the Acquisition constituted a breach of fiduciary
duty and corporate waste, and sought equitable relief and damages in favor of
the Company, and an award of fees to the plaintiffs' attorneys.  On June 15,
1998, the Company and its directors moved to dismiss the consolidated action on
several grounds.  On December 9, 1998, the Court dismissed the action, ruling
that the British Virgin Islands, the Company's place of incorporation, is the
appropriate forum in which to litigate these derivative claims.  In January
1999, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with respect to the Court's
ruling.

   The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time involved in routine
legal matters incidental to their businesses.  In the opinion of the Company's
management, based on advice of counsel, the resolution of these matters will not
have a material effect on its financial position or its results of operations.

     In the past two fiscal years, the Company has not paid any dividends.  The
Company anticipates that all of its earnings in the foreseeable future will be
retained for the development and

expansion of its business and, therefore, has no current plans to pay cash
dividends. Future dividend policy will depend on the Company's earnings, capital
requirement, financal condition, restrictions imposed by agreements governing
indebtness of the Company and its subsidiaries, availability of dividends from
subsidiaries, receipt of funds in connection with repayment of loans to
subsidiaries or advances from operating subsidiaries and other factors
considered revelant by the Board of Directors of the Company. For certain
restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries of the Company to pay dividends to
the Company, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7.

     Year Ended March 31, 1999 (Pro Forma) Compared to Year Ended March 31,
                               1998 (Pro Forma)

     The following discussion of the Company's results of operations for the
year ended March 31, 1999 compared to the year ended March 31, 1998 is presented
on a pro forma basis, assuming the Acquired Companies had been combined with the
Company for each of the entire twelve month periods.  The pro forma financial
information is derived by applying pro forma adjustments to the historical
financial statements of the Company and the Acquired Companies.  The pro forma
adjustments consist of (a) the elimination of certain revenues, cost of goods
sold and royalty expense, (b) amortization of intangible assets, principally
over 40 years, (c) incremental interest and other expenses and (d) applicable
income tax effects.  These pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of
the results that would have occurred had the businesses been combined for the
periods indicated.

     Net revenue increased to $1,685,523 in fiscal 1999 from $1,270,811 in
fiscal 1998, an improvement of 32.6%.  This increase is due to increases in each
of the Company's operating divisions, as outlined below.

     The Wholesale increase consists of increases in menswear sales of 13.4% (to
$795,796 from $701,552), womenswear sales of 123.0% (to $405,783 from $181,926)
and childrenswear sales of 55.8% (to $213,348 from $136,910).  Each of these
improvements is due to volume increases which resulted primarily from increased
sales to existing customers.  The increased sales to existing customers is
principally due to the expansion of the in-store shop and fixtured area
programs, whereby certain of the Company's customers have increased the amount
of square footage where the Company's products are featured.  Revenues in the
womenswear division increased in part due to the introduction of the junior
jeans line in Fall, 1998, while sales in the childrenswear division benefited
from the introduction of infants and toddlers in Holiday, 1997.

     The improvement in the Company's Retail division is due to an increase in
the number of stores, partially offset by a decrease in sales at existing
stores.  At March 31, 1999, the Company operated 80 retail stores as compared to
66 stores at March 31, 1998.  Retail stores opened since March 31, 1998
contributed $29,662 of net revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999.

     Revenue from the Licensing division, which consists of licensing royalties
and buying agency commissions, increased due to a general increase in sales of
existing licensed products and buying agency services and the incremental
revenue associated with newly licensed products.  Of the increase, $3,191, or
21.0%, was due to products introduced under licenses entered into since March
31, 1998.

     Other non-recurring revenue consists of sales of Pepe brand product as well
as product sales of the jeanswear buying office, each of which will not recur
prospectively.

     Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased to 46.7% in fiscal
1999 from 46.5% in fiscal 1998.  This increase is due to improved wholesale
margins, offset, in part, by a reduction in the  proportion of revenue from the
Retail and Licensing divisions, each of which produces higher margins than the
Company's consolidated total.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses, before the special charge
described below, decreased to 28.3% of net revenue in fiscal 1999 from 29.8% of
net revenue in fiscal 1998. The decrease as a percentage of net revenue is
primarily due to leveraging certain expenses against the higher revenue base.
The increase in expenses to $476,768 in fiscal 1999 from $377,733 in fiscal 1998
is principally due to increased volume related expenses to support the higher
revenue as well as increased depreciation and amortization.  Included in
selling, general and administrative expenses is amortization of goodwill and
acquired intangibles of $34,528 and $36,008 in fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998,
respectively.

     During the quarter ended June 30, 1998, the Company recorded a special
charge for non-recurring expenses of $19,800, before income taxes, related to
the Acquisition.  This special charge consists of provisions of $7,000 for the
write-off of the fixed assets and operating leases of the Company's specialty
stores, $7,000 for redundant MIS equipment, furniture, fixtures and other
equipment, $3,800 for severance and other employee costs and $2,000 for the
termination of certain vendor contracts.

     Interest expense, net of interest income, has decreased to $38,256 in
fiscal 1999 from $46,274 last year.  Interest expense includes interest on the
debt incurred in connection with the Acquisition.  The decrease from fiscal 1998
to fiscal 1999 is primarily due to improved cash flow and, therefore, lower
borrowing levels of both the Company and the Acquired Companies.

     The provision for income taxes has decreased to 29.5% of income before
taxes in the twelve month period ended March 31, 1999 from 30.2% in the
corresponding period last year.  This decrease was primarily attributable to the
relative level of earnings in the various taxing jurisdictions to which the
Company's earnings are subject, together with the effects of the special charges
which are tax effected at a higher rate than the Company's weighted average tax
rate.


          Year Ended March 31, 1999 (Actual) Compared to Year Ended March 31,
                                  1998 (Actual)

     Net revenue increased to $1,637,073 in fiscal 1999 from $847,110 in fiscal
1998, an improvement of 93.3%.  This increase is due to increases in the
Company's Wholesale and Retail divisions, partially offset by a decrease in the
Licensing division, as outlined below.

</TABLE>

     The Wholesale increase is due to volume increases which resulted from the
Acquisition and from increased sales to existing customers.  This increase is
principally attributed to the change in status of Pepe USA and TH Canada, which
contributed to the Company in the form of royalty income for the entire fiscal
year ended March 31, 1998, compared to a combination of royalty income and
wholesale revenue (since the Acquisition) in the fiscal year ended March 31,
1999.  A comparison of Wholesale revenue components after adjusting for these
changes is made in the previous section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

     The improvement in the Company's Retail division is due to an increase in
the number of stores, partially offset by a decrease in sales at existing
stores.  At March 31, 1999, the Company operated 80 retail stores as compared to
66 stores at March 31, 1998.  Retail stores opened since March 31, 1998
contributed $29,662 of net revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999.

     Revenue from the Licensing division, which consists of licensing royalties
and buying agency commissions, decreased due to the change in status of Pepe USA
and TH Canada mentioned above offset, in part, by a general increase in sales of
existing licensed products and buying agency services and the incremental
revenue associated with newly licensed products.  For fiscal 1999, $3,191 of the
revenue amount was due to products introduced under licenses entered into since
March 31, 1998.

                                      19
<PAGE>

     Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 46.7% in fiscal
1999 from 47.2% in fiscal 1998.  This decrease is primarily due to the increased
proportion of revenue from the Wholesale divisions following the Acquisition.
Partially offsetting this decrease, the Wholesale margin improved during fiscal
1999 due to the addition of the Acquired Companies.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses, before the special charge
described above, increased to 28.4% of net revenue in fiscal 1999 from 28.0% of
net revenue in fiscal 1998.  The increase as a percentage of net revenue is
primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization, including
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles of $31,651 during fiscal 1999,
partially offset by leveraging certain expenses against the higher revenue base.
The increase in expenses to $464,385 in fiscal 1999 from $236,571 in fiscal 1998
is principally due to increased volume related expenses to support the higher
revenue as well as increased depreciation and amortization.

     The Company incurred interest expense, net of interest income, of $33,910
in fiscal 1999 and generated net interest income of $5,755 last year.  Interest
expense in the current year includes interest on the debt incurred in connection
with the Acquisition.

     The provision for income taxes has decreased to 29.5% of income before
taxes in the twelve month period ended March 31, 1999 from 32.9% in the
corresponding period last year.  This decrease was primarily attributable to the
relative level of earnings in the various taxing jurisdictions to which the
Company's earnings are subject, together with the effects of the special charges
which are tax effected at a higher rate than the Company's weighted average tax
rate.

      Year Ended March 31, 1998 (Actual) Compared to Year Ended March 31,
                                 1997 (Actual)

  Net revenue increased $185,422, or 28.0%, to $847,110 in fiscal 1998 from
$661,688 in fiscal 1997.  This improvement is principally due to volume
increases in each of the Company's operating divisions, as outlined below.

  Wholesale net revenue increased to $587,922 in fiscal 1998 from $479,307 in
fiscal 1997, an improvement of $108,615 or 22.7%.  This improvement consists of
a menswear wholesale sales increase of 12.3% and a childrenswear wholesale sales
increase of 79.5%.  In fiscal 1998, menswear wholesale sales were $455,127 while
childrenswear wholesale sales were $132,795.  In fiscal 1997, menswear wholesale
sales were $405,319 while childrenswear wholesale sales were $73,988.  These
increases were due to increases in volume, which resulted primarily from
increased sales to existing customers, offset by a decrease in the average sales
price per unit.  The increased sales to existing customers were partially the
result of the Company's in-store shop and fixtured area expansion program,
whereby certain of the Company's customers have increased the amount of square
footage where the Company's products are featured.

  Net revenue in the Company's Retail division increased 31.3% to $196,066 in
fiscal 1998 from $149,312 in fiscal 1997.  The increase in the number of stores,
as well as an increase in sales at existing stores, contributed to the improved
revenue.  Of the total increase of $46,754, $17,371 was attributable to retail
stores opened since March 31, 1997.  The total number of retail stores open as
of March 31, 1998 and 1997 were 66 and 55, respectively.

  Net revenue from royalties and buying agency commissions increased 90.9% to
$63,122 in fiscal 1998 from $33,069 in fiscal 1997.  Of the increase of $30,053,
approximately 31.8% was due

                                      20
<PAGE>

to the introduction of new licensed products since March 31, 1997. The remainder
of the increase reflects the incremental revenue associated with a general
increase in sales of existing licensed products and buying agency services.
Included in net revenue from royalties and buying agency commissions is $22,901
and $12,341, in fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997, respectively, from the Company's
womenswear, jeanswear and Canadian licensees, which were acquired by the Company
effective May 8, 1998.

  Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 47.2% in fiscal 1998
from 47.9% in fiscal 1997.  This decrease is attributable to lower margins in
menswear wholesale operations and a greater contribution to wholesale operations
of childrenswear, which typically produces lower margins than menswear.  This
was partially offset by increased royalty and buying agency commissions, which
produce higher margins than wholesale and retail operations.

  Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net revenue,
decreased to 28.0% in fiscal 1998 from 28.9% in fiscal 1997.  This decrease is
due to the leveraging of these expenses against the higher revenue base.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $236,571 in fiscal
1998 from $190,976 in fiscal 1997.  This increase is primarily due to increased
volume related expenses of the Company's wholesale and retail operations to
support the higher revenue.  In addition, depreciation and amortization has
increased due to the greater number of in-store shops and fixtured areas.

  The provision for taxes decreased to 32.9% of income before taxes in fiscal
1998 from 34.2% in fiscal 1997.  The decrease was primarily attributable to the
relative level of earnings in the various taxing jurisdictions to which the
Company's earnings are subject.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

  The Company's primary ongoing funding requirements are to finance working
capital and the continued growth of the business.  Principally, this includes
the purchase of inventory in anticipation of increased sales of the Wholesale
and Retail divisions as well as capital expenditures related to the expansion of
the Company's in-store shop and fixtured area programs and additional retail
stores.  The Company's sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash from
operations and the Company's available credit.  Additionally, the Company
required Acquisition-related financing in May 1998 as discussed further below.

  The Company's cash and cash equivalents balance increased from $157,051 at
March 31, 1998 to $241,950 at March 31, 1999.  This represented an overall
increase of $84,899 due primarily to cash provided by operating activities,
partially offset by cash used in investing activities.  A detailed analysis of
the changes in cash and cash equivalents is presented in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.

  Capital expenditures were $79,422 in fiscal 1999, compared with $67,814 on an
actual basis and $96,295 on a pro forma basis in fiscal 1998. Significant
capital expenditures included additions related to the Company's flagship stores
and in-store shop and fixtured area expansion program.

  At March 31, 1999, accrued expenses and other current liabilities included
$48,081 of open letters of credit for inventory purchased.  Additionally, at
March 31, 1999, TH USA was contingently liable for unexpired bank letters of
credit of $72,419 related to commitments of TH USA to suppliers for the purchase
of inventories.

                                      21

  On May 8, 1998, the Company acquired its womenswear, jeanswear and Canadian
licensees for an aggregate purchase price of $755,760 in cash and 9,045,930
Ordinary Shares of the Company.  The cash portion of the purchase price was
funded from a combination of debt financing and cash on hand.  The debt
financing portion of the purchase price consisted of $250,000 of 6.50% notes
maturing on June 1, 2003 (the "2003 Notes"), $200,000 of 6.85% notes maturing on
June 1, 2008 (the "2008 Notes") and $200,000 of term loan borrowings pursuant to
new $450,000 term and revolving credit facilities (the "Credit Facilities").
The 2003 Notes and the 2008 Notes (collectively, the "Notes") were issued by TH
USA and guaranteed by THC.  The indenture under which the Notes were issued
contains covenants that are more fully explained in Note 7 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

  The Credit Facilities, which are guaranteed by THC, consist of an unsecured
$250,000 TH USA five-year revolving credit facility, of which up to $150,000 may
be used for direct borrowings, and an unsecured $200,000 five-year term loan
facility which was borrowed by TH USA in connection with the Acquisition and
remains outstanding at March 31, 1999.  The term loan bears interest at variable
rates which, on a weighted average basis, amounted to 5.66% and 6.19% as of, and
for the period ended, March 31, 1999, respectively.  The revolving credit
facility will be available for letters of credit, working capital and other
general corporate purposes.  The Credit Facilities replaced the Company's
secured revolving credit agreement which had been in place since April 1, 1996.

  Borrowings under the term loan facility are repayable in quarterly
installments as follows:  $40,000 in the 12-month period ending March 31, 2000;
$50,000 in each of the next two succeeding 12-month periods; and $60,000 in the
next succeeding 12-month period.

  Under the Credit Facilities, subsidiaries of THC may not pay dividends or make
other payments in respect of capital stock to THC that in the aggregate exceed
33% of the Company's cumulative consolidated net income, commencing with the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, less certain deductions.  The Credit
Facilities also contain a number of other restrictive covenants that are more
fully explained in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

  The Company was in compliance with all covenants in respect of the Notes and
the Credit Facilities as of March 31, 1999.

  The Company attempts to mitigate the risks associated with adverse movements
in interest rates by establishing and maintaining a favorable balance of fixed
and floating rate debt and cash on hand.  Management also believes that
significant flexibility remains available in the form of additional borrowing
capacity and the ability to prepay term debt, if so desired, in response to
changing conditions in the debt markets.  Because such flexibility exists, the
Company does not normally enter into specific hedging transactions to further
mitigate interest rate risks, except in the case of specific, material borrowing
transactions such as those associated with the Acquisition.  No interest rate
hedging contracts were in place as of March 31, 1999.

  There were no significant committed capital expenditures at March 31, 1999.
The Company expects fiscal 2000 capital expenditures to approximate $130,000 to
$150,000.  The Company intends to fund such cash requirements for fiscal 2000
and future years from available cash balances, internally generated funds and
borrowings available under the Credit Facilities.  The Company believes that
these resources will be sufficient to fund its cash requirements for such
periods.

                                      22

Inflation

  The Company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation
experienced over the last few years in the United States, where it primarily
competes, have had a significant effect on its net revenue or profitability.
Higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries
in which the Company's products are manufactured but have not had a material
effect on the Company's net revenue or profitability.  The Company has
historically been able to partially offset its cost increases by increasing
prices or changing suppliers.


Exchange Rates

  The Company receives United States dollars for substantially all of its
product sales.  Substantially all inventory purchases from contract
manufacturers throughout the world are also denominated in United States
dollars; however, purchase prices for the Company's products may be impacted by
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the local
currencies of the contract manufacturers, which may have the effect of
increasing the Company's cost of goods in the future.  During the last three
fiscal years, exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the
Company's inventory costs; however, due to the number of currencies involved and
the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the
United States dollar, the Company cannot quantify in any meaningful way the
potential effect of such fluctuations on future income.  The Company does not
engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk.

  The Company does, however, seek to protect against adverse movements in
foreign currency which might affect certain firm commitments or transactions.
These include the purchase of inventory, capital expenditures and the collection
of certain foreign receivables.  The Company enters into forward contracts with
maturities of up to one year to sell or purchase foreign currency in order to
hedge against such risks.  The Company does not use financial instruments for
speculative or trading purposes.  No significant gain or loss was inherent in
such contracts at March 31, 1999.  While a hypothetical 10% adverse change in
all of the relevant exchange rates would potentially cause a decrease in the
fair value of the contracts of approximately $2,359, the Company would
experience an offsetting benefit in the spot rate on the associated underlying
transactions.


Recently Issued Accounting Standards

  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative and Hedging
Activities" ("SFAS 133").  It is expected that SFAS 133 will be effective for
the Company beginning in fiscal 2002.  SFAS 133 requires that all derivative
instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.  Changes in
the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or
other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as
part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
Management of the Company anticipates that, due to the limited use of derivative
instruments, the nature of such instruments and the nature of the underlying
transactions being hedged, the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a significant
effect on the Company's results of operations or its financial position.

                                      23
<PAGE>

Year 2000

    During the year ended March 31, 1998, the Company initiated a comprehensive
program to evaluate and address the impact of the year 2000 on its operations
and those of the Acquired Companies in order to ensure that its computer systems
properly recognize calendar year 2000.  This program included steps to identify
each item or element that would require date code remediation and make
appropriate modifications to ensure a seamless transition to the year 2000.  The
Company has now completed the major portion of its internal date remediation
activity.

    The Company is using internal staff resources to accomplish most of this
activity and estimates that the cost will not exceed $500.  Certain other costs,
which are capitalized, represent investment in new hardware and software systems
upgrades, the timing of which was planned to coincide with the integration of
the Acquired Companies.  Principal among these is a new investment in packaged
financial systems software to which the Company and its major subsidiaries
converted during 1999.  Such costs represent only a nominal percentage of
capital expenditures.  The estimate of costs of the Year 2000 compliance effort
and the timetable for internal Year 2000 modifications are management's best
estimates.  There can be no guarantee that these estimates will prove accurate
and actual results could differ materially from the estimates.  Based upon
progress to date, however, the Company believes that it is unlikely that actual
results would differ significantly from the estimates.

    The Company is also corresponding with significant suppliers, customers,
transportation carriers and general service providers whose computer systems'
functionality could impact the Company and in particular its ability to schedule
forward production and procurement of merchandise from suppliers and to fulfill
customer orders.  These communications will facilitate coordination of Year 2000
conversions and will additionally permit the Company to determine its exposure
to the failure of third parties to address their own Year 2000 issues.

    Although the Company is not aware of any material issues that would impede
its ability to prepare its internal systems for the year 2000, and therefore has
not prepared a contingency plan, there can be no assurance that the systems of
other companies on which the Company's processes rely will be timely converted,
or that a failure to successfully convert by another company, or a conversion
that is incompatible with the Company's systems, would not have an adverse
impact on the Company's operations.  The need for contingency plans in this
regard will continue to be assessed.

    The foregoing commentary should be considered to fall within the coverage of
the "Safe Harbor Statement" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995 included in this report.

                          TOMMY HILFIGER CORPORATION
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
            (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)


Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)  Basis of Consolidation

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tommy
Hilfiger Corporation ("THC" or the "Company"; unless the context indicates
otherwise, all references to the "Company" include THC and its subsidiaries) and
all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.

(b)  Organization and Business

     THC, through its subsidiaries, designs, sources and markets men's and
women's sportswear, jeanswear and childrenswear under the Tommy Hilfiger
trademarks. Through licensing agreements, the Company is expanding its product
lines to offer a broader array of apparel, accessories, footwear, fragrance and
home furnishings.

(c)  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments

     The Company considers all financial instruments purchased with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Short-term
investments include investments with an original maturity of greater than three
months and a remaining maturity of less than one year.

(d)  Inventories

     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (weighted average method) or
market.

(e)  Property and Equipment

     Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to twenty-five years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the
lesser of the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Major additions and betterments are capitalized and repairs and maintenance are
charged to operations in the period incurred. The Company's share of the cost of
constructing in-store shop displays is capitalized and amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. These costs are included
in "Furniture and fixtures".

(f)  Intangible Assets

     Intangible assets are comprised principally of goodwill and other
intangibles acquired during fiscal 1999 of $662,212 and $612,268, respectively.
The principal intangible assets acquired were the licenses between the Acquired
Companies (as defined in Note 15) and the Company described in Note 15, which
had remaining terms in excess of 40 years. Accordingly, these intangibles and
goodwill are being amortized principally over 40 years on a straight line basis.

                                      F-7
<PAGE>

(g)  Long Lived Assets

     The Company reviews long lived assets including goodwill and other
intangibles to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted
cash flows. Impairments would be recognized in earnings to the extent that
carrying value exceeds fair value.

(h)  Income Taxes

     The Company has recorded its provision for income taxes under the asset and
liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates.

(i)  Earnings Per Share and Authorized Shares

     Earnings per share and equivalents reflect the adoption of Statement of
Financial Acounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 128, "Earnings Per Share", in fiscal
1998. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potentially dilutive effect of
common stock issuable under the Company's stock option plans.

     Included in the Company's authorized, issued and outstanding shares are
9,045,930 shares issued in connection with the Acquisition (as defined in Note
15). Transfers of these shares are restricted for two years following the date
of the Acquisition with additional restrictions during the following three years
on transfers of the shares as a block, subject to certain exceptions.

(j)  Revenues

     Net revenues from wholesale product sales are recognized upon shipment of
products to customers. Allowances for estimated returns, discounts and doubtful
accounts are provided when sales are recorded. Retail store revenues are
recognized at the time of sale. Licensing royalties and buying agency fees are
recognized as earned.

     Net wholesale sales to major customers as a percentage of total net
wholesale sales, for the three-year period ended March 31, 1999 were as follows:

</TABLE>

                                      F-8
<PAGE>

(k)  Foreign Currency Translation

     The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in United
States dollars as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the Company operates, and the vast majority of its revenues are received
and expenses are disbursed in United States dollars. Adjustments resulting from
translating the financial statements of those non-United States subsidiaries
which do not use the United States dollar as their functional currency are
recorded in shareholders' equity.

(l)  Advertising Costs

     Advertising costs are charged to operations when incurred and totaled
$44,040, $21,841 and $19,651 during the years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively. The increase in advertising costs in fiscal 1999 is
principally due to the change in status of the Acquired Companies which made
advertising contributions to the Company prior to the Acquisition. Advertising
costs of the Acquired Companies were $14,718 and $8,459 in fiscal 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

(m)  Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(n)  Segments and Foreign Operations

     Effective January 1, 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No.131, "Disclosures
About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". This statement
establishes disclosure requirements about reportable operating segments as well
as related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major
customers.

     The Company's operations are reported on the basis of three segments:
wholesale, retail, and licensing, as further discussed in Note 10.

     Substantially all of the Company's net revenue and income from operations
as well as identifiable assets constitute foreign operations in that the Company
is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ("BVI").

(o)  Reclassification of Prior Year Balances

     Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to current
year presentation.

                                      F-9
<PAGE>

Note 2 - Cash Equivalents

     As of March 31, 1999, the balance in Cash and Cash Equivalents was
comprised entirely of overnight deposits at several financial institutions
earning interest at a weighted average interest rate of 4.64%. As part of its
ongoing control procedures, the Company monitors its concentration of deposits
with various financial institutions in order to avoid any undue exposure.


Note 3 - Financial Instruments

Accounts Receivable

     The Company collects substantially all of its receivables from U.S.
customers through a credit company subsidiary of a large financial institution
pursuant to an agreement whereby the credit company pays the Company after the
credit company receives payment from the Company's customer. The credit company
establishes maximum credit limits for each customer account. If the customer
becomes bankrupt or insolvent the credit company pays the Company 50% of the
outstanding receivable. If the receivable becomes 120 days past due, the full
amount is reimbursable by the credit company.

     The Company has a similar arrangement with another large financial
institution for credit services to its Canadian subsidiary. In both cases the
Company believes that the credit risk associated with such financial
institutions is minimal. The Company also may grant credit directly to customers
in the normal course of business without participation by a credit company. In
such cases the Company monitors its credit exposure limits to avoid any
significant concentration of risk. Bad debts have been minimal.


Interest Rate Risk Management

     Interest rate protection is used very selectively on certain borrowing
transactions. Such contracts are integral to the underlying borrowing
transaction and are therefore not recognized at fair value at any balance sheet
date. Following the announcement of the proposed Acquisition on February 1,
1998, the Company sold U.S. Treasury futures contracts to protect against the
potential increase in interest rates which would be in effect upon the funding
of the Acquisition. At March 31, 1998, such contracts, having a notional value
of $675,000, had generated deferred gains of approximately $4,490. The
cumulative gains of $3,737 resulting from changes in the market values of the
futures contracts through the time of transaction financing are being amortized
as adjustments to interest expense over the appropriate debt amortization
periods. No interest rate protection agreements existed at March 31, 1999.


Foreign Currency Risk Management

     The Company seeks to protect against adverse movements in foreign currency
which might affect certain firm commitments or transactions. These include the
purchase of inventory, capital expenditures and the collection of certain
foreign receivables. The Company enters into forward contracts with maturities
of up to one year to sell or purchase foreign currency in order

                                      F-10
<PAGE>

to hedge against such risks. The Company does not use financial instruments for
speculative or trading purposes.

     Gains and losses on such forward contracts are recognized at the time the
underlying hedged transaction is completed or recognized in earnings.  At March
31, 1999, the Company had contracts to exchange foreign currencies, principally
the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Great Britain pound in the following
notional amounts:

                Forward sale contracts                $20,745
                Forward purchase contracts               $275

     No significant gain or loss was inherent in such contracts at March 31,
1999.


Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments

     The fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents is equal to their
carrying value at March 31, 1999 and 1998.  The fair value of the Company's
long-term debt approximates carrying value.  The fair value of the Company's
other monetary assets and liabilities approximate carrying value due to the
relatively short-term nature of these items.


Note 4 - Inventories

     Inventories are summarized as follows:

</TABLE>

     The 6.50% notes maturing on June 1, 2003 and the 6.85% notes maturing on
June 1, 2008 (collectively, the "Notes") were issued by Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A.,
Inc., a subsidiary of THC ("TH USA"), and guaranteed by THC.  The indenture
under which the Notes were issued contains covenants that, among other things,
restrict the ability of subsidiaries of THC to incur additional indebtedness,
restrict the ability of THC and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness secured
by liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions and restrict the ability
of THC and TH USA to engage in mergers or consolidations.

     The term and revolving credit facilities (the "Credit Facilities"), which
are guaranteed by THC, consist of an unsecured $250,000 TH USA five-year
revolving credit facility, of which up to $150,000 may be used for direct
borrowings, and an unsecured $200,000 five-year term credit facility which was
borrowed by TH USA in connection with the Acquisition.  The revolving credit
facility will be available for letters of credit, working capital and other
general corporate purposes.  As of March 31, 1999, $122,000 of the available
borrowings had been used to open letters of credit.  The Credit Facilities
replaced the Company's secured revolving credit agreement which had been in
place since April 1, 1996.

                                     F-12
<PAGE>

     Borrowings under the term loan facility are repayable in quarterly
installments as follows:  $40,000 in the 12-month period ending March 31, 2000;
$50,000 in each of the next two succeeding 12-month periods; and $60,000 in the
next succeeding 12-month period.

     The Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other
things, restrict the ability of subsidiaries of THC to dispose of assets, incur
additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, pay dividends or make other
payments in respect of capital stock, make investments, loans and advances,
engage in transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback
transactions, engage in mergers or consolidations or change the businesses
conducted by them.  The Credit Facilities also restrict the ability of THC to
create liens on assets or enter into sale and leaseback transactions.  Under the
Credit Facilities, subsidiaries of THC may not pay dividends or make other
payments in respect of capital stock to THC that in the aggregate exceed 33% of
the Company's cumulative consolidated net income, commencing with the fiscal
year ended March 31, 1998, less certain deductions.  In addition, under the
Credit Facilities, THC and TH USA are required to comply with and maintain
specified financial ratios and tests (based on the Company's consolidated
financial results), including, without limitation, an interest expense coverage
ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth test.

     The Company was in compliance with all covenants in respect of the Notes
and the Credit Facilities as of March 31, 1999.

     In connection with the purchase of real estate, Tommy Hilfiger (Eastern
Hemisphere) Limited, a subsidiary of THC ("THEH"), obtained a ten-year, $2,746
mortgage.  The debt, payable in equal quarterly installments through August
2003, was repaid in its entirety during fiscal 1998.

Legal matters

     Saipan Litigation.  On January 13, 1999, two actions were filed against the
     -----------------
Company and other garment manufacturers and retailers asserting claims that
garment factories located on the island of Saipan, which allegedly supply
product to the Company and other co-defendants, engage in unlawful practices
relating to the recruitment and employment of foreign workers.  One action,
brought in San Francisco Superior Court (the "State Action"), was filed by a
union and three public interest groups alleging unfair competition and false
advertising by the Company and others.  It seeks equitable relief, restitution
and disgorgement of profits relating to the allegedly wrongful conduct, as well
as interest and an award of fees to the plaintiffs' attorneys.  The other, an
action seeking class action status filed in federal court for the Central
District of California  (the "Federal Action"), was brought on behalf of an
alleged class consisting of the Saipanese factory workers.  The defendants
include both companies selling goods purchased from factories located on the
island of Saipan and the factories themselves.  This complaint alleges claims
under RICO, the Alien Tort Claims Act, federal anti-peonage and indentured
servitude statutes and state and international law.  It seeks equitable relief
and damages, including treble and punitive damages, interest and an award of
fees to the plaintiffs' attorneys.

     In addition, the same law firm that filed the State Action and the Federal
Action has filed an action seeking class action status in the Federal Court in
Saipan.  This action is brought on behalf of Saipanese garment factory workers
against the Saipanese factories and alleges violation of federal and Saipanese
wage and employment laws.  The Company is not a defendant in this action.

     In the State Action, all defendants, including the Company, have filed a
demurrer challenging the legal sufficiency of the complaint.  In the Federal
Action, all defendants, including the Company, have filed a motion to transfer
venue and a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.  The
plaintiffs have not yet filed their opposition to these motions.

     Shareholder Derivative Litigation.  On February 2, 1998, February 12, 1998
     ---------------------------------
and February 17, 1998, three alleged holders of Ordinary Shares filed purported
derivative actions in New York State court on behalf of the Company against the
members of the Board of Directors.  The actions were later consolidated and an
amended complaint was served on May 29, 1998.  The amended complaint alleged
that the Board's approval of the Acquisition constituted a breach of fiduciary
duty and corporate waste, and sought equitable relief and damages in favor of
the Company, and an award of fees to the plaintiffs' attorneys.  On June 15,
1998, the Company and its directors moved to dismiss the consolidated action on
several grounds.   On December 9, 1998, the Court dismissed the action, ruling
that the British Virgin Islands, the Company's place of incorporation, is the
appropriate forum in which to litigate these derivative claims.  In January
1999, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with respect to the Court's
ruling.

  The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time involved in routine
legal matters incidental to their businesses.  In the opinion of the Company's
management, based on advice of

                                     F-14

counsel, the resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on its
financial position or its results of operations.

     The deferred tax liability of $250,344 reflects deferred taxes associated
with acquired identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill. The increase
in the accrued marketing costs from March 31, 1998 to March 31, 1999 is
primarily due to the inclusion of the balances of the Acquired Companies.

     THC is not taxed on income in the BVI, where it is incorporated. THC's
subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

     Provision has not been made for taxes on undistributed non-BVI earnings of
$267,062 at March 31, 1999, as those earnings will continue to be reinvested. As
a result of various tax planning strategies available to the Company, it is not
practical to estimate the amount of tax, if any, that might be payable on the
eventual remittance of such earnings.


Note 10 - Segment Reporting

     The Company has three reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing.
The Company's reportable segments are business units that offer different
products and services or similar products through different distribution
channels. The Wholesale segment consists of the design and sourcing of men's
sportswear and jeanswear, women's casualwear and jeanswear and childrenswear for
wholesale distribution. The Retail segment reflects the operations of the
Company's outlet, specialty and flagship stores. The Licensing segment consists
of the operations of licensing the Company's trademarks for specified products
in specified geographic areas. The Company evaluates performance and allocates
resources based on segment profits. The accounting policies of the reportable
segments are the same as those described in Note 1, "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies". Segment profits are comprised of segment net revenue less
cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses. Excluded
from segment profits, however, are the vast majority of executive compensation,
marketing, brand image marketing costs associated with its flagship stores,
amortization of intangibles including goodwill, special charges and interest
costs. Financial information for the Company's reportable segments is as
follows:

Note 11 - Related Parties

     See related disclosures in Note 15 - Acquisition of Womenswear, Jeanswear
and Canadian Licensees.

     Effective February 1, 1997, the Company entered into the Pepe European
License (as defined in Note 15) with Pepe Jeans London Corporation ("PJLC")
which provides for the distribution of the Company's products throughout the
European market. PJLC subsequently assigned this license to a subsidiary. Under
this agreement, the licensee pays Tommy Hilfiger Licensing, Inc., a subsidiary
of THC ("THLI"), a royalty based on a percentage of the value of licensed
products sold by the licensee. Except with the approval of THLI, all products
sold by or through the licensee must be purchased through THEH or TH USA
pursuant to buying agency agreements. Under these agreements, THEH and TH USA
are paid a buying agency commission based on a percentage of the cost of
products sourced through them. The distribution of products under this
arrangement began in fiscal 1998. Results of operations include $4,748 and
$1,641, for the years ended March 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, of royalties
and commissions under this arrangement.

     Effective June 30, 1996, the Company's joint venture arrangement with Tommy
Hilfiger Japan Co., Ltd. covering the Company's Japanese operations expired.
Effective July 1, 1996, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement
for Japan with Novel-ITC Licensing Limited ("NIL"), a related party. Under the
license agreement, NIL pays THLI a royalty based on a percentage of the value of
licensed products sold by NIL's sublicensee. Except with the approval of THLI,
all products sold by or through NIL or its sublicensee must be purchased through
THEH or TH USA pursuant to buying agency agreements. Under these agreements,
THEH and TH USA are paid a buying agency commission based on a percentage of the
cost of products sourced through them. Pursuant to this new arrangement,
royalties and commissions totaled $3,119, $4,211 and $2,745 in fiscal 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively. Pursuant to the prior arrangement, royalties and
commissions totaled $488 in fiscal 1997.

     Effective October 1, 1995, the Company entered into the Pepe United States
License and the Pepe International License (each as defined in Note 15). Other
assets as of March 31, 1998 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include a note
receivable from an affiliate of the licensees in connection with this
transaction. The note, which was canceled in connection with the Acquisition,
had a face value of $5,000, and had a maturity of September 30, 2000. The note
was recorded at its present value of $4,097 at March 31, 1998. Under this
license arrangement, which terminated as a result of the Acquisition, the
Company received royalties from subsidiaries of PJLC based upon a percentage of
net sales of licensed products. The fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 results of
operations include $1,990, $19,016 and $9,963 of such royalties. In addition, in
connection with this license, a subsidiary of PJLC leased certain space at the
Company's U.S. headquarters, for which rent of $22, $262 and $214 was received
by the Company in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Prior to the
Acquisition, TH USA purchased finished goods in the ordinary course of business
from PJLC and its subsidiaries. Such purchases amounted to $1,004, $8,400 and
$14,100 during the fiscal years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

     TH USA purchases finished goods in the ordinary course of business from
other affiliated companies. Such purchases amounted to $47,734, $14,600 and
$9,852 during the

                                      F-18
<PAGE>

fiscal years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. In addition,
contractors of the Company purchased raw materials in the ordinary course of
business from affiliates of the Company. Such purchases amounted to $15,051,
$5,930 and $5,811 during the fiscal years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The significant increases in 1999 reflect the inclusion of
purchases made by the Acquired Companies.

     Under the Canadian License arrangement (as defined in Note 15), which
terminated as a result of the Acquisition, the Company received a royalty from
the licensee based upon a percentage of net sales of licensed products and a
buying agency commission based on a percentage of the cost of goods sourced on
behalf of the licensee. Results of operations include $399, $3,885 and $2,378
for the years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, for royalties
and commissions earned from this licensee.

     TH USA sells merchandise in the ordinary course of business to a retail
store that is owned by a relative of a director and executive officer of the
Company. Sales to this customer amounted to approximately $732, $476 and $435
during the years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

     In connection with the shareholder derivative litigation described in Note
8 above, the Company has agreed to advance legal fees and other expenses to the
Company's directors. Each director has delivered a written undertaking to repay
the Company in the event that a court ultimately determines that such director
was not entitled to indemnification. An aggregate of approximately $600 was
advanced pursuant to these arrangements in fiscal 1999.

     THEH has two consulting agreements with affiliates. THEH paid fees of
$1,000 in fiscal 1999 and $875 in each of fiscal 1998 and 1997 under such
agreements.

     Under the terms of an agreement with an affiliate, Tommy Hilfiger (HK)
Limited, a subsidiary of THC ("THHK"), reimburses the affiliate for certain
general and administrative expenses incurred by the affiliate on behalf of THHK.
Payments made to the affiliate for the years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997
were $133, $77 and $58, respectively.


Note 12 - Retirement Plans

     The Company maintains employee savings plans for eligible U.S. employees.
The Company's contributions to the plans are discretionary with matching
contributions of up to 50% of employee contributions of up to 5% of employee
compensation. For the years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, the Company
made plan contributions of $1,171, $568 and $345, respectively.

     Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted a supplemental executive
retirement plan which provides certain members of senior management with a
supplemental pension. The supplemental executive retirement plan is an unfunded
plan for purposes of both the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Included in accrued expenses and other
current liabilities is $1,600 and $300 at March 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively,
related to this plan.

     Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted a voluntary deferred
compensation plan which provides certain members of senior management with an
opportunity to defer a portion of base salary or bonus pursuant to the terms of
the plan. The voluntary deferred compensation

                                      F-19
<PAGE>

plan is an unfunded plan for purposes of both the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

Note 13 - Stock Option Plans

     In September 1992, the Company and its subsidiaries adopted stock option
plans (the "Plans") authorizing the issuance of an aggregate of up to 2,970,000
Ordinary Shares to directors, officers and employees of the Company.
Subsequently, through June 1999, a total of 5,750,000 additional Ordinary Shares
of THC were authorized and reserved for issuance to directors, officers and
employees of the Company, under the Plans. In August 1994, the Board of
Directors and shareholders of the Company approved the Tommy Hilfiger
Corporation Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (the "Directors Option
Plan"). Under the Directors Option Plan, directors who are not officers or
employees of the Company are eligible to receive stock option grants. The total
number of Ordinary Shares for which options may be granted under the Directors
Option Plan may not exceed 200,000 Ordinary Shares in the aggregate, subject to
certain adjustments.

     Transactions involving the Plans and the Directors Option Plan are
summarized as follows:

     Options vest over periods ranging from 1-6 years with a maximum term of 10
years. The exercise price of all options granted under the Plans and the
Directors Option Plan is the market price on the dates of grant.

     The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees", and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option
awards. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for stock
options granted in 1999, 1998 and 1997. Had compensation cost been recorded
based upon the fair value at the grant dates as an alternative provided by SFAS
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", the Company's net income and
earnings per share (basic and diluted) would have been reduced by approximately
$8,221 and $.18, respectively, in 1999, $4,824 and $.13, respectively, in 1998
and $2,998 and $.08, respectively, in 1997. These amounts are for disclosure
purposes only and may not be representative of future calculations since the
estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting
period, and additional options may be granted in future years. The fair values
of options granted were estimated at $29.39 in 1999, $21.38 in 1998 and $22.33
in 1997 on the dates of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions for 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively: volatility of 43%, 43% and 40%; risk free interest rate of 5.4%,
6.5% and 6.1%; expected life of 6.0 years, 5.9 years and 5.7 years; and no
future dividends.

Note 15 - Acquisition of Womenswear, Jeanswear and Canadian Licensees

     On May 8, 1998, following the approval by the shareholders of the Company
on May 5, 1998, the Company acquired from related parties Pepe Jeans USA, Inc.,
the Company's United States womenswear and jeanswear licensee ("Pepe USA"), TJ
Far East Limited, Pepe USA's buying agency affiliate, and Tomcan Investments
Inc., the parent corporation of Tommy Hilfiger Canada Inc. ("TH Canada"), the
Company's Canadian licensee (collectively, the "Acquired Companies"), for an
aggregate purchase price of $755,760 in cash plus 9,045,930 Ordinary Shares of
the Company (the "Acquisition"). The cash portion of the purchase price was
funded from a combination of debt financing and cash on hand. The Ordinary
Shares were valued at $46.37 per share, the average closing price for the five
days before and after the announcement of the Acquisition, reduced by a
valuation adjustment of $41,946 to reflect the restriction on the shares.

     At the date of the Acquisition, the licenses between the Acquired Companies
and the Company consisted of: a license with Pepe USA covering jeans and jeans
related apparel and women's and girls' casualwear in the United States (the
"Pepe United States License"); a license with T.H. International N.V., a
subsidiary of PJLC, covering jeans and jeans related apparel and women's and
girls' casualwear worldwide (other than in the United States and certain
specified countries) (the "Pepe International License"); a geographic license
with Tommy Hilfiger Europe B.V., a subsidiary of PJLC, covering men's and boys'
sportswear lines in Europe and certain other countries (the "Pepe European
License"); and a master geographic license for Canada with TH Canada (the
"Canadian License").

     In connection with the Acquisition, the Company acquired the businesses
operated under the Pepe United States License and the Canadian License, the Pepe
International License was canceled and the license arrangements for Europe
previously covered by the Pepe International License were consolidated under the
Pepe European License. Accordingly, the Pepe European License was amended to,
among other things, include in its scope men's, women's and children's jeanswear
and jeans related apparel (including women's and girls' casualwear) and to
increase the minimum sales levels, guaranteed minimum royalties and minimum
advertising payments required thereunder. The Pepe European License was also
amended to provide the Company certain additional rights in connection with any
proposed future transfer of the business conducted under the Pepe European
License. In addition, in connection with the

                                      F-22
<PAGE>

Acquisition, a $5,000 note receivable (see Note 11 - Related Parties) was
canceled in consideration for a capital contribution being made to Pepe USA in
the same amount as the receivable.

     The Acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of the Acquired Companies are
included in the consolidated results of the Company from the date of the
Acquisition. The purchase price has been allocated as follows:

Note 16 - Special Acquisition-Related Charges

     During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company recorded a special
charge for non-recurring expenses of $19,800, before income taxes, related to
the Acquisition. This special charge consists of provisions of $7,000 for the
write-off of the fixed assets and operating leases of the Company's specialty
stores, $7,000 for redundant MIS equipment, furniture, fixtures and other
equipment, $3,800 for severance and other employee costs and $2,000 for the
termination of certain vendor contracts.

     At March 31, 1999, $6,900 of the special charge remains in accrued
liabilities. The balance principally relates to the closure of the specialty
stores and restructuring of the related leases.

all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to
present such data fairly.


Note 19 - Share Split (Unaudited)

     On June 4, 1999, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had
approved and declared a two-for-one split of the Company's Ordinary Shares, par
value $.01 per share (the "Ordinary Shares"). The split will be effected in the
form of a dividend of one Ordinary Share per Ordinary Share issued and
outstanding or held by the Company in its treasury (the "Share Split"), and will
be payable on July 9, 1999 to shareholders of record at the close of business on
June 18, 1999. In connection with the Share Split, the Board of Directors of the
Company also approved an increase in the number of authorized Ordinary Shares to
150,000,000 from 75,000,000.

Certain Employment Agreements

     Subsidiaries of the Company had employment agreements with Messrs. Hilfiger
and Horowitz during fiscal year 1999.

     The employment agreement with Tommy Hilfiger, the Company's Honorary
Chairman of the Board and Principal Designer, provides for his employment as the
designer of all products carrying the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks until his death,
disability or incompetence. Mr. Hilfiger receives an annual base salary of
$900,000, subject to adjustments. If net sales of TH USA and its subsidiaries
are less than $48,333,333 in any year, Mr. Hilfiger's base salary for such year
is reduced by 1.5% of such shortfall, to not less than $500,000. If net sales
are greater than $48,333,333 in any fiscal year, Mr. Hilfiger receives an
additional payment equal to 1.5% of such excess. If Mr. Hilfiger terminates his
employment without the consent of TH USA other than by reason of his death,
disability or incompetence, TH USA will have no further obligations under the
agreement. The employment agreement provides that TH USA and its subsidiaries
cannot enter into any line of business without the consent of Mr. Hilfiger if he
shall reasonably determine that such line of business would be detrimental to
the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks.

     The employment agreement with Mr. Horowitz provides for his employment as
Chief Executive Officer of the Company and TH USA until March 31, 2004. The
agreement provided for an annual base salary in fiscal year 1999 of $540,000.
The base salary is subject to increase each year thereafter by the average
percentage increase for all employees of TH USA.

     Beginning in fiscal 1995, the Company became subject to Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), under which public
companies are not permitted to deduct annual compensation paid to certain
executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 per executive, unless such excess is
paid pursuant to an arrangement based upon performance and approved by
shareholders and provided that the other requirements set forth in Section
162(m) and related regulations are met. Payments required to be made pursuant to
the aforementioned employment agreement with Mr. Hilfiger, which was entered
into prior to the effective date of Section 162(m), are not subject to such
restrictions.

                                       31
<PAGE>

     On August 6, 1998, the Company's Compensation Committee approved and the
Board of Directors adopted, and on November 2, 1998, the shareholders approved,
the renewal of the Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc. Supplemental Executive Incentive
Compensation Plan (the "SEIC Plan"), which was scheduled to terminate on April
1, 1999, for each of the five fiscal years in the period ending March 31, 2004.
The purpose of the SEIC Plan is to provide a significant and flexible economic
opportunity to Mr. Horowitz, Chief Executive Officer and President of the
Company and Chief Executive Officer of TH USA, in an effort to reward his
contribution to the Company and its subsidiaries. The SEIC Plan is administered
by the Company's Compensation Committee and provides for a cash award to Mr.
Horowitz equal to 5 percent of the Company's consolidated earnings before
depreciation, interest on financing of fixed assets, non-operating expenses and
taxes ("operating earnings"). Awards under the plan are calculated and paid
quarterly based on 3.75 percent of operating earnings for the first three fiscal
quarters, with the remaining amount of the bonus (based on the 5 percent rate)
payable at the end of the fiscal year. The amount of the award is reduced by the
amount of any other bonuses paid or payable under any employment or bonus
agreement between the Company or TH USA and Mr. Horowitz. The SEIC Plan does not
contain any cap on the maximum amount of the bonus payable thereunder. The SEIC
Plan bonus payable to Mr. Horowitz in respect of fiscal year 1999 was
$15,374,000. While the Company believes that compensation payable pursuant to
the SEIC Plan will be deductible for federal income tax purposes pursuant to
Section 162(m), there can be no assurance in this regard.

     The employment agreements with Messrs. Hilfiger and Horowitz also provide
that such executives are eligible to receive additional annual bonuses at the
discretion of TH USA's Compensation Committee if the TH USA Compensation
Committee determines that certain performance levels established by the
Company's Compensation Committee have been satisfied. If, however, compensation
is awarded based on an arrangement that does not satisfy the requirements of
Section 162(m), the Company would not be allowed to deduct for tax purposes any
payments in excess of the $1,000,000 limitation. The Compensation Committee
approved discretionary bonuses of $3,500,000 and $4,500,000 for Mr. Hilfiger in
fiscal years 1998 and 1997, respectively. The full amount of the fiscal year
1998 bonus, and $3,500,000 of the fiscal year 1997 bonus, was granted on a
deferred basis as described below (the "Deferred Bonuses").

     The Deferred Bonuses (and any interest accrued thereon) will be paid in
annual installments on the last day of each fiscal year of the Company in the
largest possible amounts that can be paid, after taking into account any base
salary and other compensation in that fiscal year which would be counted for
purposes of Section 162(m), and still be fully deductible under such
regulations. The unpaid portion of the Deferred Bonuses will accrue interest at
a rate equal to TH USA's bank borrowing rate. While the Company believes that
such Deferred Bonus payments will be deductible for federal income tax purposes
pursuant to Section 162(m), there can be no assurance in this regard.

Stock Option Plans

Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc. and Tommy Hilfiger (Eastern Hemisphere) Limited 1992
Stock Incentive Plans

     In September 1992, the Company and its subsidiaries adopted stock options
plans (collectively, the "Plans") authorizing the issuance of an aggregate of up
to 2,970,000 Ordinary Shares to directors, officers and employees of the Company
and its subsidiaries. Subsequently, through June 1999, 5,750,000 additional
Ordinary Shares were authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plans. The
number of Ordinary Shares subject to the Plans is subject to certain adjustments
as provided in the Plans.

     Currently, over half of the full-time employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries are participants in the Plans. Messrs. Hilfiger, Horowitz, Chou,
Stroll and Chao are not eligible for grants under the Plans.

     The Plan for employees of TH USA and its subsidiaries is administered by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of TH USA and the Plan for
employees of the Company's Far East subsidiaries is administered by the
Company's Compensation Committee (collectively, the "Compensation Committees").
Under the Plans, awards may include stock options, stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock. An option or right granted under the Plans must have an
exercise price of not less than market value at the date of grant.

     Options may be exercisable at such times, in such amounts, in accordance
with such terms and conditions, and subject to such restrictions as are set
forth in the option agreement evidencing the grant of such options. In addition,
the grants may provide for acceleration or immediate vesting in the event of a
change of control of the Company or its subsidiaries.


Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan

     In August 1994, the Board of Directors and shareholders of the Company
approved the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan
(the "Directors Option Plan"). Options for up to 200,000 Ordinary Shares,
subject to certain adjustments, may be granted under the Directors Option Plan.
Each director who is not an officer or employee of the Company or any subsidiary
of the Company (a "Non-Employee Director") receives an initial stock option to
purchase 10,000 Ordinary Shares, and subsequent annual grants of options to
purchase 1,000 Ordinary Shares, in each case at a price equal to the fair market
value at the time of the grant of the Ordinary Shares subject to such stock
option.

     The Directors Option Plan is administered by the Company's Compensation
Committee. However, grants of stock options to participants under the Plan and
the amount, nature and timing of the grants are not subject to the determination
of the Committee.

     The term of each stock option granted under the Directors Option Plan is 10
years unless earlier terminated by termination of the director status of a Non-
Employee Director, and the stock options are exercisable in equal installments
over five years from the date of grant.

Director Compensation

     Directors who are officers or employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries receive no additional compensation for their service on the Board
and its Committees. All Non-Employee Directors receive the following retainers:
$40,000 per annum for members of the Board; $5,000 per annum for members of
standing committees; and $3,000 per annum for Chairmen of standing committees.
The Non-Employee Directors also receive $2,000 for attendance at each meeting of
the Board or a Committee. In addition, the Non-Employee Directors participate in
the Directors Option Plan. See "Stock Option Plans."

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     Certain relationships and transactions between the Company and certain
directors and officers of the Company and certain of their affiliates are
described below.


The Acquisition

     On January 26, 1998, Pepe USA entered into a share purchase agreement with
Lawvest Holdings Inc. ("Lawvest"), a company in which Mr. Stroll and his
descendants have a 100% beneficial ownership interest, to acquire Tomcan, the
parent corporation of TH Canada, the Company's Canadian licensee. Lawvest's sole
shareholder executed a guarantee of Lawvest's indemnification obligations under
this agreement. On January 31, 1998, the Company entered into a stock purchase
agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") with PJLC to acquire Pepe USA, the
Company's United States womenswear and jeanswear licensee, and Pepe Far East,
Pepe USA's buying agency affiliate. Also on January 31, 1998, AIHL executed a
guarantee of the performance by PJLC of its obligations under the Stock Purchase
Agreement. On May 8, 1998, following the approval by the shareholders of the
Company on May 5, 1998, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries,
acquired Pepe USA and Pepe Far East from PJLC for an aggregate purchase price of
$755,760,000 in cash plus 9,045,930 Ordinary Shares of the Company (the
"Purchase Price Shares"). Immediately following this transaction, Pepe USA
acquired from Lawvest all of the outstanding shares of Tomcan with funds
provided by PJLC using proceeds from the cash consideration paid to it in the
Acquisition.

     At the time of the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company
entered into a lock-up agreement (the "Lock-Up Agreement") with PJLC,
Blackwatch, AIHL, Anasta, Sportswear, Westleigh, Flair, Mr. Hilfiger and Mr.
Horowitz (collectively, the "PJLC Affiliates"), prohibiting the transfer of the
Purchase Price Shares for two years from the date of the Acquisition, with
additional restrictions during the following three years on transfers of the
shares as a block, subject in each case to certain exceptions. Under the Lock-Up
Agreement, the two-year prohibition on transfers may only be amended with the
approval of a majority of the votes cast by disinterested holders of Ordinary
Shares at a meeting of the Company's shareholders.

     At the time of the closing of the Acquisition, the Company entered into a
registration rights agreement with the PJLC Affiliates under which the PJLC
Affiliates, along with their successors and permitted transferees under the
Lock-Up Agreement, will have the right to require the Company to register sales
of the Purchase Price Shares following the second anniversary of the
Acquisition. At that time, Messrs. Chou and Stroll also entered into a non-
competition agreement with the Company restricting their ability to compete in
the United States or Canada with the Pepe USA businesses for four years
following the Acquisition.

     At the date of the Acquisition, the licenses between the Acquired Companies
and the Company consisted of: a license with Pepe USA covering jeans and jeans
related apparel and women's and girls' casualwear in the United States (the
"Pepe United States License"); a license with T.H. International N.V., a
subsidiary of PJLC, covering jeans and jeans related apparel and women's and
girls' casualwear worldwide (other than in the United States and certain
specified

                                       37
<PAGE>

countries) (the "Pepe International License"); a geographic license with Tommy
Hilfiger Europe B.V., a subsidiary of PJLC, covering men's and boys' sportswear
lines in Europe and certain other countries (the "Pepe European License"); and a
master geographic license for Canada with TH Canada (the "Canadian License").

     In connection with the Acquisition, the Company acquired the businesses
operated under the Pepe United States License and the Canadian License, the Pepe
International License was canceled and the license arrangements for Europe
previously covered by the Pepe International License were consolidated under the
Pepe European License. Accordingly, the Pepe European License was amended to,
among other things, include in its scope men's, women's and children's jeanswear
and jeans related apparel (including women's and girls' casualwear) and to
increase the minimum sales levels, guaranteed minimum royalties and minimum
advertising payments required thereunder. The Pepe European License was also
amended to provide the Company certain additional rights in connection with any
proposed future transfer of the business conducted under the Pepe European
License. In addition, in connection with the Acquisition, a $5,000,000 note
receivable from AIHL was canceled in consideration for a capital contribution
being made to Pepe USA in the same amount as the receivable.


Other Relationships and Transactions

     Effective February 1, 1997, the Company entered into the Pepe European
License with PJLC. PJLC subsequently assigned the license to a subsidiary, Tommy
Hilfiger Europe B.V. Under this agreement, the licensee pays THLI a royalty
based on a percentage of the value of licensed products sold by the licensee.
Except with the approval of THLI, all products sold by or through the licensee
must be purchased through THEH or TH USA pursuant to buying agency agreements.
Under these agreements, THEH and TH USA are paid a buying agency commission
based on a percentage of the cost of products sourced through them. Results of
operations include $4,748,000, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999, of
royalties and commissions under this arrangement. In addition, in connection
with this license, a subsidiary of the licensee leases certain space at the
Company's New Bond Street flagship store in London for a rent of (Pounds)60,000
per annum.

     Effective July 1, 1996, the Company entered into an exclusive license
agreement for Japan with Novel-ITC Licensing Limited ("NIL"), a company jointly
controlled by Itochu Corporation, which was the 51% owner of TH Japan, and Novel
Enterprises. Mr. Stroll indirectly owns a 3.5% equity interest in NIL. Under the
license agreement, NIL pays THLI a royalty based on a percentage of the value of
licensed products sold by THMJ Incorporated ("THMJ"), NIL's sublicensee. Novel
Enterprises and its affiliates and Messrs. Stroll, Hilfiger and Horowitz
indirectly own equity interests of 15.2%, 15.2%, 9.7% and 3.2%, respectively, in
THMJ. Except with the approval of THLI, all products sold by or through NIL or
THMJ must be purchased through THEH or TH USA pursuant to buying agency
agreements. Under these agreements, THEH and TH USA are paid a buying agency
commission based on a percentage of the cost of products sourced through them.
Pursuant to this arrangement, royalties and commissions totaled $3,119,000
during fiscal 1999.

     Prior to the Acquisition in fiscal 1999, (i) royalties under the Pepe
United States License and the Pepe International License totaled $1,990,000,
(ii) royalties and commissions with respect to the Canadian License totaled
$399,000 and (iii) TH USA purchased $1,004,000 of finished goods in the ordinary
course of business from subsidiaries of PJLC.

                                       38
<PAGE>

     TH USA purchases finished goods in the ordinary course of business from
affiliates of Novel Enterprises. Such purchases amounted to $47,734,000 during
the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999. In addition, contractors of the Company
purchase raw materials in the ordinary course of business from affiliates of
Novel Enterprises pursuant to the Company's designation of such sources as
acceptable suppliers. Such purchases amounted to $15,051,000 during the fiscal
year ended March 31, 1999.

     The Company sells merchandise in the ordinary course of business to a
retail store that is owned by Mr. Hilfiger's sister. Sales to this customer
amounted to approximately $732,000 during fiscal 1999.

     In April 1999, TH USA sold to Mr. Hilfiger a whole life insurance policy
under which he is the named insured for its cash surrender value of $290,000.

     In connection with the shareholder derivative litigation described in Item
3 above, the Company has agreed to advance legal fees and other expenses to the
Company's directors. Each director has delivered a written undertaking to repay
the Company in the event that a court ultimately determines that such director
was not entitled to indemnification. An aggregate of approximately $600,000 was
advanced pursuant to these arrangements in fiscal 1999.

     THEH has a consulting agreement with Fasco International, an affiliate of
Messrs. Chou and Stroll. The fees under this agreement totaled $500,000 during
fiscal 1999.

     THEH has a consulting agreement with an affiliate of Mr. Stroll. THEH paid
fees of $500,000 in fiscal 1999 to such affiliate.

     Under the terms of an agreement with Novel Enterprises, THHK reimburses
Novel Enterprises for certain general and administrative expenses incurred by it
on behalf of THHK. Payments made to Novel Enterprises for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1999 were $133,000.

     The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors monitors and approves
transactions between the Company and its affiliates to seek to provide that such
transactions are on terms which are no less favorable as a whole to the Company
than could be obtained from unaffiliated parties. The Audit Committee is
comprised of independent Non-Employee Directors.

          treasury shares     Shares in the Company that were previously issued
                              but were repurchased, redeemed or otherwise

2.   "Written" or any term of like import includes words typewritten, printed,
     painted, engraved, lithographed, photographed or represented or reproduced
     by any mode of  reproducing words in a visible form, including telex,
     facsimile, telegram, cable or other form of writing produced by electronic
     communication.

3.   Save as aforesaid any words or expressions defined in the Act shall bear
     the same meaning in these Articles.

4.   Whenever the singular or plural number, or the masculine, feminine or
     neuter gender is used in these Articles, it shall equally, where the
     context admits, include the others.

5.   A reference in these Articles to voting in relation to shares shall be
     construed as a reference to voting by members holding the shares except
     that it is the votes allocated to the shares that shall be counted and not
     the number of members who actually voted and a reference to shares being
     present at a meeting shall be given a corresponding construction.

6.   A reference to money in these Articles is, unless otherwise stated, a
     reference to the currency in which shares in the Company shall be issued
     according to the provisions of the Memorandum.

                               REGISTERED SHARES

7.   Every member holding registered shares in the Company shall be entitled to
     a certificate signed by a director or officer of the Company and under the
     Seal specifying the share or shares held by him and the signature of the
     director or officer and the Seal may be facsimiles.

8.   Any member receiving a share certificate for registered shares shall
     indemnify and hold the Company and its directors and officers harmless from
     any loss or liability which it or they may incur by reason of any wrongful
     or fraudulent use or representation made by any person by virtue of the
     possession thereof. If a share certificate for registered shares is worn
     out or lost it may be renewed on production of the worn out certificate or
     on satisfactory proof of its loss together with such indemnity as may be
     required by a resolution of directors.

9.   If several persons are registered as joint holders of any shares, any one
     of such persons may give an effectual

                                       4
<PAGE>

     receipt for any dividend payable in respect of such shares.

                SHARES, AUTHORIZED CAPITAL, CAPITAL AND SURPLUS

10.  Subject to the provisions of these Articles and any resolution of members,
     the unissued shares of the Company shall be at the disposal of the
     directors who may, without limiting or affecting any rights previously
     conferred on the holders of any existing shares or class or series of
     shares, offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of shares to
     such persons, at such times and upon such terms and conditions as the
     Company may by resolution of directors determine.

11.  No share in the Company may be issued until the consideration in respect
     thereof is fully paid, and when issued the share is for all purposes fully
     paid and non-assessable save that a share issued for a promissory note or
     other written obligation for payment of a debt may be issued subject to
     forfeiture in the manner prescribed in these Articles.

12.  Shares in the Company shall be issued for money, services rendered,
     personal property, an estate in real property, a promissory note or other
     binding obligation to contribute money or property or any combination of
     the foregoing as shall be determined by a resolution of directors.

13.  Shares in the Company may be issued for such amount of consideration as the
     directors may from time to time by resolution of directors determine,
     except that in the case of shares with par value, the amount  shall not be
     less than the par value, and in the absence of fraud the decision of the
     directors as to the value of the consideration received by the Company in
     respect of the issue  is conclusive  unless a question of law is involved.
     The consideration in respect of the shares constitutes capital to the
     extent of the par value and the excess constitutes surplus.

14.  A share issued by the Company upon conversion of, or in exchange for,
     another share or a debt obligation or other security in the Company, shall
     be treated for all purposes as having been issued for money equal to the
     consideration received or deemed to have been received by the Company in
     respect of the other share, debt obligation or security.

15.  Treasury shares may be disposed of by the Company on such terms and
     conditions (not otherwise inconsistent with these Articles) as the Company
     may by resolution of directors determine.

16.  The Company may issue fractions of a share and a fractional share shall
     have the same corresponding

                                       5
<PAGE>

     fractional liabilities, limitations, preferences, privileges,
     qualifications, restrictions, rights and other attributes of a whole share
     of the same class or series of shares.

17.  Upon the issue by the Company of a share without par value, if an amount is
     stated in the Memorandum to be authorized capital represented by such
     shares then each share shall be issued for no less than the appropriate
     proportion of such amount which shall constitute capital, otherwise the
     consideration in respect of the share constitutes capital to the extent
     designated by the directors and the excess constitutes surplus, except that
     the directors must designate as capital an amount of the consideration that
     is at least equal to the amount that the share is entitled to as a
     preference, if any, in the assets of the Company upon liquidation of the
     Company.

18.  The Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire and hold its own
     shares but only out of surplus or in exchange for newly issued shares of
     equal value.

19.  Subject to provisions to the contrary in

     (a)  the Memorandum or these Articles;

     (b)  the designations, powers, preferences, rights, qualifications,
          limitations and restrictions with which the shares were issued; or

     (c)  the subscription agreement for the issue of the shares,

     the Company may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own shares
     without the consent of members whose shares are to be purchased, redeemed
     or otherwise acquired.

20.  No purchase, redemption or other acquisition of shares shall be made unless
     the directors determine that immediately after the purchase, redemption or
     other acquisition the Company will be able to satisfy its liabilities as
     they become due in the ordinary course of its business and the realizable
     value of the assets of the Company will not be less than the sum of its
     total liabilities, other than deferred taxes, as shown in the books of
     account, and its capital and, in the absence of fraud, the decision of the
     directors as to the realizable value of the assets of the Company is
     conclusive, unless a question of law is involved.

21.  A determination by the directors under the preceding Regulation  is not
     required where shares are purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired

                                       6
<PAGE>

     (a)  pursuant  to  a  right  of  a member to have his shares redeemed
          or to have his shares exchanged for money or other property of the
          Company;

     (b)  by virtue of a transfer of capital pursuant to Regulation 49;

     (c)  by virtue of the provisions of Section 83 of the  Act; or

     (d)  pursuant to an order of the Court.

22.  Shares that the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires pursuant
     to the preceding Regulation may be cancelled or held as treasury shares
     except to the extent that such shares are in excess of 80 percent of the
     issued shares of the Company in which case they shall be cancelled but they
     shall be available for reissue.

23.  Where shares in the Company are held by the Company as treasury shares or
     are held by another company of which the Company holds, directly or
     indirectly, shares having more than 50 percent of the votes in the election
     of directors of the other company, such shares of the Company are not
     entitled to vote or to have dividends paid thereon and shall not be treated
     as outstanding for any purpose except for purposes of determining the
     capital of the Company.

24.  The Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its shares at a price
     lower than the fair value if permitted by, and then only in accordance
     with, the terms of

     (a)  the Memorandum or these Articles; or

     (b)  a written agreement for the subscription for the shares to be
          purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired.

25.  The Company may by a resolution of directors include in the computation of
     surplus for any purpose the unrealized appreciation of the assets of the
     Company, and, in the absence of fraud, the decision of the directors as to
     the value of the assets is conclusive, unless a question of law is
     involved.

                  MORTGAGES AND CHARGES OF REGISTERED SHARES

26.  Members may mortgage or charge their registered shares in the Company and
     upon satisfactory evidence thereof the Company shall give effect to the
     terms of any valid mortgage or charge except insofar as it may conflict
     with any requirements herein contained for consent to the transfer of
     shares.


27.  In the case of the mortgage or charge of registered shares there may be
     entered in the share register of the

                                       7
<PAGE>

     Company at the request of the registered holder of such shares

     (a)  a statement that the shares are mortgaged or charged;

     (b)  the name of the mortgagee or chargee; and

     (c)  the date on which the aforesaid particulars are entered in the
          share register.

28.  particulars of a mortgage or charge are registered, such particulars shall
     be cancelled

     (a) with the consent of the named mortgagee or anyone
         authorized to act on his behalf; or

     (b) upon evidence satisfactory to the directors of the discharge of
         the liability secured by the mortgage or charge and the issue of such
              indemnities as the directors shall consider necessary or
              desirable.

29.  Whilst particulars of a mortgage or charge are registered, no transfer of
     any share comprised therein shall be effected without the written consent
     of the named mortgagee or chargee or anyone authorized to act on his
     behalf.

                                  FORFEITURE

30.  When shares issued for a promissory note or other written obligation for
     payment of a debt have been issued subject to forfeiture, the following
     provisions shall apply.

31.  Written notice specifying a date for payment to be made and the shares in
     respect of which payment is to be made shall be served on the member who
     defaults in making payment pursuant to a promissory note or other written
     obligations to pay a debt.

32.  The written notice specifying a date for payment shall

     (a) name a further date not earlier than the expiration of 14 days
         from the date of service of the notice on or before which payment
         required by the notice is to be made; and

     (b) contain a statement that in the event of non-payment at or before
         the time named in the notice the shares, or any of them, in respect of
         which payment is not made will be liable to be forfeited.

33.  Where a written notice has been issued and the requirements have not been
     complied with within the prescribed time, the directors may at any time
     before tender of payment forfeit and cancel the shares to which the notice
     relates.

                                       8
<PAGE>

34.  The Company is under no obligation to refund any moneys to the member whose
     shares have been forfeited and cancelled pursuant to these provisions.
     Upon forfeiture and cancellation of the shares the member is discharged
     from any further obligation to the Company with respect to the shares
     forfeited and cancelled.

                                     LIEN

35.  The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share
     issued for a promissory note or for any other binding obligation to
     contribute money or property or any combination thereof to the Company, and
     the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every share
     standing registered in the name of a member, whether singly or jointly with
     any other person or persons, for all the debts and liabilities of such
     member or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been
     incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any
     person other than such member, and whether the time for the payment or
     discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and
     notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such member
     or his estate and any other person, whether a member of the Company or not.
     The Company's lien on a share shall extend to all dividends payable
     thereon.  The directors may at any time either generally, or in any
     particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any share to be
     wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Regulation.

36.  In the absence of express provisions regarding sale in the promissory note
     or other binding obligation to contribute money or property, the Company
     may sell, in such manner as the directors may by resolution of directors
     determine, any share on which the Company has a  lien, but no sale shall be
     made unless some sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently
     payable nor until the expiration of twenty-one days after a notice in
     writing, stating and demanding payment of the sum presently payable and
     giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment, has been
     served on the holder for the time being of the share.

37.  The net proceeds of the sale by the Company of any shares on which it has a
     lien shall be applied in or towards payment of discharge of the promissory
     note or other binding obligation to contribute money or property or any
     combination thereof in respect of which the lien exists so far as the same
     is presently payable and any residue shall (subject to a like lien for
     debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the share prior
     to the sale) be paid to the holder of the share immediately before such
     sale.  For giving effect to any such sale the directors may authorize some
     person to transfer the share sold to the purchaser thereof.  The purchaser
     shall be

                                       9
<PAGE>

     registered as the holder of the share and he shall not be bound to see to
     the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the share be
     affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference
     to the sale.

                              TRANSFER OF SHARES

38.  Subject to any limitations in the Memorandum, registered shares in the
     Company may be transferred by a written instrument of transfer signed by
     the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee, but
     in the absence of such written instrument of transfer the directors may
     accept such evidence of a transfer of shares as they consider appropriate.

39.  The Company shall not be required to treat a transferee of a registered
     share in the Company as a member until the transferee's name has been
     entered in the share register.

40.  Subject to any limitations in the Memorandum, the Company must on the
     application of the transferor or transferee of a registered share in the
     Company enter in the share register the name of the transferee of the share
     save that the registration of transfers may be suspended and the share
     register closed at such times and for such periods as the Company may from
     time to time by resolution of directors determine provided always that such
     registration shall not be suspended and the share register closed for more
     than 60 days in any period of 12 months.

                            TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

4l.  The executor or administrator of a deceased member, the guardian of an
     incompetent member or the trustee of a bankrupt member shall be the only
     person recognized by the Company as having any title to his share but they
     shall not be entitled to exercise any rights as a member of the Company
     until they have proceeded as set forth in the next following three
     Regulations.

42.  The production to the Company of any document which is evidence of probate
     of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, or confirmation as
     executor, of a deceased member or of the appointment of a guardian of an
     incompetent member or the trustee of a bankrupt member shall be accepted by
     the Company even if the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt member is
     domiciled outside the British Virgin Islands if the document evidencing the
     grant of probate or letters of administration, confirmation as executor,
     appointment as guardian or trustee in bankruptcy is issued by a foreign
     court which had competent jurisdiction in the matter. For the purpose of
     establishing whether or not a foreign court had competent jurisdiction in
     such a matter the

                                      10
<PAGE>

     directors may obtain appropriate legal advice. The directors may also
     require an indemnity to be given by the executor, administrator, guardian
     or trustee in bankruptcy.

43.  Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a share or
     shares in consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any
     member may be registered as a member upon such evidence being produced as
     may reasonably be required by the directors.  An application by any such
     person to be registered as a member shall for all purposes be deemed to be
     a transfer of shares of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt member and
     the directors shall treat it as such.

44.  Any person who has become entitled to a share or shares in consequence of
     the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any member may, instead of being
     registered himself, request in writing that some person to be named by him
     be registered as the transferee of such share or shares and such request
     shall likewise be treated as if it were a transfer.

45.  What amounts to incompetence on the part of a person is a matter to be
     determined by the court having regard to all the relevant evidence and the
     circumstances of the case.

            REDUCTION OR INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED CAPITAL OR CAPITAL

46.  The Company may by a resolution of directors amend the Memorandum to
     increase or reduce its authorized capital and in connection therewith the
     Company may in respect of any unissued shares increase or reduce the number
     of such shares, increase or reduce the par value of any such shares or
     effect any combination of the foregoing.

47.  The Company may amend the Memorandum to

     (a)  divide the shares, including issued shares, of a  class or series
          into a larger number of shares of the same class or series; or

     (b)  combine the shares, including issued shares, of a class or series
          into a smaller number of shares of the same class or series,

          provided, however, that where shares are divided or combined under (a)
          or (b) of this Regulation, the aggregate par value of the new shares
          must be equal to the aggregate par value of the original shares.

48.  The capital of the Company may by a resolution of directors be increased by
     transferring an amount of the surplus of the Company to capital.

49.  Subject to the provisions of the two next succeeding Regulations, the
     capital of the Company may by resolution

                                      11
<PAGE>

     of directors be reduced by transferring an amount of the capital of the
     Company to surplus.

50.  No reduction of capital shall be effected that reduces the capital of the
     Company to an amount that immediately after the reduction is less than the
     aggregate par value of all outstanding shares with par value and all shares
     with par value held by the Company as treasury shares and the aggregate of
     the amounts designated as capital of all outstanding shares without par
     value and all shares without par value held by the Company as treasury
     shares that are entitled to a preference, if any, in the assets of the
     Company upon liquidation of the Company.

51.  No reduction of capital shall be effected unless the directors determine
     that immediately after the reduction the Company will be able to satisfy
     its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of its business
     and that the realizable assets of the Company will not be less than its
     total liabilities, other than deferred taxes, as shown   in the books of
     the Company and its remaining capital, and, in the absence of fraud, the
     decision of the directors as to the realizable value of the assets of the
     Company is conclusive, unless a question of law is involved.

                       MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF MEMBERS

52.  The directors of the Company shall convene an annual meeting of the members
     of the Company for the election of directors and such other matters as the
     directors of the Company shall propose for consideration.  In addition, the
     directors of the Company may convene such other meetings of the members of
     the Company at such times as the directors shall consider necessary or
     desirable.  Any meeting of the members may be held at such times and in
     such manner within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the directors
     may determine.

53.  Upon the written request of members holding 50 percent or more of the
     outstanding voting shares in the Company the directors shall convene a
     meeting of members.

54.  The directors shall give not less than ten days' notice of meetings of
     members to those persons whose names on the date the notice is given appear
     as members in the share register of the Company and are entitled to vote at
     the meeting.

55.  The directors may fix the date notice is given of a meeting of members as
     the record date for determining those shares that are entitled to vote at
     the meeting.

56.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Act a meeting of
     members may not be called on less than ten days' notice.

                                      12
<PAGE>

57.  The inadvertent failure of the directors to give notice of a meeting to a
     member, or the fact that a member has not received notice, does not
     invalidate the meeting.

58.  A member may be represented at a meeting of members by a proxy who may
     speak and vote on behalf of the member.

59.  The instrument appointing a proxy shall be produced at the place appointed
     for the meeting before the time for holding the meeting at which the person
     named in such instrument proposes to vote.

60.  An instrument appointing a proxy shall be in substantially the following
     form or such other form as the Chairman of the meeting shall accept as
     properly evidencing the wishes of the member appointing the proxy.

                               (Name of Company)

          I/We                            being a member of the above

any adjournment thereof.

          member;

     (b)  if only one of the joint owners is present in person or by proxy he
          may vote on behalf of all joint owners, and

     (c)  if two or more of the joint owners are present in person or by proxy

     meeting, there are present in person or by proxy not less than 50 percent
     of the votes of the shares or class or series of shares entitled to vote on

                                      13
<PAGE>

     resolutions of members to be considered at the meeting.  If a quorum be
     present, notwithstanding the fact that such quorum may be represented by
     only one person then such person may resolve any matter and a certificate
     signed by such person accompanied where such person be a proxy by a copy of
     the proxy form shall constitute a valid resolution of members.

64.  If within two hours from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not
     present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of members, shall be
     dissolved; in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the next business
     day at the same time and place or to such other time and place as the
     directors may determine, and if at the adjourned meeting there are present

     the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but otherwise the
     meeting shall be dissolved.

65.  At every meeting of members, the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall
     preside as chairman of the meeting.  If there is no Chairman of the Board
     of Directors or if the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not present at
     the meeting, the Vice Chairman of the Board, or such other person as may be
     designated by the directors to preside shall be Chairman of the meeting.

66.  The chairman may, with the consent of the meeting, adjourn any meeting from
     time to time, and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted
     at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the
     meeting from which the adjournment took place.

67.  At any meeting of the members the chairman shall be responsible for
     deciding in such manner as he shall consider appropriate whether any
     resolution has been carried or not and the result of his decision shall be
     announced to the meeting and recorded in the minutes thereof.  If the
     chairman shall have any doubt as to the outcome of any resolution put to
     the vote, he shall cause a poll to be taken of all votes cast upon such
     resolution, but if the chairman shall fail to take a poll then any member
     present in person or by proxy who disputes the announcement by the chairman
     of the result of any vote may immediately following such announcement
     demand that a poll be taken and the chairman shall thereupon cause a poll
     to be taken.  If a poll is taken at any meeting, the result thereof shall
     be duly recorded in the minutes of that meeting by the chairman.

68.  Any person other than an individual shall be regarded as one member and
     subject to the specific provisions hereinafter contained for the
     appointment of representatives of such persons the right of any individual
     to speak for or represent such member shall be determined by the law of the
     jurisdiction where, and by

<PAGE>

     the documents by which, the person is constituted or derives its existence.
     In case of doubt, the directors may in good faith seek legal advice from
     any qualified person and unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction
     shall otherwise rule, the directors may rely and act upon such advice
     without incurring any liability to any member.

69.  Any person other than an individual which is a member of the Company may by
     resolution of its directors or other governing body authorize such person
     as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company
     or of any class of members of the Company, and the person so authorized
     shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the person which
     he represents as that person could exercise if it were an individual member
     of the Company.

70.  The chairman of any meeting at which a vote is cast by proxy or on behalf
     of any person other than an individual may call for a notarially certified
     copy of such proxy or authority which shall be produced within 7 days of
     being so requested or the votes cast by such proxy or on behalf of such
     person shall be disregarded.

71.  Directors of the Company may attend and speak at any meeting of members of
     the Company and at any separate meeting of the holders of any class or
     series of shares in the Company.

72.  An action that may be taken by the members at a meeting may also be taken
     by a resolution of members consented to in writing or by telex, telegram,
     cable, facsimile or other written electronic communication, without the
     need for any notice, but if any resolution of members is adopted otherwise
     than by the unanimous written consent of all members, a copy of such
     resolution shall forthwith be sent to all members not consenting to such
     resolution.  The consent may be in the form of counterparts, each
     counterpart being signed by one or more members.

     the Memorandum; and at the first meeting of members at which directors are
     to be elected, the directors shall be divided into three classes, as nearly
     equal in number as possible.  One class of directors shall be initially
     elected for a one-year term, another class shall be initially elected for a
     two-year term and another class shall be initially elected for a three-year
     term.  At each succeeding meeting at which directors are to be elected, the
     successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting
     shall be elected by a plurality vote of all votes cast at such meeting to
     hold office for a three-year term.

74.  The minimum number of directors shall be three and the maximum number shall
     be twelve.

                                      15
<PAGE>

75.  Each director shall hold office until his successor is elected or until his
     earlier death, resignation or removal.

76.  A director may be removed from office, with cause, by a resolution of
     members or by a resolution of directors.

77.  A director may resign his office by giving written notice of his
     resignation to the Company and the resignation shall have effect from the
     date the notice is received by the Company or from such later date as may
     be specified in the notice.

78.  The directors may at any time appoint any person to be a director either to
     fill a vacancy or as an addition to the existing directors.  A vacancy
     occurs through the death, resignation or removal of a director, but a
     vacancy or vacancies shall not be deemed to exist where one or more
     directors shall resign after having appointed his or their successor or
     successors.

79.  The Company may determine by resolution of directors to keep a register of
     directors containing

     (a)  the names and addresses of the persons who are directors of the

     (c)  the date on which each person named as a director ceased to be a
          director of the Company.

80.  If the directors determine to maintain a register of directors, a copy

     Company may determine by resolution of directors to register a copy of the
     register with the Registrar of Companies.

8l.  The directors may, by a resolution of directors, fix the emoluments of
     directors with respect to services to be rendered in any capacity to the

83.  The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by the directors
     who may pay all expenses incurred preliminary to and in connection with the
     formation and registration of the Company and may exercise all such powers
     of the Company as are not by the Act or by the Memorandum or these Articles
     required to be exercised by the members of the Company, subject to any
     delegation of such powers as may be authorized by these Articles and to
     such requirements as may be prescribed by a resolution of

                                      16
<PAGE>

     members; but no requirement made by a resolution of members shall prevail
     if it be inconsistent with these Articles nor shall such requirement
     invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if
     such requirement had not been made.

84.  The directors may, by a resolution of directors, appoint any person,
     including a person who is a director, to be an officer or agent of the
     Company.  The resolution of directors appointing an agent may authorize the
     agent to   appoint one or more substitutes or delegates to exercise  some
     or all of the powers conferred on the agent by the Company.

85.  Every officer or agent of the Company has such powers and authority of the
     directors, including the power and authority to affix the Seal, as are set
     forth in these Articles or in the resolution of directors appointing the
     officer or agent, except that no officer or agent has any power or
     authority with respect to the matters requiring a resolution of directors
     under the Act.

86.  Any director which is a body corporate may appoint any person its duly
     authorized representative for the purpose of representing it at meetings of
     the Board of Directors or with respect to unanimous written consents.

87.  The continuing directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body,
     save that if their number is reduced to their knowledge below the number
     fixed by or pursuant to these Articles as the necessary quorum for a
     meeting of directors, the continuing directors or director may act only for
     the purpose of appointing directors to fill any vacancy that has arisen or
     for summoning a meeting of members.

88.  The directors may by resolution of directors exercise all the powers of the
     Company to borrow money and to mortgage or charge its undertakings and
     property or any part thereof, to issue debentures, debenture stock and
     other securities whenever money is borrowed or as security for any debt,
     liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party.

89.  All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other
     negotiable instruments and all receipts for moneys paid to  the  Company,
     shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise executed, as the
     case may be, in such manner as shall from time to time be determined by
     resolution of directors.

90.  The Company may determine by resolution of directors to maintain at its
     registered office a register of mortgages, charges and other encumbrances
     in which there shall be entered the following particulars regarding each
     mortgage, charge and other encumbrance:

     (a)  the sum secured;

       (e) the date on which the particulars specified above in respect of the
           mortgage, charge or other encumbrance are entered in the register.

9l.  The Company may further determine by a resolution of directors to register
     a copy of the register of mortgages, charges or other encumbrances with the
     Registrar of Companies.

                           PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

92.  The directors of the Company or any committee thereof may meet at such
     times and in such manner and places within or outside the British Virgin
     Islands as the directors may determine to be necessary or desirable.

93.  A director shall be deemed to be present at a meeting of directors  if he
     participates by telephone or other electronic means and all directors
     participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

94.  A director shall be given not less than 3 days notice of meetings of
     directors, but a meeting of directors held without 3 days notice having
     been given to all directors shall be valid if all the directors entitled to
     vote at the meeting who do not attend, waive notice of the meeting and for
     this purpose, the presence of a director at a meeting shall constitute
     waiver on his part.  The inadvertent failure to give notice of a meeting to
     a director, or the fact that a director has not received the notice, does
     not invalidate the meeting.

95.  A director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be
     a director and an alternate is entitled to attend meetings in the absence
     of the director who appointed him and to vote or consent in place of the
     director.

     commencement of the meeting there are present in person or by alternate not
     less than one-half of the total number of directors.

97.  At every meeting of the directors the Chairman of the Board of Directors
     shall preside as chairman of the meeting.  If there is no Chairman of the
     Board of Directors or if the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not
     present at the meeting the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors shall
     preside.  If  there  is  no  Vice-Chairman  of the Board of Directors or if
     the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors is not present at the

                                      18
<PAGE>

     meeting the directors present shall choose some one of their number to be
     chairman of the meeting.

98.  An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at
     a meeting may also be taken by a resolution of directors or a committee of
     directors consented to in writing or by telex, telegram, cable, facsimile
     or other written electronic communication by not less than two-thirds of
     all directors or not less than two-thirds of all members of the committee
     as the case may be, without the need for any notice.  The consent may be in
     the form of counterparts, each counterpart being signed by one or more
     directors.

99.  The directors shall cause the following corporate records to be kept:

     (a)  minutes of all meetings of directors, members, committees of
          directors, committees of officers and committees of members;

     (b)  copies of all resolutions consented to by directors, members,
          committees of directors, committees of officers and committees of

          directors consider necessary or desirable in order to reflect the
          financial position of the Company.

     the Company, its principal place of business or at such other place as the
     directors determine.

101. The directors may, by resolution of directors, designate one or more
     committees, each consisting of one or more directors.

102. Each committee of directors has such powers and authorities of the
     directors, including the power and authority to affix the Seal, as are set
     forth in the resolution of directors establishing the committee, except
     that no committee has any power or authority  to amend the Memorandum or
     these Articles, to appoint directors or fix their emoluments, or to appoint
     officers or agents of the Company.

103. The meetings and proceedings of each committee of directors consisting of
     2 or more directors shall be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of
     these Articles regulating the proceedings of directors so far as the same
     are not superseded by any provisions in the resolution establishing the
     committee.

                                   OFFICERS

104. The Company may by resolution of directors appoint officers of the Company
     at such times as shall be

                                      19
<PAGE>

     considered necessary or expedient. Such officers may consist of a Chairman
     of the Board of Directors, a Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, a
     President and one or more Vice-Presidents, Secretaries and Treasurers and
     such other officers as may from time to time be deemed desirable. Any
     number of offices may be held by the same person.

105. The officers shall perform such duties as shall be prescribed at the time
     of their appointment subject to any modification in such duties as may be
     prescribed thereafter by resolution of directors or resolution of members,
     but in the absence of any specific allocation of duties it shall be the
     responsibility of the Chairman of the Board of Directors to preside at
     meetings of directors and members, the Vice-Chairman to act in the absence
     of the Chairman, the President to manage the day to day affairs of the
     Company, the Vice-Presidents to act in order of seniority in the absence of
     the President but otherwise to perform such duties as may be delegated to
     them by the President, the Secretaries to maintain the share register,
     minute books and records (other than financial records) of the Company and
     to ensure compliance with all procedural requirements imposed on the
     Company by applicable law, and the Treasurer to be responsible for the
     financial affairs of the Company.

106. The emoluments of all officers shall be fixed by resolution of directors.

107. The officers of the Company shall hold office until their successors are
     duly elected and qualified, but any officer elected or appointed by the
     directors may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by resolution
     of directors.  Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Company may be
     filled by resolution of directors.

                             CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

108. No agreement or transaction between the Company and one or more of its
     directors or any person in which any director has a financial interest or
     to whom any director is related, including as a director of that other
     person, is void or voidable for this reason only or by reason only that the
     director is present at the meeting of directors or at the meeting of the
     committee of directors that approves the agreement or transaction or that
     the vote or consent of the director is counted for that purpose if (i) the
     material facts of the interest of each director in the agreement or
     transaction and his interest in or relationship to any other party to the
     agreement or transaction are disclosed in good faith or are known by the
     other directors and (ii) the agreement or transaction is approved or
     ratified by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Company or is
     otherwise fair to the Company.  Section 56(3A) of the Act shall not apply
     to any agreement or transaction between (a) the Company and (b) one or more
     of its directors, or any person in which any director has a financial
     interest or

                                      20
<PAGE>

     to whom any director is related, including as a director of that other
     person.

109.  A director who has an interest in any particular business         to be
considered at a meeting of  directors or  members may  be counted for purposes
of determining whether the meeting is duly constituted.

                                INDEMNIFICATION

110. Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided the Company may indemnify
     against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments,
     fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in connection
     with legal, administrative  or  investigative proceedings any person who

     (a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
         threatened, pending or completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
         administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that the person
         is or was a director, an officer or a liquidator of the Company; or

     (b)  is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a director,
          officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting
          for, another company or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
          enterprise.

111. The Company may only indemnify a person if the person acted honestly and
     in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company and, in the
     case of criminal proceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe
     that his conduct was unlawful.

112. The decision of the directors as to whether the person acted honestly and
     in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company and as
     to whether the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct
     was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of
     these Articles, unless a question of law is involved.

113. The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement,
     conviction or the entering of a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create
     a presumption that the person did not act honestly and in good faith and
     with a view to the best interests of the Company or that the person had
     reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

114. If a person to be indemnified has been successful in defence of any
     proceedings referred to above the person is entitled to be indemnified
     against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments,
     fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred by the person
     in connection with the proceedings.

                                      21
<PAGE>

115. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance in relation to any person
     who is or was a director, an officer or a liquidator of the Company, or who
     at the request of the Company is or was serving as a director, an officer
     or a liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another
     company or a  partnership, joint  venture, trust or other enterprise,
     against  any  liability  asserted against the person and incurred by the
     person in that capacity, whether or not the Company has or would have had
     the power to indemnify the person against the liability as provided in
     these Articles.

                                     SEAL

116. The Company may have more than one Seal and references herein to the Seal
     shall be references to every Seal which shall have been duly adopted by
     resolution of directors. The directors shall provide for the safe custody
     of the Seal and for an imprint thereof to be kept at the Registered Office.
     Except as otherwise expressly provided herein the Seal when affixed to any
     written instrument shall be witnessed and attested to by the signature of a
     director or any other person so authorized from time to time by resolution
     of directors. Such authorization may be before or after the Seal is
     affixed, may be general or specific and may refer to any number of
     sealings. The Directors may provide for a facsimile of the Seal and of the
     signature of any director or authorized person which may be reproduced by
     printing or other means on any instrument and it shall have the same force
     and validity as if the Seal had been affixed to such instrument and the
     same had been signed as hereinbefore described.


                                   DIVIDENDS

117. The Company may by a resolution of directors declare and pay dividends in
     money, shares, or other property, but dividends shall only be declared and
     paid out of surplus. In the event that dividends are paid in specie the
     directors shall have responsibility for establishing and recording in the
     resolution of directors authorizing the dividends, a fair and proper value
     for the assets to be so distributed.

118. The directors may from time to time pay to the members such interim
     dividends as appear to the directors to be justified by the profits of the
     Company.

119. The directors may, before declaring any dividend, set aside out of the
     profits of the Company such sum as they think proper as a reserve fund, and
     may invest the sum so set aside as a reserve fund upon such securities as
     they may select.

                                      22
<PAGE>

120. No dividend shall be declared and paid unless the directors determine that
     immediately after the payment of the dividend the Company will be able to
     satisfy its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of its
     business and the realizable value of the assets of the Company will not be
     less than the sum of its total liabilities, other than deferred taxes, as
     shown in its books of account, and its capital.  In  the  absence  of
     fraud,  the  decision of the directors as to the realizable value of the
     assets of the Company is conclusive, unless a question of law is involved.

121. Notice of any dividend that may have been declared shall be given to each
     member in manner hereinafter mentioned and all dividends unclaimed for 3
     years after having been declared may be forfeited by resolution of
     directors for the benefit of the Company.

122. No dividend shall bear interest as against the Company and no dividend
     shall be paid on treasury shares or shares held by another company of which
     the Company holds, directly or indirectly, shares having more than 50
     percent of the vote in electing directors.

123. A share issued as a dividend by the Company shall be treated for all
     purposes as having been issued for money equal to the surplus that is
     transferred to capital upon the issue of the share.

124. In the case of a dividend of authorized but unissued shares with par
     value, an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the shares shall be
     transferred from surplus to capital at the time of the distribution.

125. In the case of a dividend of authorized but unissued shares without par
     value, the amount designated by the directors shall be transferred from
     surplus to capital at the time of the distribution, except that the
     directors must designate as capital an amount that is at least equal to the
     amount that the shares are entitled to as a preference, if any, in the
     assets of the Company upon liquidation of the Company.

126. A division of the issued and outstanding shares of a class or series of
     shares into a larger number of shares of the same class or series having a
     proportionately smaller par value does not constitute a dividend of shares.

                              ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT

127. The Company may by resolution of members call for the directors to prepare
     periodically a profit and loss account and a balance sheet.  The profit and
     loss account and balance sheet shall be drawn up so as to give respectively
     a true and fair view of the profit and loss of the Company for the
     financial period and a true and fair view of the  state of affairs of the
     Company as at the end of the financial period.

                                      23

     examined by auditors. 129. The first auditors shall be appointed by

          or in such manner as the Company may by resolution of members
          determine.

132.  The auditors shall examine each profit and loss account and balance sheet
     required to be served on every member of the Company or laid before a
     meeting of the members of the Company and shall state in a written report
     whether or not

     (a)  in their opinion the profit and loss account and balance sheet
          give a true and fair view respectively of the profit and loss for the
          period covered by the accounts, and of the state of affairs of the
          Company at the end of that period; and

     (b)  all the information and explanations required by the auditors
          have been obtained.

133. The report of the auditors shall be annexed to the accounts and shall be
     read at the meeting of members at which the accounts are laid before the
     Company or shall be served on the members.

134. Every auditor of the Company shall have a right of access at all times to
     the books of account and vouchers of the Company, and shall be entitled to
     require from the directors and officers of the Company such information and
     explanations as he thinks necessary for the performance of the duties of
     the auditors.

135. The auditors of the Company shall be entitled to receive notice of, and to
     attend any meetings of members of the Company at which the Company's profit
     and loss account and balance sheet are to be presented.

                                    NOTICES

136. Any notice, information or written statement to be given by the Company to
     members may be served in the case of members holding registered shares in
     any way by which it

                                      24
<PAGE>

     can reasonably be expected to reach each member or by mail addressed to
     each member at the address shown in the share register.

137.  Any summons, notice, order, document, process, information or written

     registered agent of the Company.

138. Service of any summons, notice, order, document, process, information or

     the summons, notice, order, document, process, information or written
     statement was delivered to the registered office or the registered agent of
     the Company or that it was mailed in such time as to admit to its being
     delivered to the registered office or the registered agent of the Company
     in the normal course of delivery within the period prescribed for service
     and was correctly addressed and the postage was prepaid.

                       PENSION AND SUPERANNUATION FUNDS

139. The directors may establish and maintain or procure the establishment and
     maintenance of any non-contributory or contributory pension or
     superannuation funds for the benefit of, and give or procure the giving of
     donations, gratuities, pensions, allowances or emoluments to, any persons

     person, and may make payments for or towards the insurance of any such
     persons as aforesaid, and may do  any  of  the  matters aforesaid either
     alone or in conjunction with any such other  company as aforesaid.  Subject
     always to the proposal being approved by resolution of members, a director
     holding any such employment or office shall be entitled to participate in
     and retain for his own benefit any such donation, gratuity, pension
     allowance or emolument.

     parties to the difference and the arbitrators shall before entering on the
     reference appoint an umpire.

141. If either party to the reference makes default in appointing an
     arbitrator either originally or by way of substitution (in the event that
     an appointed arbitrator shall die, be incapable of acting or refuse to act)
     for 10 days after the other party has given him notice to appoint the same,
     such other party may appoint an arbitrator to act in the place of the
     arbitrator of the defaulting party.

                     VOLUNTARY WINDING UP AND DISSOLUTION
