    ITEM 1. BUSINESS.


    GENERAL
       Tandy Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was
    incorporated in 1967 ("Tandy" or the"Company").  The Company
    engages in the retail sale of consumer electronics including
    personal computers primarily in the United States.  The
    Company's retail operations include the Radio Shack(R),
    McDuff Electronics(R), The Edge in Electronics(R), Computer
    City(R) and Incredible Universe(R) store chains as well as
    some new test concepts.  See "Management's Discussion and
    Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition"
    found in Item 7 for a discussion of divisional sales data.

          Radio Shack.  Radio Shack is the Company's largest
        operating division.  At December 31, 1994, Radio Shack
        had 4,598 company-owned stores located throughout the
        United States.  These stores average approximately 2,350
        square feet in area and are located in major malls, strip
        centers and individual store fronts, primarily in
        metropolitan markets.  To provide service to smaller
        communities, Radio Shack had on the same date a network
        of 2,005 dealer/franchise stores.  The dealers are
        generally engaged in other retail operations and augment
        their sales with Radio Shack products.  This network
        includes 67 international dealers at December 31, 1994.

          The 4,598 company-owned stores carry a broad assortment
        of electronic parts and accessories, audio/video
        equipment, personal computers, cellular and conventional
        telephones as well as specialized products such as
        scanners, electronic toys and hard to find batteries.
        The personal computers, which account for approximately
        12% of Radio Shack's sales, primarily target entry level
        users seeking computers for home, individual and small
        business use.  The Company plans to open 100 company-
        owned Radio Shack stores each year for the next five
        years.  Many of these new stores will be in major markets
        such as Chicago, New York, Atlanta and Los Angeles.
        Radio Shack is also focusing on Alternative Channels of
        Distribution ("ACD"), which are geared to enhance its
        "service oriented" approach.  A few ACDs include The
        Repair Shop at Radio Shack(SM), Radio Shack Gift
        Express(SM), and direct delivery service.

          Computer City.  As of December 31, 1994, the Company
        had 69 Computer City(R) stores open, four of which were
        in Europe and three in Canada.  The Computer City chain
        operates as a supercenter format featuring many name
        brand computers, software and related products, including
        U.S.  Logic, IBM, Apple, Sony, Lotus, Borland, Microsoft,
        Packard-Bell, Compaq, AST and Hewlett-Packard.  The
        sixty-one Computer City Supercenters average about 23,000
        square feet and carry more than 5,000 products.  At
        December 31, 1994, there were eight Computer City
        Express(SM) stores which are approximately 10,000 square
        feet and serve smaller markets.  The Company plans to
        open 20 to 30 additional stores in 1995, which includes 6
        to 10 Computer City Express stores.

          Incredible Universe.  At December 31, 1994, Tandy
        operated nine Incredible Universe(R) stores.  These
        stores are approximately 184,000 square feet and offer a
        broad selection of consumer electronics and appliances.
        The Company opened its ninth store in Auburn, Washington
        late in 1994.  In 1995 the Company plans to open stores
        in Denver, Indianapolis, New York Metro, Houston, San
        Diego, Salt Lake City and greater Washington, D.C.,
        markets.  In addition, one more Incredible Universe store
        may open in 1995.

          Tandy Name Brand Retail Group.  At December 31, 1994,
        the Tandy Name Brand Retail Group ("Tandy Name Brand")
        was comprised of VideoConcepts(R), McDuff Electronics and
        Appliance(R) Supercenters and The Edge in Electronics(R)
        retail outlets.  This group then operated a total of 306
        stores which sold name brand televisions, audio
        equipment, personal computers and other electronic
        products and appliances.

          Tandy Name Brand operated three distinctly different
        types of store formats -- mall stores, boutique stores
        and supercenters.  The 219 mall stores averaged 3,100
        square feet in size while the 71 supercenters, which are
        located in stand-alone or strip center locations,
        averaged 12,300 square feet.  The Edge in Electronics
        began operating in 1990.  These electronic boutique
        stores are designed for mall customers interested in
        fashionable personal and portable name brand electronics.
        As of December 31, 1994, these 16 stores were located in
        major malls and averaged approximately 1,100 square feet.

          On December 30, 1994, the Company adopted a business
        restructuring plan to close or convert 233 stores which
        included VideoConcept and McDuff Electronics mall stores
        and a few McDuff Electronics and Appliance Supercenters.
        The stores will be closed during the first quarter of
        1995.  Of the 233 stores, 33 sites will be converted to
        Radio Shack or Computer City Express stores.  On January
        3, 1995, the Company also announced that Tandy Name Brand
        will be dissolved and the continuing stores will become
        part of a new Specialty Retail Group of the Radio Shack
        division.  This group will be comprised of McDuff
        Electronics and Appliance Supercenters, The Edge in
        Electronics, Famous Brand Electronics Warehouse and
        Audio, Video and Computers retail outlets.  See
        "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
        Operations and Financial Condition" found in Item 7 and
        Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
        for more information on the plan.

          The Company closed 110 Tandy Name Brand stores in the
        first quarter of 1993.  See "Management's Discussion
        and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
        Condition" found in Item 7 and Note 4 of the Notes to
        Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

        Supporting the retail operations is an extensive
    infrastructure that includes:

          A&A International, Inc. - This wholly-owned subsidiary
        of the Company serves the wide-ranging international
        import/export, sourcing, evaluation, logistics and
        quality control needs of the Company.  InterTAN Inc.
        ("InterTAN") is the largest outside customer of the
        Company.  Most of A&A's activity for InterTAN involves
        sourcing of goods from manufacturers in the Far East.
        For more discussion on InterTAN see Note 22 of the Notes
        to Consolidated Financial Statements.

          Tandy Service Centers - The Company maintains a large
        service and support network in the consumer electronics
        retail industry.  These centers repair name brand and
        private label products sold through all of the Company's
        retail distribution channels.  These centers are also the
        primary support for the Repair Shop at Radio Shack
        program.  There are 128 service centers throughout the
        nation and Canada and over one million parts are stocked
        in the Tandy Service division.

          Regional Distribution Centers - The 15 distribution
        centers ship over one million cartons each month to the
        Company's retail outlets.  This group also supports the
        Radio Shack Gift Express service.

          Tandy Information Services - TIS collects information
        from the retail stores nationwide and updates a large
        database with sales and other information.  This database
        is a sophisticated marketing tool benefiting every phase
        of the Company's operations.  TIS also processes
        inventory, accounting, payroll, telecommunications and
        other operating information for all of the Company's
        operations.  In addition, specialized information is
        tracked for the Company's distribution and corporate
        activities.

          Tandy Credit Corporation - This operation, a wholly
        owned subsidiary of the Company, has helped to support
        sales of the Company's retail operations and provided the
        retail divisions with additional marketing flexibility
        through the utilization of credit promotions.  This group
        has in the past maintained and managed Tandy's various
        private label credit cards.

          In December 1994, the Company sold the Computer City
        and Incredible Universe credit card portfolios to SPS
        Transaction Services, Inc.("SPS"), a majority-owned
        subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Co.  In January
        1995, the Company signed an agreement with SPS to sell
        Tandy Credit and the Radio Shack and McDuff private label
        credit card portfolios.  The sale of Tandy Credit and the
        sale of the Radio Shack and McDuff portfolios is
        contingent upon and subject to regulatory, rating agency
        and other approvals.  This transaction is expected to
        close during the first half of 1995.  See "Management's
        Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
        Financial Condition" found in Item 7 and Note 3 of
        the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more
        information.

          Tandy National Bank (the "Bank"), a limited purpose
        nationally chartered credit card bank, was established on
        May 11, 1994.  The Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
        Tandy Corporation, was created to operate the private
        label consumer credit card programs for Tandy.  All new
        accounts approved after May 12, 1994 were originated and
        owned by the Bank.  After the Company's sale of all
        the private label credit card portfolios, the Bank will
        cease operations.

          Tandy Transportation, Inc. - A large fleet of tractors
        and trailers transports much of the merchandise from the
        ports of entry to the Company's regional distribution
        centers and local distribution facilities for delivery to
        the Company's retail outlets.

          Consumer Electronics Manufacturing - The Company also
        engages in the manufacturing business with nine
        manufacturing facilities in the United States and two
        overseas manufacturing operations in China and Taiwan.
        The China operation is a joint venture.  These 11
        manufacturing facilities cover a total of 1,472,000
        square feet and employ approximately 4,000 workers and
        professionals as of December 31, 1994.  The Company
        manufactures a variety of products for use in its
        consumer electronics retailing operations.  The products
        include audio, video, telephony, antennas, wire and cable
        products and a wide variety of hard to find parts for
        consumer electronic products.  Most of the Company's
        manufacturing output is sold through the Radio Shack
        store chain.  The Taiwan manufacturing plant will be
        closed in the first half of 1995 and its products will be
        manufactured by the China operations.

    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
       On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy adopted
    a formal plan of divestiture under which it would sell its
    computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the
    O'Sullivan Industries, Inc.("O'Sullivan") ready-to-assemble
    furniture manufacturing and related marketing business, the
    Memtek Products division and the Lika printed circuit board
    business.  See "Discontinued Operations" in Management's
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
    Financial Condition for further discussion.

       The Company closed the sale of the computer manufacturing
    and marketing businesses to AST Research, Inc. ("AST") on
    July 13, 1993, and the sale of Memtek Products manufacturing
    and marketing operations on December 16, 1993 to Hanny
    Magnetics (B.V.I.) Limited, a British Virgin Islands
    corporation, including the license agreement with Memorex
    Telex, N.V. for the use of the Memorex trademark on licensed
    consumer electronics products.  On February 2, 1994, the
    Company sold all the common stock of O'Sullivan Industries
    Holdings, Inc., the parent company of O'Sullivan, to the
    public at $22 per share.  On October 11, 1994, Tandy sold the
    assets used in its Lika(R) printed circuit board division to
    Viktron Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership.
    The proceeds from the sale and liquidation of assets
    approximated $16,380,000 which included $7,754,000 in cash,
    proceeds from liquidation of retained assets of $5,594,000
    and secured promissory notes for $3,032,000.

       In connection with the computer manufacturing sale, the
    Memtek Products sale and the Lika sale, the Company agreed to
    retain certain liabilities primarily relating to warranty
    obligations on products sold prior to the sale.  Management
    believes that accrued reserves, as reflected on its December
    31, 1994 balance sheet, are adequate to cover estimated
    future warranty obligations for the products.

    SEASONALITY
       As is the case with other retail businesses, the Company's
    net sales and other revenues are greater during the Christmas
    season than during other periods of the year.  There is a
    corresponding pre-seasonal inventory build-up requiring
    working capital associated with the anticipated increased
    sales volume.  For additional information, see Note 23 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

    PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
       Tandy owns or is licensed to use many trademarks related
    to its business in the United States and in foreign
    countries.  Radio Shack, Computer City, Incredible Universe,
    McDuff Electronics, VideoConcepts, Realistic, Tandy and
    Optimus are some of the registered marks most widely used by
    the Company.  Tandy believes that the Radio Shack, Computer
    City and Incredible Universe names and marks are
    well-recognized and associated with a high-quality service
    provider by consumers.  The Company's products are sold
    primarily under the Radio Shack, Optimus, Tandy, Computer
    City and Realistic trademarks which are registered in the
    U.S. and many foreign countries.  The Company believes that
    the loss of the Radio Shack name or mark would be material to
    its business, but does not believe that the loss of any one
    trademark registration would be material.

       Tandy also owns various patents relating to retail and
    support functions and various products which Tandy has
    previously designed and manufactures.

    SUPPLIERS
       The Company obtains merchandise from a large number of
    suppliers from various parts of the world.  Alternative
    sources of supply exist for most merchandise and raw
    materials purchased by the Company.  As the Company's product
    line is diverse, the Company would not expect a lack of
    availability of any single product or raw material to have a
    material impact on its operations.

    BACKLOG ORDERS
       The Company has no material backlog of orders for the
    products it sells.

    COMPETITION
       The consumer electronics retail business is highly
    competitive.  The Company competes in the sale of its
    products and services with department stores, mail order
    houses, discount stores, general merchants, home appliance
    stores and gift stores which sell comparable products
    manufactured by others.  Competitors range in size from local
    drug and hardware stores to large chains and department
    stores.  Computer store chains and franchise groups as well
    as independent computer stores and several major retailers
    compete with the Company in the retail personal computer
    marketplace.  Consumer electronic and computer mail-order
    companies also compete with the Company.  The products which
    compete with those sold by the Company are manufactured by
    numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers.  Many of these
    products carry nationally recognized brand names or private
    labels and are sold in markets common to the Company.  Some
    of the Company's competitors have financial resources equal
    to or greater than the Company's resources.

       Management believes that among the factors that are
    important to its competitive position are price, quality,
    service and the broad selection of electronic products and
    computers carried at conveniently located retail outlets. 
    The Company's utilization of trained personnel and its
    ability to use national and local advertising media are
    important to the Company's ability to compete in the consumer
    electronics marketplace.  Management of the Company believes
    it is a strong competitor with respect to each of the factors
    referenced above.  Given the highly competitive nature of the
    consumer electronics retail business, no assurance can be
    given that the Company will continue to compete successfully
    with respect to each of the factors referenced above.  Also,
    the Company would be adversely affected if its competitors
    were to offer their products at significantly lower prices,
    introduce innovative or technologically superior products not
    yet available to the Company or if the Company were unable to
    obtain products in a timely manner for an extended period of
    time.

       The Company focuses on various types of store formats to
    address the marketplace.  Each of the Company's retailing
    formats uses a distinct but complementary path to the
    marketplace, based on its unique customer appeal, marketing
    strengths and margin structure.

         Radio Shack.  Radio Shack(R) stores offer the shopping
           convenience of approximately 6,600 dealers and
           company-owned stores, high-quality private label
           products, unique selection, knowledgeable personnel
           and excellent customer service.  Radio Shack has
           strong sales in approximately 3,200 different items in
           such consumer-demand product categories as speakers,
           batteries, communications equipment, tape decks,
           antennas, electronic components and accessories.

         Computer City.  Computer City(R) stores offer
           approximately 5,000 different name-brand items,
           competitive prices and excellent customer service on
           computers, computer software and accessories.  While
           the SuperCenters are approximately 23,000 square feet,
           Computer City Express stores average 10,000 square
           feet and serve smaller markets and also supplement
           SuperCenters in larger markets.

         Incredible Universe.  A new concept in the retailing of
           name brand consumer electronics and appliances, these
           stores are approximately 184,000 square feet in size
           and carry over 85,000 different stock-keeping units
           which provide the customer with a "universe" of
           choices.

         Tandy Name Brand.  In the past the Company has sold name
           brand consumer electronics and appliances through
           Tandy Name Brand which included three distinctly
           different types of store formats.  The Tandy Name
           Brand group will be dissolved and continuing stores
           will be integrated into the Radio Shack division as
           the Specialty Retail Group.

       The Company has faced intense competition in its consumer
    electronics retailing businesses.  Competition is driven by
    technology and product cycles, as well as the economy.  In
    the consumer electronics retailing business, competitive
    factors include price, product quality, product features,
    consumer services, manufacturing and distribution capability
    and brand reputation.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
       Research and development expenditures are not significant.

    EMPLOYEES
       As of December 31, 1994, the Company had approximately
    45,800 employees, excluding approximately 1,700 full time
    employees associated with the Tandy Name Brand, Tandy Credit
    Division and Service Contract group which the Company has
    announced it will close or sell.  The number includes
    approximately 4,000 temporary retail employees remaining from
    the Christmas selling season.  Management of the Company
    considers the relationship between the Company and its
    employees to be good.  It does not anticipate any work
    stoppage due to labor difficulties.

       The Company leases rather than owns most of its retail
    facilities.  However, the buildings of three of the
    Incredible Universe stores are owned rather than leased.  The
    Radio Shack, Tandy Name Brand and Computer City stores are
    located primarily in major shopping malls, stand-alone
    buildings or shopping centers owned by other companies.  The
    Company owns most of the property on which its executive
    offices are located in Fort Worth, Texas as well as five
    distribution facilities and most of its manufacturing
    facilities and land located throughout the United States.
    Existing warehouse and office facilities are deemed adequate
    to meet the Company's needs in the foreseeable future.

    ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
       The Company is a defendant in a consolidated action titled
    "O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation",
    which was commenced in 1994 and is currently pending before
    the United States District Court for the Western District of
    Missouri.  The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified
    amount alleging that O'Sullivan's initial public offering
    prospectus, certain press releases and other materials
    contained material misrepresentations and omissions.  They
    have also named O'Sullivan, O'Sullivan's officers and
    directors, and the underwriters as defendants.  Tandy
    believes that the lawsuit is totally without merit and is
    defending itself vigorously.  It further believes that even
    though an adverse resolution of the litigation may have a
    negative impact on its results of operations in the year of
    resolution, resolution will not have a material adverse
    effect on its financial condition or liquidity.

       Tandy has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third
    parties, investigations and pending actions involving
    allegations of negligence, product defects, discrimination,
    infringement of intellectual property rights, securities
    matters, tax deficiencies, violations of permits or licenses,
    and breach of contract and other matters against the Company
    and its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its
    business.  The liability, if any, associated with these
    matters was not determinable at December 31, 1994.  While
    certain of these matters involve substantial amounts, and
    although occasional adverse settlements or resolutions may
    occur and negatively impact earnings in the year of
    settlement, it is the opinion of management that their
    ultimate resolution will not have a materially adverse effect
    on Tandy's financial position.

    ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF
             OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

       Tandy Corporation ("Tandy" or the "Company") changed its
    fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31 effective
    December 31, 1992.

       The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of
    Results of Operations and Financial Condition compares the
    year ended December 31, 1994 with the years ended December
    31, 1993 and June 30, 1992.  Although the years ended
    December 31, 1993 and June 30, 1992 end at different times of
    the year, management believes that the seasonality of the
    retail business relating to Christmas is so significant that
    it would distort trends and related percentage comparisons to
    sales for the readers if a full year's results were compared
    to the six-month transition period ended December 31, 1992.
    Information for the six months ended December 31, 1992 is
    included in the tables herein for informational purposes
    only.  Significant events occurring during such period are
    described in the respective sections below.

    </TABLE>

       For the year ended December 31, 1994, Tandy's sales
    increased 21% to $4,943,679,000 from $4,102,551,000 for the
    year ended December 31, 1993.  The increase in sales was
    primarily attributable to the addition of six Incredible
    Universe(R) and 29 Computer City(R) stores during 1994.  A
    net increase of 45 company-owned Radio Shack(R) stores also
    contributed to the sales increase.  Partially offsetting
    these upward trends in sales was an overall decline in sales
    for Tandy Name Brand.  This decline can be partially
    attributed to the fact that 110 McDuff(R) and
    VideoConcepts(R) stores were closed during February 1993. 
    See "Provision for Business Restructuring" below for further
    discussion of Tandy Name Brand.

       Tandy posted a 5% same store sales increase with all
    divisions showing same store increases during the year. 
    Radio Shack and Computer City achieved same store sales
    increases of 5% while the Tandy Name Brand group was only up
    slightly.  Radio Shack same store sales increases continue to
    be attributable to its focus on its core business (i.e.
    consumer electronics, cellular telephones, parts and
    accessories) which have higher margins versus personal
    computers which have smaller margins.  Incredible Universe,
    with three old stores, experienced a 20% comparable stores
    sales gain during calendar 1994.  Same store sales increases
    reflect growing demand for consumer electronics amid a strong
    economy.

       During 1994, Tandy and InterTAN Inc. ("InterTAN") entered
    into a new import/export agreement under which Tandy's A&A
    operations would act as InterTAN's agent in importing
    consumer electronics from the Far East.  Commencing in March
    1994, only the purchasing agent commission and sales made by
    Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN were recorded as
    sales.  InterTAN purchases from third parties through A&A are
    no longer recorded as sales, reflecting the arrangement under
    the new merchandise agreement; however, commission income is
    reported as operating revenue.  Accordingly, reported sales
    by Tandy to InterTAN in 1994, reflected in Import/Export and
    Other Sales, were considerably lower than in 1993, however,
    the earned income relating thereto was not materially
    different.  See the discussion in the "InterTAN Update" found
    below.

       For the year ended December 31, 1993, overall sales grew
    12% to $4,102,551,000 as compared to $3,649,284,000 for the
    fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  This increase was primarily
    due to the opening of three Incredible Universe stores and
    the expansion of the Computer City store chain.  Computer
    City sales increases were the result of 25 additional stores
    since June 30, 1992 and comparable store sales gains at old
    stores in excess of 30% for the year ended December 31, 1993.
    Tandy Name Brand experienced a sales decrease in calendar
    1993 as compared to the June 1992 fiscal year.  This decrease
    was primarily a result of the closing of 110 McDuff and
    VideoConcepts stores in February 1993.  This decline was
    offset by the addition of three Incredible Universe stores.
    The first two Incredible Universe stores were opened in the
    fall of 1992, and the third was added in the fall of 1993.
    Shipments to InterTAN decreased for calendar year 1993 as
    compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  On a
    comparable store basis, Radio Shack's sales increased
    slightly during the year ended December 31, 1993, as compared
    to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  A moderate increase
    in sales of Radio Shack's core business was offset by a
    decline in sales of personal computers through the Radio
    Shack division.

       The decrease in Radio Shack's computer business reflects
    the impact of sharply lower pricing in response to
    competitive pressures in the marketplace.  The changing
    dynamics of the personal computer business had a significant
    impact on Radio Shack's performance during 1993 and fiscal
    1992, and to a lesser extent in 1994.  A combination of
    shifts in competitive retail distribution to superstores and
    telemarketing combined with rapidly declining prices has
    taken the computer category from approximately 17.0% of Radio
    Shack's sales with a gross profit of approximately 29.0% in
    the year ended June 30, 1992, to approximately 12.0% of sales
    and a gross profit of approximately 13.7% for the year ended
    December 31, 1994.  Radio Shack's extensive assortment of
    electronic parts, accessories and specialty items
    differentiates it from other consumer electronics retailers
    in the marketplace.  The table below shows the breakdown by
    major category of Radio Shack sales.

    GROSS PROFIT
       Gross profit as a percent of sales declined in 1994 to
    39.0% from the 1993 level of 41.9%.  This decrease reflects
    the continued expansion of Tandy's lower gross margin retail
    formats.  During calendar year 1994, Computer City and
    Incredible Universe represented 31.7% of total sales and
    operating revenues compared to 18.6% of the 1993 total.
    Offsetting the mix of business shift within Tandy are the
    increasing gross margins in Radio Shack in calendar 1994,
    which continue to benefit from a lower percentage of sales
    related to low margin computer equipment and a higher
    percentage associated with the sale of higher gross margin
    categories including parts, accessories and consumer
    electronics.  Management anticipates that Tandy's
    consolidated gross profit percentage will continue to decline
    as the effects of the Computer City and Incredible Universe
    expansions are increasingly reflected in the gross profit
    mix.

       Gross profit as a percent of sales and operating revenues
    for the year ended December 31, 1993 was 41.9% as compared to
    43.5% for the six months ended December 31, 1992, and 47.2%
    for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  The decline, in
    part, reflects the faster growth of new high-volume formats
    such as Computer City and Incredible Universe which have
    inherently lower gross margins than Radio Shack stores.
    Combined Computer City and Incredible Universe sales
    contributed 18.6%, 8.9% and 2.6% to consolidated sales in the
    year ended December 31, 1993, the six months ended December
    31, 1992 and the year ended June 30, 1992, respectively.
    Competitive pressures in name brand electronics retailing
    decreased Tandy Name Brand's gross margins in each of the
    periods ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 and June 30, 1992.
    Additionally, gross margins were impacted in the Tandy Name
    Brand units by the increasing percentage of sales related to
    the lower margin computer category.

    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
       Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") as a
    percent of sales and operating revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 1994 declined from the year ended December 31,
    1993, as well as from the year ended June 30, 1992 and from
    the six months ended December 31, 1992.  The accompanying
    table summarizes the breakdown of various components of SG&A
    and their related percentage of sales and operating revenues.
    The lower SG&A percentage reflects the lower costs, relative
    to net sales and operating revenues, of the Company's newer
    retail formats, as well as the operating costs achieved
    through cost reduction programs.

       Specific items impacting year-to-year comparisons are: (1)
    for the year ended December 31, 1993, foreign currency
    transactions include a $1,796,000 realized loss on the sale
    of the cellular joint ventures; (2) other expenses in
    calendar 1993 are net of a gain of $6,047,000 on the sale of
    the cellular joint ventures, and (3) in fiscal year 1992, the
    sale of a Japanese subsidiary, the assets of which were
    primarily real estate, resulted in the recording of a gain of
    $12,093,000 in other SG&A and a foreign currency gain of
    $6,894,000.  The Company's exposure to foreign currency
    fluctuations has decreased significantly with the divestiture
    of the European marketing operations.

       Although payroll and commissions expense has increased in
    dollars, this cost has decreased as a percent of sales and
    operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 1994 as
    compared to the year ended December 31, 1993 and the fiscal
    year ended June 30, 1992.  This is due to the increase in
    Computer City and Incredible Universe sales as a percentage
    of total sales and operating revenues from 2.6% in fiscal
    1992 to 31.7% in 1994; these divisions have an inherently
    lower salary structure when compared to Radio Shack.  In
    addition, Computer City payroll expense as a percent of
    Computer City sales has decreased from 1993 to 1994, while
    that of the other retail divisions has remained approximately
    the same from year to year.

       Advertising costs have decreased as a percent of sales and
    operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 1994 as
    compared to the year ended December 31, 1993 and the fiscal
    year ended June 30, 1992.  Management has focused its efforts
    on more efficient advertising methods for Radio Shack
    utilizing the Company's database of customer activity to
    reduce costs while maintaining market awareness.  Advertising
    costs increased in dollars compared to the prior year as new
    Computer City and Incredible Universe stores opened and Radio
    Shack shifted its marketing program to electronic media.  The
    Company currently spends approximately 30% of its advertising
    funds for television and radio commercials, compared to 20%
    in previous years.  Radio Shack's advertising spots have been
    shifted from sports-related events to prime-time shows in
    order to reach a broader audience.

       Rent expense has increased slightly in dollars but
    decreased as a percent of sales during the year ended
    December 31, 1994 as compared to the year ended December 31,
    1993.  The increase in rent expense is due a net increase of
    45 Radio Shack stores and the addition of 29 Computer City
    stores and six Incredible Universe stores.  Incredible
    Universe and Computer City formats typically have lower rent,
    as a percent of sales, than Tandy overall.  As a percent of
    sales, rent decreased from fiscal 1992 in comparison with
    that for the year ended December 31, 1993 resulting in part
    from Computer City's lower rent to sales ratio.

       Other SG&A costs have increased over that of the prior
    year due to several factors, including an increase in
    discount fees paid to third party bank cards because of both
    increased sales in the Computer City and Incredible Universe
    formats and an increase in credit card sales as a percent of
    sales.  Further, Radio Shack merchandise repair expenses
    increases of $8,261,000 primarily reflected an increase in
    extended service plan sales.  The change in other SG&A also
    reflects the $6,047,000 gain noted above on the 1993 sale of
    the Company's interests in two cellular telephone
    manufacturing joint ventures and an increase in legal and
    attorney fees of $4,671,000 in 1994.

       The Company's credit operations have been successful in
    supporting sales of the retail operations.  Private label
    credit cards represented 35% of credit sales for the year
    ended December 31, 1994, 34% for the year ended December 31,
    1993, 36% for the six months ended December 31, 1992 and 43%
    in fiscal 1992.  This decline in the percentage from 1992
    results from increased sales through the Computer City and
    Incredible Universe stores which have a lower percentage of
    private label credit card usage.  Expenses associated with
    the credit card operations, which are included in SG&A
    expense, have decreased as a percent of sales due to a
    decrease in credit losses reflecting a stronger economy.  As
    discussed more fully in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, the Company has sold its Computer City
    and Incredible Universe private label credit card portfolios
    and expects in the first half of 1995 to sell its Radio Shack
    and McDuff private label credit card portfolios.  Once
    completed, the Company will no longer incur bad debt expense
    or servicing costs associated with its private label credit
    cards.  In 1995, the Company will begin to receive a fee from
    the unrelated third party financer of its private label
    credit card portfolio balance for the generation of normal
    interest bearing accounts, and will pay a fee for the
    generation of special purpose promotional accounts, such as
    "zero percent interest for twelve months" programs.  See Note
    3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further discussion of the Company's pending disposition of
    its credit operations.

    </TABLE>

    DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
       Depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of
    sales and operating revenues decreased slightly in the year
    ended December 31, 1994 as compared with the year ended
    December 31, 1993 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.
    The dollar amount of depreciation and amortization expense
    for the year ended December 31, 1994 increased 6% over the
    dollar amount for the year ended December 31, 1993 and 14%
    over that for the year ended June 30, 1992.  The increase is
    due to additional capital expenditures related to the six
    Incredible Universe stores added in 1994, and the addition of
    29 Computer City stores this year.  Three Incredible Universe
    stores and 25 Computer City stores were added from June 30,
    1992 to December 31, 1993, thereby increasing depreciation
    and amortization from fiscal 1992 to calendar 1993.

    NET INTEREST (INCOME)/EXPENSE
       Net interest income was $48,565,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 1994, $25,831,000 for the year ended December
    31, 1993 and $24,245,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30,
    1992.  Interest income in all three years is primarily
    attributable to the Company's credit card operations;
    however, in fiscal 1994 the Company also received interest
    income from the IRS reflecting the settlement of outstanding
    tax issues of approximately $9,582,000, and interest income
    earned on notes receivable from AST Research Inc. and
    InterTAN which approximated $5,724,000 and $8,280,000,
    respectively.  Increased short-term investments resulted from
    proceeds received from the divestiture of discontinued
    manufacturing and marketing operations, as well as from cash
    provided by operating activities.  Interest income as it
    relates to the AST Research Inc. and InterTAN notes
    receivable is expected to continue in fiscal 1995.  See
    further discussion on notes receivable in the "InterTAN
    Update" and "Discontinued Operations" sections of
    Management's Discussion and Analysis below.

       Interest income from credit operations was $46,868,000 for
    the year ended December 31, 1994, $57,401,000 for the year
    ended December 31, 1993 and $62,307,000 for the fiscal year
    ended June 30, 1992.  Interest income from the credit card
    company has decreased in the last three years as a result of
    increased use of certain special sales promotions and
    marketing initiatives, some of which provide for no interest
    charges for specified initial periods.  The decline in
    average credit card receivables results from increased
    payments from credit customers reflecting the overall
    improvement in the economy and a desire by consumers to shift
    debt to lower interest rate instruments.  Due to the December
    1994 sale of the Computer City and Incredible Universe credit
    card portfolios, the Company will no longer include any
    interest income from these portfolios.  Since the sale, at
    net book value, of the Radio Shack and McDuff portfolios is
    contingent upon and subject to regulatory and rating agency
    approvals, the Company will continue to include interest
    income from these portfolios until final approval is received
    and the sale is completed.  This sale is expected to close in
    the first half of 1995.

       The decrease in interest expense for the year ended
    December 31, 1994 as compared to the years ended December 31,
    1993 and June 30, 1992 is due to the decrease of total debt
    and lower U.S. interest rates.  Short-term debt has decreased
    41% and long-term debt has decreased 18% from December 31,
    1993 due to the repayment of debt such as subordinated
    debentures, medium-term notes and commercial paper.  The
    Company expects overall interest expense to increase in 1995
    as compared to interest expense in 1994.  As the Company
    receives cash proceeds from the sale of its credit
    operations, it will apply a significant portion of such
    proceeds to the repayment of short-term debt, for store
    expansion and to fund its 12,500,000 share repurchase
    program, of which approximately 5,000,000 shares had been
    repurchased as of December 31, 1994.

    PROVISION FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING
       In December 1994, the Company adopted a business
    restructuring plan to close or convert 233 of the 306 Tandy
    Name Brand stores.  Closed stores will include 151
    VideoConcepts, 30 McDuff mall stores and 19 McDuff
    Supercenters.  Thirty-three other mall stores or McDuff
    Supercenters will be converted to Radio Shack or Computer
    City Express stores.  It is anticipated that a majority of
    these planned closures will be completed by the end of the
    first quarter of 1995.  Approximately 57 McDuff Supercenters
    and 16 The Edge in Electronics stores will remain open and
    will become part of the Specialty Retail Group of Radio
    Shack.  A pre-tax charge of $89,071,000 was taken in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 related to the closing and
    conversion of these stores.  The components of the
    restructuring charge and an analysis of the amounts charged
    against the reserve are outlined in a table in Note 4 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

       The lease obligations, termination benefits and conversion
    of 33 stores will require cash outlays, most of which are
    expected to be made during 1995.  The cash outlays will be
    financed by operating cash flows.  Management anticipates
    that pre-tax operating losses during the period of store
    closures will approximate $6,000,000 to $8,000,000
    (unaudited).

       Sales and operating revenues associated with the closing
    of Tandy Name Brand stores were approximately $261,990,000
    (unaudited) and $271,914,000 (unaudited) for calendar years
    1994 and 1993, respectively, and operating losses
    approximated $18,125,000 (unaudited) and $15,342,000
    (unaudited) for calendar 1994 and 1993, respectively.  During
    the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, sales and operating
    revenues and operating losses from the closing stores were
    approximately $254,531,000 (unaudited) and $10,169,000
    (unaudited), respectively.  The results of the closing stores
    for the six months ended December 31, 1992 are not presented
    because, due to the seasonal nature of the stores'
    operations, such results would not be comparable to any of
    the twelve-month results for the other periods presented.  In
    conjunction with this restructuring, 1,425 (unaudited)
    employees will be terminated, most of which are store
    employees and managers.  As of December 31, 1994, no
    employees had been terminated and, accordingly, no
    termination benefits had been paid.

       The Company adopted a plan resulting in business
    restructuring charges during the six months ended December
    31, 1992 designed to improve the Company's competitiveness
    and future profitability.  The pre-tax charge of $48,000,000
    related primarily to the closing of 110 of the then 432 Tandy
    Name Brand stores, mainly McDuff Supercenters in major market
    areas and, to a lesser extent, the elimination of certain
    product lines.  Some product lines were reduced or eliminated
    after consideration of competitive factors and market trends.
    These stores were closed in the first quarter of 1993.

    GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS AND EXTENDED SERVICE
      CONTRACTS
       In December 1994 the Company entered into an agreement
    with SPS Transaction Services, Inc., a majority-owned
    subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Company ("SPS") to sell
    its Computer City and Incredible Universe private label
    credit card portfolios without recourse.  As a result of the
    agreement, in which Tandy received cash of $85,764,000 and
    will receive a deferred payment of $179,777,000, the Company
    recognized a gain of $35,708,000 in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Income. The deferred payment
    amount does not bear interest.  Principal will be paid
    monthly with the total principal amount of $179,777,000 due
    over a twelve month period.  The Company has discounted the
    deferred payment by $3,477,000 to yield approximately 5% over
    the twelve month payout period.  As a result, the discounted
    deferred payment amount of $176,300,000 is classified as
    current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    December 31, 1994.  The Company also signed a letter of
    intent to sell its Radio Shack and McDuff private label
    credit card portfolios at net book value and without recourse
    to SPS in 1995, including the rights to the securitized
    accounts (see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements).  The agreement for the sale of McDuff and Radio
    Shack portfolios was completed in January 1995, subject only
    to regulatory and rating agency approval which should be
    forthcoming in the first half of 1995.  Tandy anticipates
    receiving approximately $290,000,000 (unaudited) cash and a
    deferred payment approximating $80,000,000 (unaudited), on
    terms similar to the deferred payment arrangement mentioned
    above.

       Tandy National Bank (the "Bank"), a limited purpose
    nationally chartered credit card bank, was established on May
    11, 1994.  The Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tandy, was
    created to operate the consumer credit card programs for
    Tandy.  All new accounts approved after May 12, 1994 were
    originated and owned by the Bank.  After the Company's sale
    of the private label credit card portfolios, the Bank will
    cease operations.

       Effective December 1994, the Company transferred all of
    its existing obligations with respect to extended service
    contracts in force at December 31, 1994, with the exception
    of certain contracts aggregating approximately $7,734,000, to
    an unrelated third party.  The unrelated third party
    contractually assumed all of the Company's legal obligations
    and risk of future loss pursuant to the extended service
    contracts in exchange for $75,059,000, of which $70,702,000
    was paid in December 1994 and $4,357,000 was paid in February
    1995.  As a result, the Company has recognized a gain of
    $55,729,000 associated with this transaction in its
    accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  The Company
    will continue to provide repair services to customers who
    tender products pursuant to the extended service contracts on
    a non-exclusive basis.  The unrelated third party will pay
    the Company competitive market rates for repairs on products
    tendered pursuant to the extended service contracts.

       The Company will continue to sell extended service
    contracts on behalf of the unrelated third party and will
    receive a commission upon the sale.  The commission will be
    recognized as commission income at the time of sale.

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
       The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31,
    1994 was 37.6% and was 37.1% for the year ended December 31,
    1993.  The higher effective tax rates for these two years as
    compared to 36.2% for the year ended June 30, 1992 reflects
    the impact of the increase of the federal tax rate to 35%
    from 34% which was effective January 1, 1993.  The effective
    tax rate for the six-month period ended December 31, 1992 was
    34.2%.  This lower effective rate reflects the successful
    resolution of certain IRS examinations during the period.

       The IRS Dallas field office is reviewing the Company's
    1987-1989 tax returns.  The review in Dallas could lead to
    referral to the IRS National office.  The resolution of this
    matter could result in additional taxes and interest to the
    Company related to the spin-off of InterTAN and raises
    questions about the private letter rulings issued by the IRS
    regarding the spin-off and certain other tax matters.
    Although aggregate additional taxes involved in these
    transactions could potentially range from $0 to $46 million,
    based on the advice of the Company's independent tax
    advisors, the Company believes it would prevail if any tax
    litigation had to be instituted.  Any ultimate tax assessment
    would also include interest.  In any event, the Company
    believes the ultimate resolution would have no material
    impact on the Company's financial condition.

       Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for
    Income Taxes", which the Company adopted January 1, 1993, is
    discussed in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
       On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy adopted
    a formal plan of divestiture under which the Company would
    sell its computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the
    O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ("O'Sullivan") ready-to-assemble
    furniture manufacturing and related marketing business, the
    Memtek Products division and the Lika printed circuit board
    business.

         Computer Manufacturing.  The Company closed the sale of
       the computer manufacturing and marketing businesses to AST
       Research, Inc. ("AST") on July 13, 1993.  In accordance
       with the terms of the definitive agreement between Tandy
       and AST, Tandy received $15,000,000 upon closing of the
       sale.  The balance of the purchase price of $90,000,000
       is payable by a promissory note.  The principal amount of
       this promissory note is payable by July 12, 1996; interest
       is accrued and paid annually.  The interest rate on the
       promissory note is currently 4.94% per annum and is
       adjusted annually, not to exceed 5% per annum.  The terms
       of the promissory note stipulate that the outstanding
       principal balance may be paid at maturity at AST's option
       in cash or the common stock of AST.  However, at Tandy's
       option not more than 50% of the initial principal balance
       may be paid in common stock of AST.  The promissory note
       is supported by a standby letter of credit in the amount
       of the lesser of $100,000,000 or 70% of the outstanding
       principal amount of the promissory note.  At December 31,
       1994, the standby letter of credit approximated
       $67,704,000.

          In October 1993, the Company sold its computer
       marketing operations in France to AST, together with
       certain other multimedia assets and additional Swedish
       inventory, in return for an increase in the principal
       amount of the promissory note described above to
       $96,700,000.  The Company has discounted this note by
       $2,000,000 and the discount will be recognized as interest
       using the effective interest rate method over the life of
       the note.

          Memtek Products.  On November 10, 1993, the Company
       executed a definitive agreement with Hanny Magnetics
       (B.V.I.) Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation
       ("Hanny"), to purchase certain assets of the Company's
       Memtek Products operations, including the license
       agreement with Memorex Telex, N.V. for the use of the
       Memorex trademark on licensed consumer electronics
       products.  This sale closed on December 16, 1993.  Hanny
       is a subsidiary of Hanny Magnetics (Holdings) Limited, a
       Bermuda corporation, listed on the Hong Kong Stock
       Exchange.  Proceeds from this sale aggregated $69,602,000.
       The $7,102,000 receivable which remained at December 31,
       1993 was paid in 1994.

          O'Sullivan Industries.  On January 27, 1994 the Company
       announced that it had reached an agreement with the
       underwriters to sell all the common stock of O'Sullivan
       Industries Holdings, Inc., the parent company of
       O'Sullivan, to the public at $22 per share.  The net
       proceeds realized by Tandy in the initial public offering,
       together with a $40,000,000 cash dividend from O'Sullivan,
       approximated $350,000,000.  The initial public offering
       closed on February 2, 1994.

          Tandy has recognized income of approximately
       $4,399,000, net of tax, during the year ended December 31,
       1994, pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit
       Reimbursement Agreement between Tandy and O'Sullivan under
       which Tandy receives payments from O'Sullivan
       approximating the federal tax benefit that O'Sullivan
       realizes from the increased tax basis of its assets
       resulting from the initial public offering.  The higher
       tax basis increases O'Sullivan's tax deductions and,
       accordingly, reduces income taxes payable by O'Sullivan.
       These payments will be made over a 15-year time period and
       are contingent upon O'Sullivan's taxable income each year.
       The Company is recognizing these payments as additional
       sale proceeds and gain in the year in which the payments
       become due and payable to the Company pursuant to the Tax
       Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement Agreement.  The
       additional gain is recorded as a reduction of SG&A expense
       in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

          Lika.  On October 11, 1994, Tandy sold the assets used
       in its Lika(R) printed circuit board division to Viktron
       Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership.  The
       proceeds from the sale and liquidation of assets
       approximated $16,380,000 which included $7,754,000 in
       cash, proceeds from liquidation of retained assets of
       $5,594,000 and secured promissory notes for $3,032,000.

       In connection with the computer manufacturing sale, the
    Memtek Products sale and the Lika sale, the Company agreed to
    retain certain liabilities primarily relating to warranty
    obligations on products sold prior to the sale.  Management
    believes that accrued reserves, as reflected on its December
    31, 1994 balance sheet, are adequate to cover estimated
    future warranty obligations for the products.

    </TABLE>

       Tandy's cash flow and liquidity, in management's opinion,
    remains strong.  During the year ended December 31, 1994,
    cash provided by operations was $268,938,000 as compared to
    $322,294,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993.  The
    decreased cash flow from operations was due partially to the
    financing of receivables and inventories related to the
    expansion of Computer City and Incredible Universe store
    chains.  The increase of $261,071,000 in cash used to fund
    accounts receivable was due primarily to the increase in
    Tandy Credit receivables related to increased retail sales by
    Computer City and Incredible Universe and the use of certain
    special sales promotions and marketing initiatives, some of
    which provide for no interest charges for specified initial
    periods.  Inventory required $156,129,000 more cash in 1994
    than in 1993.  The increase in inventory during 1994 related
    to new store openings and increases in average inventory to
    ensure in-stock positions throughout the Christmas selling
    season.  Partially offsetting the cash used to finance
    receivables and inventory were the sale of the Computer City
    and Incredible Universe private label credit card portfolios
    which provided cash of $85,764,000 as well as increases in
    accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes which
    provided $184,017,000 more cash in 1994 than in 1993.  The
    1994 increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and
    income taxes is net of the cash expended, approximating
    $70,702,000, associated with the transfer of the legal
    obligation and risk of loss for existing extended service
    contracts to an unrelated third party.

       During the year ended December 31, 1993, cash provided by
    operations was $322,294,000 as compared to $146,782,000 for
    the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  The increased cash flow
    from operations in calendar 1993 compared to fiscal year
    ended June 30, 1992 was due partially to receivables which
    provided $30,133,000 in cash in 1993 but used $121,719,000 in
    1992.  The decline in accounts receivable in 1993 versus 1992
    was due to the liquidation of receivables related to the
    divested operations and lower consumer receivables related to
    the Company's private label credit card portfolio.  The
    latter reason reflects consumers' desires to liquidate debt
    with higher interest rates and the overall improved economy.
    Inventory required less cash in calendar 1993 than in fiscal
    1992.

       Investing activities involved capital expenditures
    primarily for retail expansion totaling $180,559,000 for the
    year ended December 31, 1994, $129,287,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 1993, and $127,495,000 for the year ended June
    30, 1992.  Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and
    equipment in 1994 resulted primarily from a sale-leaseback
    transaction involving certain Incredible Universe stores
    which netted the Company $52,719,000 in cash.  Proceeds
    received from the sale of divested operations totaled
    $359,004,000 and $111,988,000 during the years ended December
    31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  See "Discontinued
    Operations".  Investing activities in 1993 also included
    $31,663,000 for the purchase of InterTAN's bank debt and the
    extension and funding of a working capital line of credit.
    See "InterTAN Update" for further information.  Future store
    expansions and refurbishments and other capital expenditures
    are expected to approximate $180,000,000 to $200,000,000 per
    year over the next two years and will be funded primarily
    from available cash, cash flow from operations and proceeds
    from the sale of the private label credit card portfolios.

       Purchases of treasury stock used cash of $275,415,000,
    $27,650,000 and $527,773,000 in 1994, 1993 and fiscal 1992,
    respectively.  Increases in treasury stock purchases in 1994
    related primarily to the share repurchase program.  See
    "Capital Structure and Financial Condition" for further
    discussion.  Financing activities in fiscal 1992 included the
    February 1992 sale of $2.14 Depositary Shares of the
    Company's Series C Preferred Equity Redemption Convertible
    Stock ("PERCS") for $429,982,000 and the subsequent purchase
    of common stock with such proceeds.  Sales of treasury stock
    to the Company's Stock Purchase Program generated cash of
    $41,579,000, $42,067,000 and $49,590,000 in 1994, 1993, and
    fiscal 1992, respectively.  Dividends paid, net of tax, in
    1994, 1993 and fiscal 1992 amounted to $74,512,000,
    $74,873,000 and $56,132,000, respectively.  The increase in
    dividends since fiscal 1992 is mainly the result of dividends
    paid on the PERCS which were issued in fiscal 1992.  As a
    result of the Company calling its PERCS in March 1995, the
    Company will eliminate its dividend payment to the PERCS of
    approximately $32,000,000.  However, it will pay upon
    conversion a dividend to the PERCS shareholders of
    approximately $4,815,000.  Preferred stock dividends are
    expected to exceed $11,000,000 in 1995.  The Company plans to
    fund the preferred stock and common stock dividends with
    available cash and cash flow from operations, as well as from
    the proceeds from the sale of its credit card portfolios.

       In 1994 and 1993, the Company decreased short-term
    borrowings by $110,393,000 and $46,885,000, respectively, and
    increased short-term borrowings by $57,533,000 in fiscal
    1992.  The consistent reduction in short-term borrowings has
    been funded primarily by proceeds from the sale of divested
    operations and cash provided by operations.  The Company's
    primary source of short-term debt, for which borrowings and
    repayments have been presented net in the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows, consists of short-term seasonal
    bank debt and commercial paper.  The commercial paper matures
    within ninety days as does the short-term seasonal bank debt.

    CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
       The Company's balance sheet and financial condition
    continue to be strong.  The Company's available borrowing
    facilities as of December 31, 1994 are detailed in Note 9 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

       In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, the Company issued
    150,000 PERCS shares and used the proceeds of this offering
    to purchase $430,000,000 of the Company's common stock for
    treasury.  The PERCS are discussed further in Note 18 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  On January 23,
    1995, Tandy announced that it had exercised its right to call
    the issued and outstanding PERCS for conversion on March 10,
    1995 prior to the mandatory conversion date of April 15,
    1995.  To complete the redemption, the Company will issue
    from treasury stock approximately 11,816,000 shares of Tandy
    Corporation common stock.

       On August 1, 1994, the Company announced that its Board of
    Directors authorized management to purchase up to 7,500,000
    shares of its common stock in addition to shares required for
    employee plans.  On December 30, 1994, the Board of Directors
    authorized management to increase the share repurchase
    program to 12,500,000 shares.  Purchases will be made from
    time to time in the open market, and it is expected that
    funding of the program will come from existing cash,
    short-term debt and proceeds from the sale of the credit card
    portfolios.  At December 31, 1994, approximately 5,000,000
    shares had been repurchased under this program.

       The Company's issue of 10% subordinated debentures due
    June 30, 1994 was called by the Company on February 23, 1994
    for redemption on April 1, 1994.  The redemption was at 100%
    of face value or $32,431,000.

       The revolving credit backup facilities to Tandy's
    commercial paper program were renewed in May 1994.  These
    facilities are to be used only if maturing commercial paper
    cannot be repaid due to an inability to sell new commercial
    paper.  This agreement is composed of two facilities--one for
    $200,000,000 expiring May 1995 and another $200,000,000
    facility expiring in May 1997.  Annual commitment fees for
    the facilities are 2/25 of 1% per annum and 1/8 of 1% per
    annum, respectively, whether used or unused.

       In fiscal 1991, the Company filed a shelf registration for
    $500,000,000, of which $400,000,000 was designated for
    medium-term notes, and Tandy Credit Corporation increased its
    medium-term note program by $200,000,000.  During fiscal
    1991, short-term debt was refinanced by the issuance of
    $155,500,000 in medium-term notes.  Tandy's medium-term notes
    outstanding at December 31, 1994 totaled $73,044,000 compared
    to $125,479,000 at December 31, 1993.

       The total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 17.1%, 22.8%,
    27.3% and 23.4% at December 31, 1994, December 31, 1993,
    December 31, 1992 and June 30, 1992, respectively.  This
    debt-to-capitalization ratio should improve further in fiscal
    1995 due to the cash proceeds from the sales of the credit
    operations being used to retire debt, fund the repurchase of
    outstanding common shares into treasury shares and for other
    purposes.

       Management believes that the Company's present borrowing
    capacity is greater than the established credit lines and
    long-term debt in place.  Management also believes that the
    Company's cash flow from operations, cash and short-term
    investments and its available borrowing facilities are more
    than adequate to fund planned store expansion and to meet
    debt service and dividend requirements and to fund its share
    repurchase program.

    INFLATION
       Inflation has not significantly impacted the Company over
    the past three years.  Management does not expect inflation
    to have a significant impact on operations in the foreseeable
    future unless global situations substantially affect the
    world economy.

    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
       The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    issued Statement of Position 93-7, "Reporting on Advertising
    Costs," in December 1993.  The statement generally requires
    all advertising costs to be expensed in the period in which
    the costs are incurred or the first time the advertising
    takes place, and is effective for years beginning after June
    15, 1994.  The statement is not anticipated to have any
    material effect on the results of operations or financial
    condition of the Company.

    SALE OF JOINT VENTURE INTEREST
       During the quarter ended September 30, 1993, the Company
    entered into definitive agreements with Nokia Corporation
    ("Nokia") to sell the Company's interests in two cellular
    telephone manufacturing joint ventures with Nokia, TMC
    Company Ltd. located in Masan, Korea, and TNC Company located
    in Fort Worth, Texas.  Pursuant to the terms of the
    definitive agreements, the Company received an aggregate of
    approximately $31,700,000 for its interests in these joint
    ventures.  The Company also entered into a three-year
    Preferred Supplier Agreement pursuant to which it has agreed
    to purchase from Nokia substantially all of Radio Shack's
    requirements for cellular telephones at prevailing
    competitive market prices at the time of the purchase.  These
    operations were not part of the overall divestment plan
    adopted in June 1993 by the Company's Board of Directors;
    therefore, the gain on the sale and their results of
    operations were not included in discontinued operations.

    INTERTAN UPDATE
       InterTAN, the former foreign retail operations of Tandy,
    was spun off to Tandy stockholders as a tax-free dividend in
    fiscal 1987.  Under the merchandise purchase terms of the
    original distribution agreement, InterTAN could purchase on
    payment terms products sold or secured by Tandy.  A&A
    International ("A&A"), a subsidiary of Tandy, was the
    exclusive purchasing agent for products originating in the
    Far East for InterTAN.

       On July 16, 1993 InterTAN had an account payable to Tandy
    of approximately $17,000,000, of which $7,600,000 was in
    default.  InterTAN's outstanding purchase orders for
    merchandise placed under the distribution agreement with
    Tandy, but not yet shipped, totaled approximately
    $44,000,000.  Because InterTAN had defaulted, on July 16
    Tandy terminated the merchandise purchase terms of the
    distribution agreement and the license agreements.  Tandy
    offered InterTAN interim license agreements which expired
    July 22, 1993, unless extended.  The agreements were extended
    on July 23, 1993.

       On July 30, 1993 Trans World Electronics, Inc. ("Trans
    World"), a subsidiary of Tandy, reached agreement with
    InterTAN's banking syndicate to buy approximately $42,000,000
    of InterTAN's debt at a negotiated, discounted price.  The
    closing of this purchase occurred on August 5, 1993, at which
    time Tandy resumed limited shipments to InterTAN and granted
    a series of short-term, interim licenses pending the
    execution of new license and merchandise agreements.  The
    debt purchased from the banks has been restructured into a
    seven-year note with interest of 8.64% due semiannually
    beginning February 25, 1994 and semiannual principal payments
    beginning February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).  Trans
    World provided approximately $10,000,000 in working capital
    and trade credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the working
    capital loan (the "Series B" note) of 8.11% is due
    semiannually beginning February 25, 1994 with the principal
    due in full on August 25, 1996.  Trans World also has
    received warrants with a five-year term exercisable for
    approximately 1,450,000 shares of InterTAN common stock at an
    exercise price of $6.618 per share.  As required by an
    agreement with Tandy, InterTAN has registered the warrants
    under the Securities Act of 1933.  At December 31, 1994,
    InterTAN's common stock price, as quoted in the Wall Street
                                                    -----------

    warrants at December 31, 1994 approximates $2,500,000.

       In addition to the bank debt purchased by Trans World and
    the working capital loan, InterTAN's obligations to Trans
    World included two additional notes for approximately
    $23,665,000 (the "Series C" note) and $24,037,000 (the
    "Series D" note) with interest rates of 7.5% and 8%,
    respectively.  The notes represented the restructuring of
    InterTAN accounts payable for merchandise already shipped and
    required monthly interest payments.  All principal and
    interest on the Series C note was paid in full by December
    31, 1993.  The Series D note was paid in full during the
    first quarter of 1994.  All of Tandy's debt from InterTAN is
    secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of
    InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K.

       A new merchandise agreement was reached with InterTAN in
    October 1993 which requires future purchase orders to be
    backed by letters of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license
    agreements provide for a future royalty to Tandy.  InterTAN
    had obligations for purchase orders outstanding for
    merchandise ordered by A&A for InterTAN but not yet shipped
    totaling approximately $24,705,000 at December 31, 1994.

       InterTAN has increased its bank revolving credit facility
    with the new banking syndicate to Canadian $60,000,000 (U.S.
    $42,774,000 equivalent at December 31, 1994).  In the case of
    InterTAN's default on the bank credit line, Tandy will, at
    the option of InterTAN's new banking syndicate, purchase
    InterTAN's inventory and related accounts receivable at 50%
    of their net book value, up to the amount of outstanding bank
    loans, but not to exceed Canadian $60,000,000.  In that
    event, Tandy could foreclose on its first priority lien on
    InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K.  If Tandy fails to
    purchase the inventory and related accounts receivable of
    InterTAN from the banking syndicate, the syndicate upon
    notice to Tandy and expiration of time, can foreclose upon
    InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K. ahead of Tandy.  The
    inventory repurchase agreement between InterTAN's banking
    syndicate and Tandy has been amended and restated to reflect
    the foregoing.

       As of December 31, 1994 InterTAN owed Tandy an aggregate
    of $39,965,000, net of discount.  The current portion of the
    obligation approximates $8,707,000 and the non-current
    portion approximates $31,258,000.  In 1994 Tandy recognized
    $3,855,000 in accretion of discount on the note receivable
    from InterTAN which resulted from the purchase of the bank
    debt at a discounted price.  Accretion of this discount is
    based on the effective interest rate method.  Tandy
    recognized sales to and commission income from InterTAN of
    approximately $19,764,000 and interest income of $8,280,000
    during fiscal 1994.  During the year ended December 31, 1993,
    Tandy recognized approximately $93,315,000 of sales to
    InterTAN and interest income of $3,085,000.  Tandy's sales to
    InterTAN totaled $90,130,000 during the six months ended
    December 31, 1992 and $171,126,000 during fiscal 1992.

       A&A will continue as the exclusive purchasing agent for
    InterTAN in the Far East on a commission basis.  Commencing
    in March 1994, only the purchasing agent commission and sales
    by Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN were recorded as
    sales and operating revenues.  InterTAN purchases from third
    parties through A&A are no longer recorded as sales,
    reflecting the arrangement under the new merchandise
    agreement.  Accordingly, sales by Tandy to InterTAN in 1994
    are considerably lower than in prior years, however, the
    earned income relating thereto was not materially different.

       Through February 1995 InterTAN has met all of its payment
    obligations to Tandy.  In addition, its operations have
    improved in fiscal 1995 as evidenced by its published net
    income for the six months ended December 31, 1994
    approximating $17,704,000 or $1.11 per fully diluted share as
    opposed to net income of $4,567,000 or $0.49 per fully
    diluted share for the same period in the prior year.  As a
    result, nothing has come to the attention of management which
    would indicate that InterTAN would not be able to continue to
    meet its payment obligations pursuant to the debt agreements
    with Tandy.

       Canadian tax authorities are reviewing InterTAN's Canadian
    subsidiary's 1987-89 tax returns.  The Company cannot
    determine whether the ultimate resolution of that review will
    have an effect on InterTAN's ability to meet its obligations
    to Tandy, but at the present, the Company believes that the
    ultimate resolution of this review will not impair InterTAN's
    ability to meet its obligations to Tandy.

    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ..........   34-55

       Separate financial statements of Tandy Corporation have
    been omitted because Tandy is primarily an operating company
    and the amount of restricted net assets of consolidated and
    unconsolidated subsidiaries and Tandy's equity in
    undistributed earnings of 50% or less-owned companies
    accounted for by the equity method are not significant.  All
    subsidiaries of Tandy Corporation are included in the
    consolidated financial statements.  Financial statements of
    50% or less-owned companies have been omitted because they do
    not, considered individually or in the aggregate, constitute
    a significant subsidiary.

       The financial statement schedules should be read in
    conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.  All
    other schedules have been omitted because they are not
    applicable, not required or the information is included in
    the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

    To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
    Tandy Corporation

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed
    in the accompanying index on page 27 present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of Tandy
    Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December
    31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the two years in the period
    ended December 31, 1994, the six months ended December 31,
    1992, and for the year ended June 30, 1992 in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company's
    management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
    these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted
    our audits of these statements in accordance with generally
    accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
    evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
    used and significant estimates made by management, and
    evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
    opinion expressed above.

    As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    income taxes in 1993.

    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    Tandy Corporation and Subsidiaries

    NOTE 1-DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
       Tandy Corporation ("Tandy" or the "Company") is engaged in
    consumer electronics retailing including the retail sale of
    personal computers.  Radio Shack is the largest of Tandy's
    retail store systems with company-owned stores and
    dealer/franchise outlets.  Tandy also operates the Computer
    City and Incredible Universe store chains.  Tandy Name Brand
    includes McDuff Electronics mall stores and Supercenters,
    VideoConcepts mall stores and The Edge in Electronics
    boutique stores.  On December 30, 1994, the Company adopted a
    formal plan to close 233 Tandy Name Brand stores, and as a
    result of the closings, the Tandy Name Brand Retail Group
    will be dissolved in 1995.  The remaining 73 Tandy Name Brand
    stores will be transferred to the Radio Shack division.
    Additionally, Tandy continues to operate certain related
    retail support groups and consumer electronics manufacturing
    businesses.

    NOTE 2-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
       PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of Tandy and its wholly owned
    subsidiaries including its credit and insurance
    subsidiaries.  Investments in 20% to 50% owned companies are
    accounted for on the equity method.  The manufacturing and
    marketing operatins included in the divestment plan have
    been accounted for as discontinued operations.  See Note 21
    for further information relating to discontinued operations.
    Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in
    consolidation.

       CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR:  On January 10, 1993, the Board of
    Directors authorized the fiscal year of Tandy to be changed
    from June 30 to December 31 and as of December 31, 1992 this
    change was made.  The fiscal periods of certain foreign
    operations end one month earlier than the Company's year end
    to facilitate their inclusion in the consolidated financial
    statements.

       FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:  In accordance with the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") Statement
    No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation," balance sheet
    accounts of the Company's foreign operations are translated
    from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at year end or
    historical rates while income and expenses are translated at
    the weighted average sales exchange rates for the year.
    Translation gains or losses related to net assets located
    outside the United States are shown as a separate component
    of stockholders' equity.  Losses aggregating $19,803,000, net
    of tax, relating to discontinued operations were transferred
    from equity and charged to loss on disposal of discontinued
    operations during 1993.  Gains and losses resulting from
    foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a
    currency other than the entity's functional currency) are
    included in net income.  Such foreign currency transaction
    gains approximated $1,495,000 for the year ended December 31,
    1994, $762,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993,
    $3,065,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1992 and
    $10,642,000 for the year ended June 30, 1992.

        CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE-PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES:
    In January 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standard ("FAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income
    Taxes" ("FAS 109") and applied the provisions prospectively.
    The adoption of FAS 109 changes the Company's method of
    accounting for income taxes from the deferred method ("APB
    11") to an asset and liability approach.  Previously, the
    Company deferred the past tax effects of timing differences
    between financial reporting and taxable income.  The asset
    and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred
    tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
    amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.

       The adjustments to the January 1, 1993 balance sheet to
    adopt FAS 109 totaled $13,014,000.  Approximately $9,786,000
    of this adjustment related to continuing operations and the
    remaining $3,228,000 was from discontinued operations.  The
    aggregate amount of $13,014,000 is refleted in the
    accompanying 1993 Consolidated Statements of Income as the
    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.  It
    primarily represents the impact of adjusting deferred taxes
    to reflect the then current tax rate of 34% as opposed to the
    higher tax rates that were in effect when the deferred taxes
    originated.  See Note 12 for further discussion of income
    taxes.

       EXTENDED SERVICE CONTRACTS:  Tandy's retail operations
    offer extended service contracts on products sold.  These
    contracts generally provide extended service coverage for
    period of 12 to 48 months.  Contracts sold prior to January
    1, 1995 were offered directly by the Company, and thus the
    Company was the responsible party.  The Company accounts for
    such contracts in accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No.
    90-1, "Accounting for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and
    Product Maintenance Contracts" which requires that revenues
    from sales of extended service contracts be recognized
    ratably over the lives of the contracts.  Costs directly
    related to sales of such contracts are deferred and charged
    to expense proportionately as the revenues are recognized.  A
    loss is recognized on extended service contracts if the sum
    of the expected costs of providing services under the
    contracts exceeds related unearned revenue.

       As described in Note 3, the Company transferred all
    obligations with respect to contracts in force at December
    31, 1994 to an unrelated party, except certain contracts
    aggregating approximately $7,734,000.  The Company will sell
    extended service contracts offered by the unrelated third
    party subsequent to 1994.  The Company will receive a
    commission from the unrelated third party upon sale of each
    contract.  The commissions will be recognized as income in
    the period in which the contracts are sold.

       CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS:  Cash on hand in stores,
    deposits in banks and short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less are considered cash and
    cash equivalents.  Short-term investments are carried at
    cost, which approximates market value.

       ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS:
         CREDIT OPERATIONS-The customer receivables of the credit
    operations are classified as current assets, including
    amounts which are contractually due after one year.  This is
    consitent with retail industry practices.

       Finance charges, late charges and returned check fees
    arising from the Company's private label credit cards are
    recognized when earned as interest income.  The Company's
    policy is to write off accounts when they become 180 days
    past due or whenever deemed uncollectible by management,
    whichever is sooner.  Collection efforts continue subsequent
    to write-off.

       The Company is charged a fee by an outside accounts
    receivable processing service for establishing new accounts.
    These initial direct costs are capitalized and amortized on a
    straight-line basis over a period of 84 months, the estimated
    life over which the account will be used by a customer.
    These costs are shown in the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheets as a part of the related accounts receivable.
    Amortization of these loan origination costs are included as
    a reduction of interest income in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Income.  Costs to process accounts
    on an ongoing basis are expensed as incurred.

       As described in Note 3, the Company's Computer City and
    Incredible Universe private label credit card portfolios were
    sold in December 1994, and a letter of intent was signed to
    sell Tandy Credit and the Company's Radio Shack and McDuff
    private label credit card portfolios in the first half of
    1995, subject to regulatory and rating agency approval.
    Commencing in 1995, sales made pursuant to Computer City and
    Incredible Universe private label credit card programs, as
    well as sales made pursuant to the Radio Shack private label
    credit card program made subsequent to the finalization of
    its sales agreement, will be financed by an unrelated third
    party.

         OTHER CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES-An allowance for doubtful
    accounts is provided when accounts are determined to be
    uncollectible.

       Concentrations of credit risk with respect to customer
    receivables are limited due to the large number of customers
    comprising the Company's customer base and their location in
    many different geographic areas of the country; however, see
    Note 8 for a discussion of a concentration of credit risk of
    long-term receivables.  The fair value of total receivables,
    recorded at approximately $898,027,000 on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet at December 31, 1994, is approximately
    $912,000,000.

       INVENTORIES:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
    (principally based on average cost) or market value and are
    comprised primarily of finished goods.

       PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:  For financial reporting
    purposes, depreciation and amortization are primarily
    calculated using the straight-line method, which amortizes
    the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives. 
    The ranges of estimated useful lives are:
      
    _____________________________________________________________
    Buildings .......................                 10-40 years
    Buildings under capital lease ...  over the life of the lease
    Equipment .......................                  2-15 years
    Leasehold improvements ..........   primarily, the shorter of
                              the life of the improvements or the
            term of the related lease and certain renewal periods
    _____________________________________________________________


       When depreciable assets are sold or retired, the related
    cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts.  Any gains or losses are included in selling,
    general and administrative expenses.  Major additions and
    betterments are capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs which
    do not materially improve or extend the lives of the
    respective assets are charged to operating expenses as
    incurred.  Amortization of buildings under capital lease is
    included in depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

       AMORTIZATION OF EXCESS PURCHASE PRICE OVER NET TANGIBLE
         ASSETS OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED:  The excess purchase
    price is generally amortized over a 40-year period using the
    straight-line method and the net balance is classified as a
    non-current asset.  The Company periodically reviews goodwill
    to assess recoverability, and impairments would be recognized
    in operating results if a permanent diminution in value were
    to occur.

       FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  The fair value of
    financial instruments is determined by reference to various
    market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate.
    Unless otherwise disclosed, the fair values of financial
    instruments approximate their recorded values.

       HEDGING AND DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY:  The Company has not
    historically utilized derivatives to manage foreign currency
    risks and exposure except for an immaterial amount of foreign
    exchange forward contracts used to hedge a portion of its
    foreign purchases.  As of December 31, 1994, the Company had
    no outstanding purchase orders for which a foreign exchange
    contract was used as a hedge.  The few contracts that were
    used did not involve leverage and did not have other high
    risk characteristics.  Moody's has assigned a counterparty
    rating to Tandy Corporation of Baa2.  This rating is an
    opinion of the financial capacity of Tandy to honor its
    senior obligations under financial contracts.  Financial
    contracts entered into by Tandy include the limited use of
    foreign currency forwards to hedge foreign exchange risk
    arising from the purchase of inventory.

       In conjunction with sale-leaseback transactions of
    Incredible Universe properties, the Company from time to time
    may enter into interest rate swaps to lock in a fixed rate
    that Company management believes is beneficial in the
    long-term.  Through March 10, 1995, the Company entered into
    five swaps whereby it traded floating rates for fixed rates
    ranging from 7.185% to 7.875%.  These swaps related to
    notional amounts of approximately $90,000,000; the Board of
    Directors has authorized management to enter into such swaps
    up to notional amounts not exceeding $250,000,000.  During
    1994, 1993, the six months ended December 31, 1992 and the
    year ended June 30, 1992, the Company was not a party to any
    interest rate swaps.

       REVENUES:  Retail sales are recorded on the accrual basis.
    Credit service charges are recorded monthly on the basis of
    customer account balances.

       STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS:  Direct incremental expenses
    associated with the openings of new Computer City and
    Incredible Universe stores, comprised primarily of payroll
    and payroll-related costs, are deferred and amortized over a
    twelve-month period from the date of the store opening.
    Deferred store pre-opening expenses for Computer City and
    Incredible Universe approximated $4,538,000 and $1,845,000 at
    December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

       NET INCOME PER AVERAGE COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARE:
    Net income per average common and common equivalent share is
    computed by dividing net income less the Series B convertible
    stock dividends by the weighted average common and common
    equivalent shares outstanding during the period.  As the
    Preferred Equity Redemption Convertible Preferred Stock
    ("PERCS") mandatorily convert into common stock, they are
    considered outstanding common stock and the dividends are not
    deducted from net income for purposes of calculating net
    income per average common and common equivalent share.  On
    January 23, 1995, the Company announced that the PERCS would
    be converted on March 10, 1995.  To complete the conversion,
    the Company will issue approximately 11,816,000 shares of
    Tandy Corporation common stock out of treasury stock. 
    Current year weighted average share calculations include
    approximately 11,816,000 common shares relating to the PERCS.
    Per share amounts and the weighted average number of shares
    outstanding for the year ended December 31, 1993, the
    six-month period ended December 31, 1992 and for the fiscal
    year ended June 30, 1992, have been retroactively restated to
    reflect the PERCS conversion into approximately 11,816,000
    common shares in lieu of the prior year assumption of
    12,457,000 shares which was based on the December 31, 1993
    common stock price.

       Earnings available per common and common equivalent share
    amounts initially reported by the Company for the year ended
    December 31, 1993, the six months ended December 31, 1992 and
    the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 were $2.48, $0.84 and
    $2.58 for income from continuing operations, respectively,
    and $1.18, $0.02 and $2.24 for net income, respectively.
    Fully diluted earnings available per common and common
    equivalent share are not presented since dilution is less
    than 3%.

       The Series B convertible stock dividends were $6,777,000
    for the year ended December 31, 1994, $7,136,000 for the year
    ended December 31, 1993, $2,419,000, net of tax, for the six
    months ended December 31, 1992 and $4,911,000, net of tax, in
    fiscal 1992.  The taxes netted against these amounts for the
    six months ended December 31, 1992 and in fiscal 1992 were
    $1,246,000 and $2,530,000, respectively.  Upon adoption of
    FAS 109 as of January 1, 1993 and in accordance with EITF
    92-3, preferred dividends utilized in the earnings per share
    calculation can no longer be reduced for associated tax
    benefits paid on unallocated preferred stock held by an
    employee stock ownership plan.  Dividends on the PERCS, which
    were issued in February 1992, were $32,100,000 for each of
    the two years ended December 31, 1994, $16,050,000 for the
    six months ended December 31, 1992 and $12,573,000 for the
    year ended June 30, 1992.

       Earnings available per common and common equivalent share
    for each period presented, assuming the PERCS converted to
    common stock under the "if converted" method and only if
    dilutive, would have been presented as in the table which
    follows.

    </TABLE>

       TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM:  On August 1, 1994, the
    Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized
    management to purchase up to 7,500,000 shares of its common
    stock in addition to shares required for employee plans.  On
    December 30, 1994, the Board of Directors authorized
    management to increase the share repurchase program to
    12,500,000 shares.  Purchases will be made from time to time
    in the open market, and it is expected that funding of the
    program will come from existing cash, short-term debt and
    proceeds from the sale of the credit card portfolios.  At
    December 31, 1994, approximately 5,000,000 shares had been
    repurchased under this program.

       NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:  The American Institute of
    Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position
    93-7, "Reporting on Advertising Costs," in December 1993. 
    The statement generally requires all advertising costs to be
    expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred or the
    first time the advertising takes place, and is effective for
    years beginning after June 15, 1994.  The statement is not
    anticipated to have any material effect on the results of
    operations or financial condition of the Company.

    NOTE 3-GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS AND EXTENDED SERVICE
       CONTRACTS
       In December 1994 the Company entered into an agreement
    with SPS Transaction Services, Inc., a majority-owned
    subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Company ("SPS") to sell
    its Computer City and Incredible Universe private label
    credit card portfolios without recourse.  As a result of the
    agreement, in which Tandy received cash of $85,764,000 and
    will receive a deferred payment of $179,777,000, the Company
    recognized a gain of $35,708,000 in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Income.  The deferred payment
    amount does not bear interest.  Principal will be paid
    monthly with the total principal amount of $179,777,000 due
    over a twelve month period.  The Company has discounted the
    deferred payment by $3,477,000 to yield approximately 5% over
    the twelve month payout period.  As a result, the discounted
    deferred payment amount of $176,300,000 is classified as
    current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at
    December 31, 1994.  The Company also signed a letter of
    intent to sell its Radio Shack and McDuff private label
    credit card portfolios at net book value and without recourse
    to SPS in 1995 including the rights to the securitized
    accounts (see Note 6).  The agreement for the sale of McDuff
    and Radio Shack portfolios was completed in January 1995,
    subject only to regulatory and rating agency approvals which
    should be forthcoming in the first half of 1995.  Tandy
    anticipates receiving approximately $290,000,000 (unaudited)
    cash and a deferred payment approximating $80,000,000
    (unaudited), on terms similar to the deferred payment
    arrangement mentioned above.

       Effective December 1994, the Company transferred all of
    its existing obligations with respect to extended service
    contracts in force at December 31, 1994, with the exception
    of certain contracts aggregating approximately $7,734,000, to
    an unrelated third party.  The unrelated third party
    contractually assumed all of the Company's legal obligations
    and risk of future loss pursuant to the extended service
    contracts in exchange for $75,059,000, of which $70,702,000
    was paid in December 1994 and $4,357,000 was paid in February
    1995.  As a result, the Company has recognized a gain of
    $55,729,000 associated with this transaction in its
    accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  The Company
    will continue to provide repair services to customers who
    tender products pursuant to the extended service contracts on
    a non-exclusive basis.  The unrelated third party will pay
    the Company competitive market rates for repairs on products
    tendered pursuant to the extended service contracts.

       The Company will continue to sell extended service
    contracts on behalf of the unrelated third party and will
    receive a commission upon the sale.  The commission will be
    recognized as commission income at the time of sale.

    NOTE 4-RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
       In December 1994, the Company adopted a business
    restructuring plan to close or convert 233 of the 306 Tandy
    Name Brand stores.  Closed stores will include 151
    VideoConcepts, 30 McDuff mall stores and 19 McDuff
    Supercenters.  Thirty-three other mall stores or McDuff
    Supercenters will be converted to Radio Shack or Computer
    City Express stores.  It is anticipated that a majority of
    these stores will be closed by the end of the first quarter
    of 1995.  Approximately 57 McDuff Supercenters and 16 The
    Edge in Electronics stores will remain open and will become
    part of the Specialty Retail Group of Radio Shack.  A pre-tax
    charge of $89,071,000 was taken in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 1994 related to the closing and conversion of these
    stores.  The components of the restructuring charge and an
    analysis of the amounts charged against the reserve are
    outlined in the following table:

    (In thousands)
    --------------
    Lease obligations                       $46,682
    Impairment of fixed assets               17,991
    Inventory impairment                     16,600
    Goodwill impairment                       4,222
    Termination benefits                      1,218
    Other                                     2,358
                                            -------
    Total restructuring reserve charge       89,071

    Costs charged against the reserve:
      Goodwill                               (4,222)
      Lease payments                         (1,466)
                                            -------
    Ending reserve                          $83,383
                                            =======

       The lease obligations, termination benefits and conversion
    of 33 stores will require cash outlays, most of which are
    expected to be made during 1995.  The cash outlays will be
    financed by operating cash flows.  Management anticipates
    that pre-tax operating losses during the period of store
    closures will approximate $6,000,000 to $8,000,000
    (unaudited).

       Sales and operating revenues associated with the closing
    of Tandy Name Brand stores were approximately $261,990,000
    (unaudited) and $271,914,000 (unaudited) for calendar years
    1994 and 1993, respectively, and operating losses
    approximated $18,125,000 (unaudited) and $15,342,000
    (unaudited) for calendar 1994 and 1993, respectively.  During
    the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, sales and operating
    revenues and operating losses from the closing stores were
    approximately $254,531,000 (unaudited) and $10,169,000
    (unaudited), respectively.  The results of the closing stores
    for the six months ended December 31, 1992 are not presented
    because, due to the seasonal nature of the stores'
    operations, such results would not be comparable to any of
    the twelve-month results for the other periods presented.  In
    conjunction with this restructuring, 1,425 (unaudited)
    employees will be terminated, most of which are store
    employees and managers.  As of December 31, 1994, no
    employees had been terminated and, accordingly, no
    termination benefits had been paid.

       The Company adopted a plan resulting in business
    restructuring charges during the six months ended December
    31, 1992 designed to improve the Company's competitiveness
    and future profitability.  The pre-tax charge of $48,000,000
    related primarily to the closing of 110 of the then 432 Tandy
    Name Brand stores, mainly McDuff Supercenters in major market
    areas and, to a lesser extent, the elimination of certain
    product lines.  Some product lines were reduced or eliminated
    after consideration of competitive factors and market trends.
    These stores were closed in the first quarter of 1993.
    Additional restructuring charges of $39,500,000, related to
    discontinued operations, were recognized in the six months
    ending December 31, 1992 and primarily related to the
    write-off of goodwill, the rationalization of certain product
    lines and the closure of certain operations.  This
    restructuring charge is included in the operating loss from
    discontinued operations.

    NOTE 5-SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
       The weighted average interest rate was 5.2% at December
    31, 1994 for short-term investments totaling $80,373,000. 
    The weighted average interest rate was 3.2% at December 31,
    1993 for short-term investments totaling $153,839,000.

       Effective May 1, 1991, the Company transferred
    $573,500,000 of its customer receivables to a trust which, in
    turn, on June 18, 1991, sold $350,000,000 of certificates
    representing undivided interests in the trust in a public
    offering.  At December 31, 1994 and 1993, $300,990,000 and
    $350,000,000, respectively, of the certificates were
    outstanding and, accordingly, were not reflected in the
    Company's accounts receivable balances.  The fair value of
    the certificates at December 31, 1994 was approximately
    $301,652,000.  At December 31, 1994, the balance of the
    receivables in the trust approximated $534,129,000.  The
    Company owns the remaining undivided interest in the trust
    not represented by the certificates and will continue to
    service the receivables for the trust until the sale of Tandy
    Credit to SPS is completed.  The Company has no plans to
    issue additional series of certificates as the Trust is
    included in the sale of Tandy's remaining private label
    credit card portfolio balances to SPS in 1995.  For further
    discussion of the sale of the private label credit card
    portfolios, see Note 3.

       Cash flows generated from the receivables in the trust are
    dedicated to the payment of interest on the certificates
    which have an annual fixed interest rate of 8.25%, absorption
    of defaulted accounts in the trust and payment of servicing
    fees to the Company with any remaining cash flows remitted to
    the Company.  In the event that such excess cash flows are
    not sufficient to absorb defaulted accounts, the Company is
    contingently liable up to a maximum amount of $136,100,000.
 
       Customer receivable balances of credit operations are
    classified as current assets in accordance with industry
    practice. The Company's private label credit card accounts
    involve revolving rather than installment payments and many
    customers pay off their balances sooner than the contractual
    term.  The repayment terms of the Company's private label
    credit cards are as follows: Radio Shack and McDuff customers
    must pay each month a minimum of 1/33 of any balance greater
    than $1,000, and Incredible Universe and Computer City
    customers must pay each month a minimum of 1/25 of any
    balance greater than $1,000.  For any balances less than
    $1,000, the minimum monthly payment ranges between $15 and
    $35 for each customer account.

       Interest income related to the Company's credit card
    operations totaled $46,868,000 for the year ended December
    31, 1994, $57,401,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993,
    $31,308,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1992 and
    $62,307,000 for the year ended June 30, 1992.  In 1994 the
    Company received interest income from the IRS reflecting the
    settlement of outstanding tax issues of approximately
    $9,582,000, as well as interest income earned on notes
    receivable from AST Research Inc. ("AST") and InterTAN Inc.
    ("InterTAN") approximating $5,724,000 and $8,280,000,
    respectively.

    NOTE 8-OTHER ASSETS
       Other assets include the excess purchase price over net
    tangible assets of businesses acquired of $13,747,000 at
    December 31, 1994 and $18,207,000 at December 31, 1993. 
    These amounts are net of accumulated amortization of
    $5,035,000, and $4,485,000, respectively.  The balance of
    other assets at December 31, 1994 also includes long-term
    receivables relating to InterTAN , AST and Lika of
    $128,926,000, net of discount of $16,796,000.  The balance at
    December 31, 1993 includes long-term receivables relating to
    InterTAN and AST of $126,384,000, net of discount of
    $22,198,000.  See Notes 21 and 22 for a further description
    of the terms of the AST and InterTAN notes receivable.

    NOTE 9-INDEBTEDNESS AND BORROWING FACILITIES
       Borrowings payable within one year are summarized in the
    accompanying short-term debt table on page 42.  The
    short-term debt caption includes primarily domestic seasonal
    borrowings.  The current portion of long-term debt at
    December 31, 1994 includes $45,000,000 of senior notes and
    $6,208,000 of medium-term notes and other loans.  The current
    portion of long-term debt at December 31, 1993 includes
    $52,497,000 of medium-term notes and $30,204,000 of bank debt
    and other loans.  The short-term debt at December 31, 1993
    also included $31,739,000 of 10% subordinated debentures due
    June 30, 1994.  These subordinated debentures were called by
    the Company on February 23, 1994 for redemption on April 1,
    1994.  The redemption was at a price equal to 100% of face
    value of the subordinated debentures for a total of
    $32,431,000.

       Tandy's short-term credit facilities, including revolving
    credit lines, are summarized in the accompanying short-term
    borrowing facilities table found on page 43.  The method used
    to compute averages in the short-term borrowing facilities
    table is based on a daily weighted average computation which
    takes into consideration the time period such debt was
    outstanding as well as the amount outstanding.  The Company's
    primary source of short-term debt, for which borrowings and
    repayments have been presented net in the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows, consists of short-term seasonal
    bank debt and commercial paper.  The commercial paper matures
    within ninety days as does the short-term seasonal bank debt.

       A commercial paper program was established during fiscal
    1991 for Tandy and was renewed in May 1994.  The Company has
    $400,000,000 in committed facilities in place for the
    commercial paper program.  These facilities are to be used
    only if maturing commercial paper cannot be repaid due to an
    inability to sell new paper.  This agreement is composed of
    two facilities--one for $200,000,000 expiring in May 1995 and
    another facility for $200,000,000 expiring in May 1997.
    Annual commitment fees for the facilities are 2/25 of 1% per
    annum and 1/8 of 1% per annum, respectively, whether used or
    unused.  The commercial paper facilities limit the amount of
    commercial paper that may be outstanding to a maximum of
    $400,000,000.  At December 31, 1994, there were no amounts
    outstanding under the facilities.

       Long-term debt, net of current maturities, at December 31,
    1994 and December 31, 1993 totaled $153,318,000 and
    $186,638,000, respectively.  Included in long-term debt at
    December 31, 1993 is $45,000,000 of 8.69% senior notes due
    January 15, 1995.  These senior notes had been outstanding
    since February 7, 1990.

       Tandy completed a $500,000,000 shelf registration in
    January 1991 of which $400,000,000 was designated for
    medium-term notes.  Tandy Credit's $400,000,000 shelf
    registration was amended in October 1990 to add a
    $200,000,000 Series B medium-term note program.  At December
    31, 1994 available borrowing capacity under Tandy's and Tandy
    Credit's medium-term note programs aggregated $429,200,000. 
    Medium-term notes outstanding at December 31, 1994 totaled
    $73,044,000 compared to $125,479,000 at December 31, 1993.
    The weighted average coupon rates of medium-term notes
    outstanding at December 31, 1994 and 1993 were 8.5% and 8.7%,
    respectively.  The $6,000,000 of Tandy Credit's medium-term
    notes maturing in May and August of 1995 were paid in full in
    February 1995.  Tandy Corporation's medium-term notes mature
    as follows:

       The Company established an employee stock ownership trust
    in June 1990.  Further information on the trust and its
    related indebtedness, which is guaranteed by the Company, is
    detailed in the discussion of the Tandy Employees Stock
    Ownership Plan in Note 14.

    1994.

    NOTE 10-LEASES
       Tandy leases rather than owns most of its facilities.  The
    Radio Shack stores comprise the largest portion of Tandy's
    leased facilities.  The Radio Shack, Tandy Name Brand and
    Computer City stores are located primarily in major shopping
    malls, shopping centers or freestanding facilities owned by
    other companies.  The Company owns three of the nine
    Incredible Universe buildings.  The store leases are
    generally based on a minimum rental plus a percentage of the
    store's sales in excess of a stipulated base figure.  Tandy
    also leases distribution centers and office space.  In 1994,
    under a sale and leaseback agreement with an unrelated third
    party, the Company sold certain Incredible Universe stores
    for approximately $52,719,000 and leased the properties back
    under a lease agreement which matures on September 9, 1999.
    The transaction produced a gain of approximately $1,664,000
    which was deferred and is being amortized over the life of
    the lease periods.  The Company does not have any continuing
    involvement under the sale-leaseback transaction.  The future
    minimum lease payments are included in the table below.

       Future minimum rent commitments at December 31, 1994 for
    all long-term noncancelable leases (net of immaterial amounts
    of sublease rent income) are included in the following table.

       The IRS Dallas field office is reviewing the Company's
    1987-1989 tax returns.  The review in Dallas could lead to
    referral to the IRS National office.  The resolution of this
    matter could result in additional taxes and interest to the
    Company related to the spin-off of InterTAN and raises
    questions about the private letter rulings issued by the IRS
    regarding the spin-off and certain other tax matters. 
    Although aggregate additional taxes involved in these
    transactions could potentially range from $0 to $46 million,
    based on the advice of the Company's independent tax
    advisors, the Company believes it would prevail if any tax
    litigation had to be instituted.  Any ultimate tax assessment
    would also include interest.  In any event the Company
    believes the ultimate resolution would have no material
    impact on the Company's financial condition.

       In January 1993, the Company adopted FAS No. 109.  The
    adoption of FAS 109 changes the Company's method of
    accounting for income taxes from the deferred method ("APB
    11") to an asset and liability approach.  Previously, the
    Company deferred the past tax effects of timing differences
    between financial reporting and taxable income.  The asset
    and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred
    tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
    amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.

       The adjustments to the January 1, 1993 balance sheet to
    adopt FAS 109 totaled $13,014,000.  Approximately $9,786,000
    of this adjustment related to continuing operations and the
    remaining $3,228,000 was from discontinued operations.  The
    aggregate amount of $13,014,000 was reflected in 1993 net
    income as the cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle.  It primarily represents the impact of adjusting
    deferred taxes to reflect the then current tax rate of 34% as
    opposed to the higher tax rates that were in effect when the
    deferred taxes originated.  The Company subsequently
    increased its U.S. deferred tax asset in 1993 as a result of
    legislation enacted during 1993 which increased the corporate
    tax rate from 34% to 35%.  Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities as of December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993
    were comprised of the following:

    NOTE 13-STOCK PURCHASE AND SAVINGS PLANS
       Stock purchase and savings plans are offered by Tandy
    Corporation to its employees.  These plans are designed to
    provide employees with a consistent investment program which
    provides for their retirement and an opportunity to
    participate in the Company's growth.

    TANDY CORPORATION STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM ("SPP").  The SPP is
    available to most employees who have been employed at least
    six months.  Participants may contribute 1% to 10% of annual
    compensation.  The Company matches 40%, 60% or 80% of the
    employee's contribution depending on the length of the
    employee's participation in the SPP.  Tandy's contributions
    to the SPP were $16,881,000 and $18,955,000 for the calendar
    years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and
    $8,756,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1992.  For
    fiscal 1992 the Company's contributions were $20,253,000.

    TANDY EMPLOYEES DEFERRED SALARY AND INVESTMENT PLAN ("DIP").
    An eligible employee electing to participate in the DIP may
    defer 5% of annual compensation, subject to certain
    limitations established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  The
    Company pays this amount into the plan as a deferred salary
    contribution for the account of the employee.  The employee's
    5% contribution is considered deferred compensation and is
    not taxed to the employee as long as it remains in the plan.
    Beginning October 1990, the Company began making
    contributions to the newly formed employee stock ownership
    plan described in Note 14 in lieu of the matching
    contributions to the DIP.  To participate in the employee
    stock ownership plan, employees must continue to make
    deferred salary contributions to the DIP.  In June 1992, the
    Company received a determination letter ruling that the DIP
    is a qualified 401(k) plan.  An administrative committee
    appointed by the Board of Directors invests the DIP's assets
    primarily in Tandy securities.

    NOTE 14-TANDY EMPLOYEES STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN ("TESOP")
       As a continuation of the Company's programs to encourage
    employee ownership of Tandy stock, the Company formed the
    TESOP on June 28, 1990.  On July 31, 1990, the TESOP trustee
    borrowed $100,000,000 at an interest rate of 9.34% with
    varying semi-annual principal payments through June 30, 2000.
    On December 15, 1994, the TESOP entered into an agreement
    with an unrelated third party to refinance a portion of the
    TESOP's indebtedness by borrowing $5,063,000 at an interest
    rate of 8.76% to retire a portion of the original
    $100,000,000 indebtedness.  The maturity date of this
    borrowing is December 30, 2000.  The TESOP plans to borrow an
    additional $11,630,000 over the next five years.  The final
    maturity on the additional borrowings is projected to be
    December 30, 2002.  Dividend payments and contributions from
    Tandy will be used to repay the indebtedness.  Because Tandy
    has guaranteed the repayment of these notes, the indebtedness
    of the TESOP is recognized as a long-term obligation in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  An offsetting
    charge has been made in the stockholders' equity section of
    the accompanying consolidated balance sheet to reflect
    unearned compensation related to the TESOP.

       The TESOP trustee used the proceeds from the issuance of
    the 1990 notes to purchase 100,000 shares of Series B TESOP
    Convertible Preferred Stock (the "TESOP Preferred Stock")
    from Tandy at a price of $1,000 per share.  Each share of
    such stock is convertible into 21.768 shares of Tandy common
    stock.  The annual cumulative dividend on TESOP Preferred
    Stock is $75.00 per share, payable semi-annually.  This
    series of stock has certain liquidation preferences and may
    be redeemed by Tandy after July 1, 1994 at specified
    premiums.

       During the term of the TESOP, the TESOP Preferred Stock
    will be allocated to the participants annually based on the
    total debt service made on the indebtedness.  In 1994 the
    TESOP was amended to provide for quarterly withdrawals by
    participants and an annual allocation of TESOP Preferred
    Stock to participants.  The first annual allocation will
    occur on March 31, 1995.  The allocations of preferred stock
    to the individual participants' accounts are determined
    according to the terms of the TESOP.  As vested participants
    withdraw from the TESOP, payments are made in cash or Tandy
    common stock.  The preferred stock has a face value of $1,000
    per share and the Company is obligated to redeem the
    preferred stock at the higher of the appraised value or
    $1,000 per share in the event of a participant's withdrawal.
    The Company has the option to redeem the preferred stock in
    either cash or common stock.  Forfeited shares are returned
    to the TESOP and allocated to the accounts of other
    participants.  In June 1992 the Company received a
    determination letter ruling from the IRS that the TESOP was a
    qualified employee stock ownership plan.

       In fiscal 1991 Tandy recorded, as a component of
    stockholders' equity, $100,000,000 of unearned compensation
    to reflect the value of the TESOP Preferred Stock sold to the
    TESOP.  As shares of the TESOP Preferred Stock are allocated
    to the TESOP participants, compensation expense is recorded
    and unearned compensation is reduced.  Interest expense on
    the TESOP notes is also recognized as a cost of the TESOP.
    The compensation component of the TESOP expense is reduced by
    the amount of dividends accrued on the TESOP Preferred Stock
    with any dividends in excess of the compensation expense
    reflected as a reduction of interest expense.  During the
    year ended December 31, 1994, the compensation and interest
    costs related to the TESOP before the reduction for the
    allocation of dividends were $10,008,000 and $6,202,000,
    respectively.  The compensation and interest costs related to
    the TESOP before the reduction for the allocation of
    dividends were $9,605,000 and $7,195,000, respectively,
    during the year ended December 31, 1993.  During the six
    months ended December 31, 1992, the compensation and interest
    costs related to the TESOP before the reduction for the
    allocation of dividends were $4,266,000 and $3,969,000,
    respectively.  Such amounts for fiscal 1992 were $8,233,000
    and $8,526,000, respectively.  Contributions from Tandy to
    the TESOP for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993
    totaled $11,189,000 and $17,895,000, respectively, including
    the $6,777,000 and $7,135,000 of dividends paid on the TESOP
    Preferred Stock.  Contributions for the six months ended
    December 31, 1992 and the year ended June 30, 1992 totaled
    $9,269,000 and $16,926,000, respectively, including the
    $3,665,000 and $7,441,000 of dividends paid on the TESOP
    Preferred Stock.

       At September 30, 1994, 31,020 shares of TESOP Preferred
    Stock had been released and allocated to participants'
    accounts in the TESOP (including 10,288 shares which had been
    withdrawn by participants).  At December 31, 1994, 8,142
    shares of TESOP Preferred Stock were released for allocation
    to participants at March 31, 1995.  At December 31, 1994,
    60,838 shares of TESOP Preferred Stock were available for
    later release and allocation to participants over the
    remaining life of the TESOP.

       Under the terms of Tandy's guarantee of the notes, Tandy
    is obligated to make semiannual contributions to the TESOP to
    enable it to pay principal and interest on the debt
    securities.  Tandy has fully and unconditionally guaranteed
    the TESOP's payment obligations, whether at maturity, upon
    redemption, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise.
    The holders of the notes have no recourse against the assets
    of the TESOP except in the event that the TESOP defaults on
    payments due and then only to the extent that the TESOP holds
    cash payments made by Tandy to the TESOP to enable it to meet
    its obligations under the notes and any earnings attributable
    to such contributions.  No amounts were in default as of
    December 31, 1994.  The TESOP fiscal year ends on March 31.
    At March 31, 1994, the TESOP held as assets $95,786,000 of
    TESOP Preferred Stock and $4,186,000 of receivables and had
    liabilities comprised of the remaining principal on the notes
    of $68,980,000 and accrued interest payable on the notes of
    $1,611,000, resulting in net assets of $29,381,000.

    NOTE 15-STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS
      1985 Stock Option Plan ("SOP")
      ------------------------------
       Under the 1985 SOP, as amended, options to acquire up to
    2,000,000 fully registered shares of Tandy's common stock may
    be granted to officers and key management employees of the
    Company.  The Organization and Compensation Committee (the
    "Committee") has sole discretion in determining whether to
    grant options, who shall receive them, the number of options
    granted to any individual and whether an option will be an
    incentive stock option or a nonstatutory stock option.  The
    term of incentive stock options may not exceed 10 years and
    the term of nonstatutory stock options may not exceed a term
    of 10 years plus one month.  No option may be exercised
    within one year of the date of grant and then may be
    exercised in specified installments only after stated
    intervals of time.

       The maximum amount that may be exercised at the expiration
    of each of the first through fifth anniversaries of the
    nonstatutory stock options is 20%.  On each of the first
    three anniversaries of the date of grant of the incentive
    stock options, one-third of each individual's options become
    exercisable.  Upon termination of employment, the optionee
    must exercise all currently vested options by the earlier of
    the option expiration date(s) or three months from the date
    of termination of employment or forfeit such options, except
    that upon retirement at age 55 or older the three months is
    extended to 12 months in the case of nonstatutory stock
    options only.  Notwithstanding the grant of options initially
    exercisable in installments, upon the termination of
    employment as a result of death or total disability of an
    optionee, all options then held shall for a period of 12
    months, subject to earlier termination at the fixed
    expiration date, become immediately exercisable without
    regard to dates at which the installments are exercisable.
    Upon the retirement of an optionee at age 55 or older, the
    Committee may in its discretion accelerate the dates at which
    remaining installments of options may be exercised to the
    date of retirement.  In the event of a change in control, all
    outstanding options become immediately exercisable for the
    full number of shares subject to options.  The option price
    is determined by the Committee at the time the option is
    granted, but the option price will not be less than 100% of
    the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant.
    Since the option prices have been fixed at the market price
    on the date of grant, no compensation has been charged
    against earnings by the Company.  Authorized and unissued
    shares or treasury stock may be issued to participants when
    options are exercised.

       The SOP provides for adjustments to be made to options
    outstanding under the plan in order to prevent dilution of
    options upon the occurrence of a number of events, including
    the distribution of shares of a subsidiary of the Company to
    its stockholders.

       Under the SOP there were 1,290,974 vested options which
    could have been exercised for a total price of $44,460,052 at
    December 31, 1994.  Shares available for additional grants
    under the SOP were 242,626 at December 31, 1994.

      1993 Incentive Stock Plan ("ISP")
      ---------------------------------
       During March 1993, the Board adopted the ISP, as amended.
    The ISP is administered by the Committee.  A total of
    3,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock were reserved
    for issuance under the ISP and have been registered with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission.

       The ISP permits the grant of incentive stock options
    ("ISOs"), nonstatutory stock options (options which are not
    ISOs) ("NSOs"), stock appreciation rights ("SARs"),
    restricted stock, performance units or performance shares.

       Grants of options under the ISP shall be for terms
    specified by the Committee, except that the term shall not
    exceed 10 years (5 years if granted to a 10% or more
    stockholder of the Company's common stock).  Subject to the
    discretion of the Committee, options become exercisable in
    such installments and at such times as specified in the
    option agreements, payments for shares issuable upon exercise
    of an option may be made in cash, common stock, or a
    combination of both.  The amount payable upon exercise of a
    SAR may be made at the discretion of the Committee either in
    cash or common stock or in a combination of cash and common
    stock.  Provisions of the ISP generally provide that in the
    event of a change in control all options become immediately
    and fully exercisable and all restrictions on restricted
    stock lapse.

       As part of the ISP, each non-employee director of the
    Company receives a grant of NSOs for 3,000 shares of the
    Company's common stock on the first business day of September
    of each year ("Director Options").  Director Options have an
    exercise price of 100% of the fair market value of the
    Company's common stock on the trading day prior to the date
    of grant, vest as to one-third of the shares annually on the
    first three anniversary dates of the date of grant and expire
    10 years after the date of grant.  The first grant of the
    Director Options was made on September 1, 1993.

       The exercise price of an option (other than a Director
    Option) is determined by the Committee, provided that the
    exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market
    value of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of
    grant.

       At December 31, 1994 there were 122,290 vested options
    which could have been exercised for a total exercise price of
    $4,584,645 and 2,258,200 shares available for additional
    grants under the ISP.  The ISP shall terminate on the tenth
    anniversary of the day preceding the date of its adoption by
    the Board and no option or award shall be granted under the
    ISP thereafter.

       Stock option activity from June 30, 1991 through December
    31, 1994, including GRiD options, is summarized in the
    accompanying chart.

    NOTE 16-PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
       In August 1986 the Board of Directors adopted a
    stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one right
    for each outstanding share of Tandy common stock.  The Board
    amended the rights plan in June 1988 and amended and restated
    the rights plan in June 1990.  The rights, which will expire
    on June 22, 2000, are currently represented by the common
    stock certificates and when they become exercisable will
    entitle holders to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of
    Tandy Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for an
    exercise price of $140 (subject to adjustment).  The rights
    will become exercisable and will trade separately from the
    common stock only upon the date of public announcement that a
    person, entity or group ("Person") has acquired 15% or more
    of Tandy's outstanding common stock without the prior consent
    or approval of the disinterested directors ("Acquiring
    Person") or ten days after the commencement or public
    announcement of a tender or exchange offer which would result
    in any person becoming an Acquiring Person.  In the event
    that any person becomes an Acquiring Person, the rights will
    be exercisable for 60 days thereafter for Tandy common stock
    with a prior market value (as determined under the rights
    plan) equal to twice the exercise price.  In the event that,
    after any person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Company
    engages in certain mergers, consolidations, or sales of
    assets representing 50% or more of its assets or earning
    power with an Acquiring Person (or persons acting on behalf
    of or in concert with an Acquiring Person) or in which all
    holders of common stock are not treated alike, the rights
    will be exercisable for common stock of the acquiring or
    surviving company with a prior market value (as determined
    under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise price. 
    The rights will not be exercisable by any Acquiring Person.
    The rights are redeemable at a price of $.05 per right prior
    to any person becoming an Acquiring Person or, under certain
    circumstances, after the expiration of the 60-day period
    described above, but the rights may not be redeemed or the
    rights plan amended for 180 days following a change in a
    majority of the members of the Board (or if certain
    agreements are entered into during such 180-day period).

    NOTE 17-TERMINATION PROTECTION PLANS
       In August 1990, the Board of Directors of the Company
    approved termination protection plans and amendments to
    various other benefit plans including the stock purchase
    program and deferred salary and investment plan described in
    Note 13.  These plans provide for defined termination
    benefits to be paid to eligible employees of the Company who
    have been terminated, without cause, following a change in
    control of the Company (as defined).  In addition, for a
    certain period of time following employee termination, the
    Company, at its expense, must continue to provide on behalf
    of the terminated employee certain employment benefits.  In
    general, during the twelve months following a change in
    control, the Company may not terminate or change existing
    employee benefit plans in any way which will affect accrued
    benefits or decrease the rate of the Company's contribution
    to the plans.

    NOTE 18-ISSUANCE OF SERIES C PERCS AND TENDER OFFER
       In February 1992, the Company issued 15,000,000 depositary
    shares of Series C Conversion Preferred Stock ("Series C
    PERCS") at $29.50 per depositary share (equivalent to
    $2,950.00 for each Series C PERCS).  Each of the depositary
    shares represents ownership of 1/100th of a share of Series C
    PERCS.  The annual dividend for each depositary share is
    $2.14 (based on the annual dividend rate for each Series C
    PERCS of $214.00).  On April 15, 1995, each of the depositary
    shares will automatically convert into (i) one share of Tandy
    common stock (equivalent to 100 shares for each Series C
    PERCS) subject to adjustment in certain events and (ii) the
    right to receive on such date an amount in cash equal to all
    accrued and unpaid dividends thereon.  The liquidation
    preference for each depositary share is $29.50 (equivalent to
    $2,950.00 for each Series C PERCS) plus any accrued and
    unpaid dividends.

       Tandy announced on January 23, 1995 that it had exercised
    its right to call all the issued and outstanding PERCS for
    conversion on March 10, 1995, prior to its mandatory
    conversion date of April 15, 1995.  For each PERCS depositary
    share redeemed, 0.787757 Tandy common shares will be issued
    for an aggregate of approximately 11,816,000 shares.  In
    addition, each PERCS depositary share will receive a dividend
    in cash of $0.321 representing the accrued dividend from
    January 16, 1995 through the redemption date of March 10,
    1995.

       A capital lease obligation of $23,873,000 was recorded
    during the year for the lease of certain retail stores.

    NOTE 20-LITIGATION
        The Company is a defendant in a consolidated action
    titled "O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc. Securities
    Litigation", which was commenced in 1994 and is currently
    pending before the United States District Court for the
    Western District of Missouri.  The plaintiffs seek damages in
    an unspecified amount alleging that O'Sullivan's initial
    public offering prospectus, certain press releases and other
    materials contained material misrepresentations and
    omissions.  They have also named O'Sullivan, O'Sullivan's
    officers and directors, and the underwriters as defendants.
    Tandy believes that the lawsuit is totally without merit and
    is defending itself vigorously.  It further believes that
    even though an adverse resolution of the litigation may have
    a negative impact on its results of operation in the year of
    resolution, resolution will not have a material adverse
    effect on its financial condition or liquidity.

       Tandy has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third
    parties, investigations and pending actions involving
    allegations of negligence, product defects, discrimination,
    infringement of intellectual property rights, securities
    matters, tax deficiencies, violations of permits or licenses,
    and breach of contract and other matters against the Company
    and its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its
    business.  The liability, if any, associated with these
    matters was not determinable at December 31, 1994.  While
    certain of these matters involve substantial amounts, and
    although occasional adverse settlements or resolutions may
    occur and negatively impact earnings in the year of
    settlement, it is the opinion of management that their
    ultimate resolution will not have a materially adverse effect
    on Tandy's financial position.

    NOTE 21-DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
       On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy adopted
    a formal plan of divestiture under which the Company would
    sell its computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the
    O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ("O'Sullivan") ready-to-assemble
    furniture manufacturing and related marketing business, the
    Memtek Products division and the Lika printed circuit board
    business.

         Computer Manufacturing.  The Company closed the sale of
       the computer manufacturing and marketing businesses to AST
       Research, Inc. ("AST") on July 13, 1993.  In accordance
       with the terms of the definitive agreement between Tandy
       and AST, Tandy received $15,000,000 upon closing of the
       sale.  The balance of the purchase price of $90,000,000 is
       payable by a promissory note.  The principal amount of
       this promissory note is payable by July 12, 1996; interest
       is accrued and paid annually.  The interest rate on the
       promissory note is currently 4.94% per annum and is
       adjusted annually, not to exceed 5% per annum.  The terms
       of the promissory note stipulate that the outstanding
       principal balance may be paid at maturity at AST's option
       in cash or the common stock of AST.  However, at Tandy's
       option not more than 50% of the initial principal balance
       may be paid in common stock of AST.  The promissory note
       is supported by a standby letter of credit in the amount
       of the lesser of $100,000,000 or 70% of the outstanding
       principal amount of the promissory note.  At December 31,
       1994, the standby letter of credit approximated
       $67,704,000.

         In October 1993, the Company sold its computer marketing
        operations in France to AST, together with certain other
        multimedia assets and additional Swedish inventory, in
        return for an increase in the principal amount of the
        promissory note described above to $96,700,000.  The
        Company has discounted this note by $2,000,000 and the
        discount will be recognized as interest using the
        effective interest rate method over the life of the note.

         Memtek Products.  On November 10, 1993, the Company
       executed a definitive agreement with Hanny Magnetics
       (B.V.I.) Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation
       ("Hanny"), to purchase certain assets of the Company's
       Memtek Products operations, including the license
       agreement with Memorex Telex, N.V.  for the use of the
       Memorex trademark on licensed consumer electronics
       products.  This sale closed on December 16, 1993.  Hanny
       is a subsidiary of Hanny Magnetics (Holdings) Limited, a
       Bermuda corporation, listed on the Hong Kong Stock
       Exchange.  Proceeds from this sale aggregated
       $69,602,000.  The $7,102,000 receivable which remained at
       December 31, 1993 was paid in 1994.

         O'Sullivan Industries.  On January 27, 1994 the Company
       announced that it had reached an agreement with the
       underwriters to sell all the common stock of O'Sullivan
       Industries Holdings, Inc., the parent company of
       O'Sullivan, to the public at $22 per share.  The net
       proceeds realized by Tandy in the initial public offering,
       together with a $40,000,000 cash dividend from O'Sullivan
       Industries, Inc., approximated $350,000,000.  The initial
       public offering closed on February 2, 1994.

         Tandy has recognized income of approximately $4,399,000,
       net of tax, during the year ended December 31, 1994
       pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement
       Agreement between Tandy and O'Sullivan under which Tandy
       receives payments from O'Sullivan approximating the
       federal tax benefit that O'Sullivan realizes from the
       increased tax basis of its assets resulting from the
       initial public offering.  The higher tax basis increases
       O'Sullivan's tax deductions and, accordingly, reduces
       income taxes payable by O'Sullivan.  These payments will
       be made over a 15-year time period and are contingent upon
       O'Sullivan's taxable income each year.  The Company is
       recognizing these payments as additional sale proceeds and
       gain in the year in which the payments become due and
       payable to the Company pursuant to the Tax Sharing and Tax
       Benefit Reimbursement Agreement.  The additional gain is
       recorded as a reduction of SG&A expense in the
       accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

         Lika.  On October 11, 1994, Tandy sold the assets used
       in its Lika(R) printed circuit board division to Viktron
       Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership.  The
       proceeds from the sale and liquidation of assets
       approximated $16,380,000 which included $7,754,000 in
       cash, proceeds from liquidation of retained assets of
       $5,594,000 and secured promissory notes for $3,032,000.

       In connection with the computer manufacturing sale, the
    Memtek Products sale and the Lika sale, the Company agreed to
    retain certain liabilities primarily relating to warranty
    obligations on products sold prior to the sale.  Management
    believes that accrued reserves, as reflected on its December
    31, 1994 balance sheet, are adequate to cover estimated
    future warranty obligations for the products.

       The losses from discontinued operations prior to the
    measurement date are outlined in the table below.

    from the sale of Memtek Products, O'Sullivan and Lika, also
    inclusive of results of operations during the phase out
    period.

       Interest expense of $4,608,000 allocated through the
    measurement date of June 30, 1993 and $5,170,000 for the six
    months ended December 31, 1992, has been allocated to
    discontinued operations based on the percentage of the net
    assets of discontinued operations to total net assets.

    NOTE 22-RELATIONS WITH INTERTAN
       InterTAN, the former foreign retail operations of Tandy,
    was spun off to Tandy stockholders as a tax-free dividend in
    fiscal 1987.  Under the merchandise purchase terms of the
    original distribution agreement, InterTAN could purchase on
    payment terms products sold or secured by Tandy.  A&A
    International ("A&A"), a subsidiary of Tandy, was the
    exclusive purchasing agent for products originating in the
    Far East for InterTAN.

       On July 16, 1993 InterTAN had an account payable to Tandy
    of approximately $17,000,000 of which $7,600,000 was in
    default.  InterTAN's outstanding purchase orders for
    merchandise placed under the distribution agreement with
    Tandy, but not yet shipped, totaled approximately
    $44,000,000.  Because InterTAN had defaulted, on July 16
    Tandy terminated the merchandise purchase terms of the
    distribution agreement and the license agreements.  Tandy
    offered InterTAN interim license agreements which expired
    July 22, 1993, unless extended.  The agreements were extended
    on July 23, 1993.

       On July 30, 1993 Trans World Electronics, Inc. ("Trans
    World"), a subsidiary of Tandy, reached agreement with
    InterTAN's banking syndicate to buy approximately $42,000,000
    of InterTAN's debt at a negotiated, discounted price.  The
    closing of this purchase occurred on August 5, 1993, at which
    time Tandy resumed limited shipments to InterTAN and granted
    a series of short-term, interim licenses pending the
    execution of new license and merchandise agreements.  The
    debt purchased from the banks has been restructured into a
    seven-year note with interest of 8.64% due semiannually
    beginning February 25, 1994 and semiannual principal payments
    beginning February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).  Trans
    World provided approximately $10,000,000 in working capital
    and trade credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the working
    capital loan (the "Series B" note) of 8.11% is due
    semiannually beginning February 25, 1994 with the principal
    due in full on August 25, 1996.  Trans World also has
    received warrants with a five-year term exercisable for
    approximately 1,450,000 shares of InterTAN common stock at an
    exercise price of $6.618 per share.  As required by an
    agreement with Tandy, InterTAN has registered the warrants
    under the Securities Act of 1933.  At December 31, 1994,
    InterTAN's common stock price, as quoted in the Wall Street
                                                    -----------
    Journal, was $8.125 per share.  The fair market value of
    -------
    these warrants at December 31, 1994 approximates $2,500,000.

       In addition to the bank debt purchased by Trans World and
    the working capital loan, InterTAN's obligations to Trans
    World included two additional notes for approximately
    $23,665,000 (the "Series C" note) and $24,037,000 (the
    "Series D" note) with interest rates of 7.5% and 8%,
    respectively.  The notes represented the restructuring of
    InterTAN accounts payable for merchandise already shipped and
    required monthly interest payments.  All principal and
    interest on the Series C note was paid in full by December
    31, 1993.  The Series D note was paid in full during the
    first quarter of 1994.  All of Tandy's debt from InterTAN is
    secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of
    InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K.

      A new merchandise agreement was reached with InterTAN in
    October 1993 which requires future purchase orders to be
    backed by letters of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license
    agreements provide for a future royalty to Tandy.  InterTAN
    had obligations for purchase orders outstanding for
    merchandise ordered by A&A for InterTAN but not yet shipped
    totaling approximately $24,705,000 at December 31, 1994.

       InterTAN has increased its bank revolving credit facility
    with its new banking syndicate to Canadian $60,000,000 (U.S.
    $42,774,000 equivalent at December 31, 1994).  In the case of
    InterTAN's default on the bank credit line, Tandy will, at
    the option of InterTAN's new banking syndicate, purchase
    InterTAN's inventory and related accounts receivable at 50%
    of their net book value, up to the amount of outstanding bank
    loans, but not to exceed Canadian $60,000,000.  In that
    event, Tandy could foreclose on its first priority lien on
    InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K.  If Tandy fails to
    purchase the inventory and related accounts receivable of
    InterTAN from the banking syndicate, the syndicate upon
    notice to Tandy and expiration of time, can foreclose upon
    InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K. ahead of Tandy.  The
    inventory repurchase agreement between InterTAN's banking
    syndicate and Tandy has been amended and restated to reflect
    the foregoing.

       As of December 31, 1994 InterTAN owed Tandy an aggregate
    of $39,965,000, net of discount.  The current portion of the
    obligation approximates $8,707,000 and the non-current
    portion approximates $31,258,000.  In 1994 Tandy recognized
    $3,855,000 in accretion of discount on the note receivable
    from InterTAN which resulted from the purchase of the bank
    debt at a discounted price.  Accretion of this discount is
    based on the effective interest rate method.  Tandy
    recognized sales to and commission income from InterTAN of
    approximately $19,764,000 and interest income of $8,280,000
    during fiscal 1994.  During the year ended December 31, 1993,
    Tandy recognized approximately $93,315,000 of sales to
    InterTAN and interest income of $3,085,000.  Tandy's sales to
    InterTAN totaled $90,130,000 during the six months ended
    December 31, 1992 and $171,126,000 during fiscal 1992.

       A&A will continue as the exclusive purchasing agent for
    InterTAN in the Far East on a commission basis.  Commencing
    in March 1994, only the purchasing agent commission and sales
    by Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN were recorded as
    sales and operating revenues.  InterTAN purchases from third
    parties through A&A are no longer recorded as sales,
    reflecting the arrangement under the new merchandise
    agreement.  Accordingly, sales by Tandy to InterTAN in 1994
    are considerably lower than in prior years; however, the
    earned income relating thereto was not materially different.

       Through February 1995 InterTAN has met all of its payment
    obligations to Tandy.  In addition, its operations have
    improved in fiscal 1995 as evidenced by its published net
    income for the six months ended December 31, 1994
    approximating $17,704,000 or $1.11 per fully diluted share as
    opposed to net income of $4,567,000 or $0.49 per fully
    diluted share for the same period in the prior year.  As a
    result, nothing has come to the attention of management which
    would indicate that InterTAN would not be able to continue to
    meet its payment obligations pursuant to the debt agreements
    with Tandy.

       Canadian tax authorities are reviewing InterTAN's Canadian
    subsidiary's 1987-89 tax returns.  The Company cannot
    determine whether the ultimate resolution of that review will
    have an effect on InterTAN's ability to meet its obligations
    to Tandy, but at the present, the Company believes that the
    ultimate resolution of this review will not impair InterTAN's
    ability to meet its obligations to Tandy.

    NOTE 23-QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)
       As the Company's operations are predominantly retail
    oriented, its business is subject to seasonal fluctuations
    with the December 31 quarter being the most significant in
    terms of sales and profits because of the Christmas selling
    season.

       During the quarter ended December 31, 1994, the Company
    recognized a restructuring charge of $89,071,000 for business
    restructuring relating to the closing of certain retail
    stores.  The Company also recognized a gain of $91,437,000
    relating to the sale of Computer City and Incredible Universe
    private label credit card portfolios and the transfer of the
    Company's legal obligations pursuant to extended service
    contracts.  See Notes 3 and 4 for further information.

       During the quarter ended December 31, 1993, the Company
    recognized a gain, net of tax, from discontinued operations
    of approximately $15,822,000.  This gain partially offset the
    after-tax charge of $70,000,000 previously taken in the June
    1993 quarter and reduced the loss on disposal of discontinued
    operations to approximately $54,178,000.  The gain resulted
    from the better than anticipated sales price received for
    O'Sullivan partially offset by additional foreign currency
    translation losses and below plan operating results of the
    divested companies during the divestment period, net of
    related income tax adjustments.  See Note 21 for further
    information on discontinued operations.

       During the quarter ended March 31, 1993, the Company
    adopted FAS 109 which changed the Company's method of
    accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to an
    asset and liability approach.  The adjustments to the January
    1, 1993 balance sheet to adopt FAS 109 totaled $13,014,000.
    This amount is reflected in 1993 net income as the cumulative
    effect of a change in accounting principle.  See Note 12 for
    further information on Change in Accounting Principle -
    Provision for Income Taxes.

       As discussed in detail in Note 2, income per share amounts
    and the weighted average of common and common equivalent
    shares outstanding for all quarters commencing with the
    quarter ending March 31, 1992 (quarter of issuance) through
    September 30, 1994 have been retroactively restated to
    reflect that the PERCS will convert into 11,816,000 shares of
    common stock.

    (a) Series B dividends for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 are not net of income tax benefits associated with
        unallocated shares in the TESOP in accordance with EITF Issue 92-3.
    (b) Effect of mandatory conversion of Series C preferred stock for the year ended December 31, 1993, the six months ended
        December 31, 1992 and the year ended June 30, 1992 have been restated to reflect the actual number of shares of common
        stock into which the Series C PERCS will be converted on March 10, 1995.
    (c) This calculation is submitted in accordance with Regulation S-K, Item 601(b)(11) although not required by footnote 2
        to paragraph 14 of APB Opinion No. 15 because it results in dilution of less than 3%.
    (d) For the year ended December 31, 1993 and the six months ended December 31, 1992 these items are antidilutive and thus
        are omitted from the calculation.
