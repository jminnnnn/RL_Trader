PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL
RadioShack Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1967. We primarily engage
in the  retail  sale of  consumer  electronic  goods and  services  through  our
RadioShack(R) store chain. Our strategy is to dominate cost-effective  solutions
to meet everyone's routine electronics needs and families' distinct  electronics
wants.  Throughout  this report,  the terms  "our," "we," "us" and  "RadioShack"
refer to RadioShack Corporation, including its subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2002, we operated 5,161 company  stores  located  throughout the
United States, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  These stores
average approximately 2,400 square feet and are located in major malls and strip
centers,  as well as  individual  storefronts.  Each  location  carries  a broad
assortment of both private label and third-party  branded products.  Our product
lines  include  electronic  parts,  batteries  and  accessories;   wireless  and
conventional  telephones;  audio and  video  equipment;  direct-to-home  ("DTH")
satellite  systems;  and personal  computers  and related  products,  as well as
specialized  products such as home air cleaners and unique toys. We also provide
consumers access to third-party  services such as cellular and PCS phone and DTH
satellite activation,  long distance telephone service, prepaid wireless airtime
and extended service plans. At December 31, 2002, we also had a network of 2,052
dealer/franchise outlets, including 58 located outside of the U.S. These outlets
provide private label and third-party  branded  products and services to smaller
communities.  The dealers are generally  engaged in other retail  operations and
augment  their  businesses  with our products and service  offerings.  Our sales
derived outside of the United States are not material.

Retail Support Operations. Our retail stores, along with our dealer outlets, are
supported by an established  infrastructure.  Below are the major  components of
this support structure.

     RadioShack International Procurement Limited Partnership ("RSIP") - RSIP,
     which is owned by us, serves our wide-ranging international import/export,
     sourcing, evaluation, logistics and quality control needs. While the
     majority of RSIP's activities support our business, they also provide
     services for outside customers.

     Consumer Electronics Manufacturing - We operate seven manufacturing
     facilities in the United States and one overseas manufacturing operation in
     the Asia Pacific region. These eight manufacturing facilities employed
     approximately 2,700 employees as of December 31, 2002. We manufacture a
     variety of products, primarily sold through our retail outlets, including
     telephony, antennas, wire and cable products, and a wide variety of "hard
     to find" parts and accessories for consumer electronics products.

     RadioShack.com - Products, services and information are available through
     our Web site www.radioshack.com. Online customers can purchase, return or
     exchange products available on our Web site or at their neighborhood
     RadioShack location.

     RadioShack Customer Support - Using state-of-the-art telephone and data
     networks, RadioShack Customer Support responds to more than 5.6 million
     phone calls and emails annually. The responses include answers to
     customers' unique requests for hard to find parts, batteries and
     accessories, customer service inquiries and direct sales requests related
     to our Web site and retail stores.

     RadioShack Installation Services ("RSIS") - RSIS, through its 47 field
     offices located in 25 states, designs, installs and maintains cabling
     systems for the transmission of video, voice and data, primarily for home
     use. RSIS, also known as AmeriLink Corporation ("AmeriLink"), provides
     these services to both RadioShack and other outside parties. Services for
     RadioShack consist primarily of customer DTH satellite system
     installations, but also include installations relating to broadband
     Internet access.

     RadioShack Service Centers - We maintain a service and support network to
     service the consumer electronics and personal computer retail industry in
     the U.S. At December 31, 2002, we had 47 RadioShack Service Centers in the
     U.S. and one in Puerto Rico that repair name brand and private label
     products sold through our various sales channels. We are also a
     vendor-authorized service provider for such leading manufacturers as
     Compaq, Sony, Hewlett-Packard, RCA/Thomson, Kyocera, Nokia, Samsung and LG
     Electronics, among others. We also perform repairs for third-party service
     centers and extended service plan providers.

     RadioShack Technology Services ("RSTS") - Our management information system
     architecture is composed of a distributed, online network of computers that
     links all stores, customer channels, delivery locations, service centers,
     credit providers, distribution facilities and our corporate offices into a
     fully integrated system. Each store has its own server to support the point
     of sale system. The majority of our company stores communicate through a
     broadband network, which provides efficient access to customer support
     data. This design also allows store management to track sales and/or
     inventory at the product, customer or sales associate level. RSTS provides
     the majority of our programming and systems analysis needs. In March 2003,
     RSTS combined with our People department to become "Organizational Enabling
     Services."

     Regional Distribution Centers - We have seven distribution centers that
     ship over one million cartons each month to our retail stores and
     dealer/franchise outlets. Two of these distribution centers also serve as
     fulfillment centers for our online purchasers.

SEASONALITY
As with other retailers, our net sales and operating revenues, operating profits
and cash flows are proportionally  greater during the winter holiday season than
during  other  periods  of  the  year.  There  is a  corresponding  pre-seasonal
inventory  build-up,  which requires  working capital related to the anticipated
increased  sales volume.  This is further  discussed  below under  "Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and  Results of  Operations"
("MD&A") in the section titled "Cash Flow and  Liquidity."  Also, see Note 28 of
the "Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements"  for our quarterly  data. We
expect such seasonality to continue.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
We own or are licensed to use many  trademarks  and service marks related to our
business in the United States and in foreign countries. Radio Shack, RadioShack,
RadioShack.com,  and "You've got questions.  We've got answers." are some of the
marks most widely used by us. We believe that the RadioShack  name and marks are
well  recognized  by consumers and that the name and marks are  associated  with
high-quality service. Our private label manufactured products are sold primarily
under  the  RadioShack  trademark.  We also  own  various  patents  relating  to
electronic products designed and manufactured by us. We believe that the loss of
the RadioShack name and RadioShack marks would be material to our business.

SUPPLIERS AND BRANDED RELATIONSHIPS
Our business strategy depends,  in part, upon our ability to offer private label
and  third-party  branded  products,  as well as  third-party  services,  to our
customers.  We utilize a large number of suppliers  located in various  parts of
the world to obtain raw  materials  and  private  label  merchandise.  We obtain
approximately   66%  of  our  products   domestically,   which   accounted   for
approximately  65% of our cost of products sold in 2002. We do not expect a lack
of  availability  of raw material or any single  private label product to have a
material impact on our operations. We have formed vendor and third-party service
provider  relationships with  well-recognized  companies,  and in the aggregate,
certain of these  relationships are important to our business and the loss of or
disruption in supply from them could have a material  adverse  effect on our net
sales and operating  revenues.  Additionally,  we have been limited from time to
time by various  vendors and  suppliers  strictly on an  economic  basis,  where
demand has exceeded supply. In the aggregate,  these  relationships  have or are
expected  to have a  significant  impact on both our  operations  and  financial
strategy.  Our  vendor  and  third-party  relationships  include  the  following
companies:

     Compaq Computer Corporation ("Compaq") - Compaq is the sole supplier of
     both desktop and laptop personal computers sold through our retail stores,
     participating dealer/franchise outlets and on our Web site.

     DIRECTV, Inc. ("DIRECTV") - We have a non-exclusive sales agency agreement
     with DIRECTV to sell DTH satellite systems and acquire subscribers for the
     multi-channel audio/video programming direct broadcast satellite services
     of DIRECTV in the U.S. We purchase DIRECTV compatible satellite receivers
     from Thomson Multimedia.

     EchoStar Satellite Corporation ("DISH Network") - We have a sales incentive
     agreement with DISH Network to acquire subscribers for the multi-channel
     audio/video programming direct broadcast satellite services of DISH Network
     in the U.S. This agreement allows us to provide our customers with an
     additional offering in DTH satellite services.

     Sprint Communications Company and Sprint PCS ("Sprint") - Through our
     telecommunications relationship with Sprint, our customers have access to
     wireless PCS telephones and service, prepaid calling cards and long
     distance telephone service, as well as residential telephones and related
     telephony products.

     Thomson Multimedia ("Thomson") - Thomson, which owns the RCA brand,
     supplies us with various RCA-branded audio and video components such as
     televisions, DTH satellite systems (to support our DIRECTV arrangement),
     VCRs, camcorders, DVD players, CD shelf systems and other digital
     entertainment products.

     Verizon Wireless ("Verizon") - Our relationship with the nation's largest
     wireless communications service provider permits approximately 4,300
     company stores to have a multiyear agreement with a single cellular service
     provider, which creates training, marketing, inventory, repair and other
     supply-chain synergies. We continue to offer cellular service in our other
     retail outlets through various cellular carriers in areas not covered by
     Verizon.

BACKLOG ORDERS
We have no material backlog of orders for the products or services that we sell.

COMPETITION
Due to rising consumer demand for wireless communications products and services,
as well as rapid consumer  acceptance of new digital  technology  products,  the
consumer  electronics  retail  business  continues  to  be  highly  competitive,
primarily driven by technology and product cycles.

In the consumer  electronics  retailing  business,  competitive  factors include
price,   product   availability,   quality  and  features,   consumer  services,
manufacturing  and distribution  capability,  brand reputation and the number of
competitors.  We compete in the sale of our products  and services  with several
retail formats.  Consumer  electronics  retailers  include both Circuit City and
Best Buy/MusicLand.  Department and specialty stores, such as Sears and The Home
Depot,  compete on a more  select  product  category  scale.  Sprint and Verizon
compete directly with us in the wireless department through their own retail and
online  presence.   Mass  merchants  such  as  Wal-Mart  and  Target  and  other
alternative channels of distribution, such as mail order and e-commerce, compete
with us on a more widespread basis. Numerous domestic and foreign companies also
manufacture  similar products to ours for other retailers,  which are sold under
nationally-recognized brand names or private labels.

Management  believes we have two  primary  factors  differentiating  us from our
competition.   The  first  is  our  extensive   physical  retail  presence  with
approximately  7,200  conveniently  located  retail  outlets in virtually  every
neighborhood  nationwide.  Our  specially  trained  sales  staff is  capable  of
providing  cost-effective solutions for our customers' routine electronics needs
and distinct  electronics  wants,  assisting  customers with service  activation
where applicable,  and assisting with the selection of appropriate  products and
accessories.

Our   relationships   with   well-recognized   companies   represent  our  other
differentiating  factor.  These  relationships  with such  companies  as Sprint,
Verizon,  Thomson (RCA) and Compaq,  among others,  augment the strong  position
that we have  historically  maintained  in our core product  categories  such as
batteries,   communications  equipment,   telephony,  antennas,  and  parts  and
accessories.  Additionally,  we are able to  leverage  name  brand  recognition,
marketing  efforts and advertising  campaigns with these vendors and also create
cross-revenue opportunities for repair service income, residual income, consumer
acquisition fees and rebates.

While  we  believe  we have an  effective  business  strategy,  we  cannot  give
assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future, given the
highly competitive nature of the consumer electronics retail business.  Also, in
light of the ever-changing  nature of the consumer  electronics retail industry,
we would be  adversely  affected  if our  competitors  were able to offer  their
products at  significantly  lower  prices.  Additionally,  we would be adversely
affected if our competitors were able to introduce innovative or technologically
superior  products  not yet  available  to us,  or if we were  unable  to obtain
certain  products  in a  timely  manner  or  for an  extended  period  of  time.
Furthermore,  our  business  would  be  adversely  affected  if we fail to offer
value-added  solutions or if our  competition  enhances their ability to provide
these value-added solutions.

Regarding the expansion of the Internet,  we do not believe e-commerce retailers
currently represent significant  competition because of our small average ticket
amount  and  the  availability  of  high  demand  products  in  virtually  every
neighborhood nationwide. This, however, could change and become significant over
time.  We further  believe that we are well  positioned  to meet the  increasing
competition  from  Internet  retailers  with our  www.radioshack.com  Web  site,
coupled with our extensive  physical retail presence,  service  capabilities and
wide assortment of consumer electronics products.

EMPLOYEES
As of  December  31,  2002,  we had  approximately  39,100  employees.  We hired
approximately  11,800 temporary retail employees for the holiday selling season;
however,  approximately 6,600 of these temporary employees remained at year-end.
Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements,  nor are they
members of labor unions.  We consider our relationship  with our employees to be
good.

included in this Form 10-K and is  incorporated  into this Item 2 by  reference.
The following items are discussed further on the referenced pages:

We lease, rather than own, most of our retail and service center facilities. Our
stores are located primarily in major shopping malls,  stand-alone  buildings or
shopping centers owned by other entities.  We lease all of the property on which
our  executive   offices  are  located  in  downtown  Fort  Worth,   Texas,  one
distribution center in the United States, and six administrative offices and one
manufacturing  plant in the Asia Pacific  region.  RSIS  headquarters  and field
offices are also leased. We own the property on which the other six distribution
centers are located and all of our manufacturing  facilities  located throughout
the United  States.  We also  beneficially  own land  purchased  in 2001 in Fort
Worth, Texas, on which our new corporate headquarters is being constructed. This
land is currently held on our behalf by a local  development  agency operated by
the City of Fort Worth to facilitate  various incentive programs provided by the
city.We  periodically  review  our  existing  distribution  centers  and  office
facilities  to  determine  if these spaces are adequate to meet our needsfor the
foreseeable future.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
We  have  various  pending  claims,  lawsuits,   disputes  with  third  parties,
investigations  and actions incident to the operation of our business.  Although
occasional  adverse  settlements or resolutions may occur and negatively  impact
earnings  in the year of  settlement,  it is our  opinion  that  their  ultimate
resolution will not have a materially adverse effect on our financial  condition
or liquidity.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
No  matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders  during the fourth
quarter of 2002.

Financial Statements and related Notes.

(1) Includes operations of Computer City, Inc. for eight months, due to the sale
    to CompUSA Inc. on August 31, 1998.
(2) Total debt includes capital leases and TESOP indebtedness. Capitalization is
    defined as total debt plus total stockholders' equity.
(3) Return on invested capital is defined as adjusted operating income divided
    by invested capital. Adjusted operating income is calculated by adding back
    goodwill charges and adding implied interest of 7% on operating leases to
    operating income; this total is then reduced by cash income taxes paid to
    arrive at adjusted operating income. Invested capital is the sum of working
    capital; property, plant and equipment, net; other assets, net; the present
    value of operating leases and accumulated goodwill amortization. When
    arriving at invested capital, working capital and other assets are reduced
    by accounts and notes receivable which we do not consider a normal part of
    our business. Return on invested capital is a financial measurement used by
    management to measure the return on investment decisions and is not a
    substitute for other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
(4) Earnings used in computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges consist of
    pre-tax earnings and fixed charges. Fixed charges are defined as interest
    expense related to debt, amortization expense related to deferred financing
    costs, and a portion of rental charges.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ("MD&A").

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
Matters  discussed  in  MD&A  and  in  other  parts  of  this  document  include
forward-looking  statements  within the meaning of the federal  securities laws.
This includes statements  concerning  management's plans and objectives relating
to  our   operations   or  economic   performance   and   related   assumptions.
Forward-looking  statements are made based on management's  current expectations
and beliefs concerning future events and,  therefore,  involve a number of risks
and uncertainties.  Management cautions that forward-looking  statements are not
guarantees and actual results could differ  materially  from those  expressed or
implied in the  forward-looking  statements.  Important factors that could cause
our actual results of operations or financial  condition to differ include,  but
are not necessarily limited, to the following factors.

General Business Factors
o    Changes in the national or regional U.S. economic conditions, including,
     but not limited to, recessionary trends, level of the equity markets,
     consumer credit availability, interest rates, inflation, consumers'
     disposable income and spending levels, job security and unemployment, and
     overall consumer confidence;
o    continuing terrorist activities in the U.S., as well as the international
     war on terrorism;
o    the disruption of international, national or regional transportation
     systems;
o    changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity exerted by
     current competitors and potential new competition from both retail stores
     and alternative methods or channels of distribution, such as e-commerce,
     telephone shopping services and mail order;
o    the lack of availability or access to sources of inventory;
o    changes in the financial markets that would reduce or eliminate access to
     longer term capital or short-term credit availability;
o    the inability to attract, retain and grow an effective management team in a
     dynamic environment or changes in the cost or availability of a suitable
     work force to manage and support our service-driven operating strategies;
o    the imposition of new restrictions or regulations regarding the sale of
     products and/or services we sell or changes in tax rules and regulations
     applicable to us;
o    the occurrence of severe weather events or natural disasters, which could
     destroy outlets or prohibit consumers from traveling to our retail
     locations, especially during the peak winter holiday season;

RadioShack Specific Factors
o    the failure to differentiate ourselves as an electronics specialty retailer
     in the U.S. marketplace;
o    the inability to successfully execute our solutions strategy to dominate
     cost-effective solutions to meet everyone's routine electronics needs and
     families' distinct electronics wants;
o    the inability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives, including
     our Anchor, Participatory and Opportunistic ("APOS") business model and
     emerging sales channels strategies, as well as new business arrangements
     which may be formed with other retailers, distributors and third-party
     service providers;
o    the inability to maintain profitable contracts or execute business plans
     with providers of third-party branded products and with service providers
     relating to cellular and PCS telephones and direct-to-home ("DTH")
     satellite programming;
o    the presence or absence of new services or products and product features in
     the merchandise categories we sell and unexpected changes in our actual
     merchandise sales mix;
o    the inability to collect the level of anticipated residual income,
     subscriber acquisition fees and rebates for products and third-party
     services offered by us;
o    the inability to successfully maintain our business arrangements, including
     those with Compaq, DIRECTV, DISH Network, Thomson/RCA, Sprint, and Verizon
     Wireless;
o    contingent lease obligations relating to our discontinued retail operations
     arising from a sub-lessee's failure to fulfill its lease commitments; or
o    the inability to establish and implement our internal and external supply
     chain initiatives.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our  consolidated  financial  statements  requires us to make
estimates that affect the reported values of assets,  liabilities,  revenues and
expenses.  Our estimates are based on  historical  experience  and various other
factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which  form  the  basis  for  our  conclusions.   We  continually  evaluate  the
information  used to make  these  estimates  as our  business  and the  economic
environment  changes. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial
statements,  but the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical
are as follows:

Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private
label and  third-party  branded  products and services to consumers.  Revenue is
recognized,  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product  returns,  when
delivery has occurred or services have been  rendered,  the sales price is fixed
or determinable,  and  collectibility is reasonably  assured.  Certain products,
such as wireless phones and satellite  systems,  require the customer to use the
services of a  third-party  service  provider.  In most cases,  the  third-party
service  provider will pay us a fee or commission  for obtaining a new customer,
as  well  as  a  monthly  recurring  residual  amount  based  upon  the  ongoing
arrangement  between the service  provider and the  customer.  Fee or commission
revenue,  net of estimated service  disconnects,  is generally recognized at the
time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third-party service provider.
Residual  income is  recognized  as earned under the terms of each contract with
the service  provider,  which is  typically  as the service  provider  bills its
customer.  Different  revenues would have been recorded if we had made different
assumptions or evaluations.  Material differences could result in the amount and
timing of our revenue for any period if actual returns, sales, fee or commission
revenue adjustments exceed our estimates.

Additionally,  our retail  operations offer repair service (i.e.,  non-warranty)
contracts on products sold. These contracts  generally  provide extended service
coverage for periods  ranging from 12 to 60 months.  We offer these contracts in
all but three states on behalf of an unrelated  third-party  obligor. We are not
considered the primary obligor on these contracts.  In these circumstances,  our
share of commission  revenue is recognized as income at the time the contract is
sold.  For the  contracts  offered in the three  states where we are the primary
obligor,  revenues from the sale of these contracts are recognized  ratably over
the term of the contracts.  Costs directly related to the sale of such contracts
are  deferred  and  charged  to cost of  products  sold  proportionately  as the
revenues are recognized.  A loss is recognized on extended service  contracts if
the sum of the expected  costs of providing  services  pursuant to the contracts
exceeds the related unearned revenue.

Receivables:  We record receivables based on the amount of revenue recognized as
described  above.  Our receivables  are primarily  comprised of amounts due from
certain  vendors,   third-party   service  providers,   dealer/franchisees   and
commercial  customers.  The carrying  amount of the  receivables  is continually
evaluated  based on the  likelihood  of  collection.  An allowance  for doubtful
accounts is established for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
vendors,  third-party  service  providers and  customers to make their  required
payments.  Factors  such as  these  parties'  creditworthiness,  payment  terms,
historical  results and economic  conditions  are  considered  when making these
decisions.  The actual  collection of  receivables  could be different  from our
recorded value. If any of these parties'  creditworthiness  deteriorates  beyond
our  expectations,  or if any of their  actual  defaults  exceed our  historical
experience,  material  charges  could be  required to our  selling,  general and
administrative expenses.

Inventory:  Inventory  is our largest  asset class.  Our  inventory is primarily
comprised of finished goods and is recorded at the lower of cost or market using
the average cost method.  We make estimates  regarding the carrying value of our
inventory on an item-by-item  basis. If the amount we expect to receive from the
sale of the  inventory  is less  than its  cost,  we write  down the cost of the
inventory to its estimated  realizable  value based on assumptions  about future
demand and market  conditions.  If actual market  conditions  are less favorable
than those  projected by  management,  or if  unexpected  changes in  technology
affect demand for certain  products,  we could be exposed to losses in excess of
our established reserves.

Accrued  Expenses:  The amount of liability we record for claims related to self
insurance,  warranty and pending litigation  requires us to make judgments about
the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We use our past history
and  experience,  as well as  other  specific  circumstances  surrounding  these
claims,  in evaluating  the amount of liability  that we should  record.  Actual
results  may  be  materially  different  from  these  estimates.  As  additional
information becomes available,  we assess the potential liability related to our
various claims and revise our estimates as  appropriate.  Such  revisions  could
materially impact our results of operations and financial position.

Income Taxes:  We are subject to income taxes in many  jurisdictions,  including
the U.S.,  states and  localities,  and abroad.  We must first  determine  which
revenues  and  expenses  should be included in each  taxing  jurisdiction.  This
process  involves the  estimation of our actual  current tax exposure,  together
with the assessment of temporary  differences resulting from differing treatment
of items for tax and  accounting  purposes.  These  differences in the timing of
deductions  result in deferred tax assets and  liabilities  that are recorded on
our balance sheet. If different judgments had been used, our tax liability could
have been materially different. If we prevail in matters for which accruals have
been  established  or are  required to settle  matters in excess of  established
accruals,  our  effective  tax rate for a particular  period could be materially
affected. Furthermore, if our actual results differ from estimated results or if
we adjust our  estimates  in the future such that we would not expect to realize
all or part of our net deferred tax assets, we may need to establish a valuation
allowance  against our  deferred  tax assets,  also  potentially  impacting  our
effective tax rate.

RETAIL OUTLETS
The table  below shows our retail  locations  broken  down  between  company and
dealer/franchise  outlets. While the dealer outlets represent  approximately 28%
of the RadioShack locations,  sales to  dealer/franchisees  are less than 10% of
our total net sales and operating revenues (see "Results of Operations" below).

See the preceding table for a reconciliation  of total retail sales to our total

2002 COMPARED WITH 2001

NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES

Sales  decreased  approximately  4.2% to $4,577.2  million in 2002 from $4,775.7
million in 2001.  This  decrease was  primarily the result of a 35.3% decline in
sales to our dealer/franchise  outlets in 2002, mainly due to the decline in DTH
unit sales. In addition,  we also had a 1% decrease in comparable  company store
sales due primarily to the decline of DTH unit sales and desktop computers,  but
offset  by  sales  increases  in  wireless  handsets  and  related  accessories.
Additionally, the number of company stores decreased slightly due to the closure
of 127 Cool Things @ Blockbuster test stores in early 2002,  despite the opening
of 34 company stores, net of store closures.  We expect a sales gain for 2003 as
discussed in further detail below.

Retail  support  operations  sales are  generated  from the outside sales of our
retail  support  operations,  consisting  primarily of  RadioShack  Installation
Services ("RSIS"), repair centers, and domestic and overseas manufacturing.  The
34.7%  decrease in retail support  operations  sales from 2001 to 2002 primarily
resulted from a $19.1 million decrease in 2002 domestic manufacturing sales, due
to large  Verizon  fixture sales in 2001,  and a $15.2 million  decrease in RSIS
sales as a result of our exit from the national commercial installation business
at the end of 2001.

Sales in the  wireless  communication  department,  which is made up of wireless
handsets (including related services),  accessories,  and wireless services such
as prepaid airtime and bill payments, increased 9.4% in dollars and increased to
31.3% of our total retail sales in 2002 from 27.7% in 2001.  This sales increase
was due to an increase  in sales of  wireless  handsets  and  accessories  which
resulted from our emphasis on national carrier  offerings with desirable product
features and  content,  such as color  screens,  photo  capability  and Internet
access.  Although we have previously experienced sales gains in this department,
we realize that the overall wireless industry is experiencing a slow-down in net
new customer activations. While there is no assurance that we can maintain these
sales gain levels, we believe our plans, if executed  successfully,  will result
in wireless sales increases.

Sales  in  the  wired  communication  department,   which  includes  residential
telephones,  answering machines and other related telephony products,  decreased
1.1% in dollars and increased slightly as a percentage of our total retail sales
to 8.5% in 2002 from 8.3% in 2001.  Increased sales of cordless  telephones were
more than offset by decreased sales of corded telephones. We anticipate sales in
this department will be relatively stable in 2003.

Sales in the  radio  communication  department  decreased  8.6% in  dollars  and
decreased  slightly as a  percentage  of our total  retail sales to 2.7% in 2002
from 2.8% in 2001. The decrease in this department was primarily the result of a
decrease in Family Radio Service  ("FRS") and CB radio sales,  scanner sales and
communication accessories,  partially offset by a sales increase in GPS devices.
We believe that this  department will experience a small sales gain in 2003 over
the prior year due to the  anticipated  introduction of new models in the second
half of the year.

Sales in the home entertainment department, which consists of all home audio and
video  end-products  and accessories,  including DTH hardware and  installation,
decreased  23.9% in dollars and  decreased as a  percentage  of our total retail
sales to 19.0% in 2002  from  24.2%  in 2001.  Substantially  all of the  dollar
decrease was attributable to a decrease in sales of satellite dishes and related
installations.  This  decrease was  partially  offset by increased  sales of DVD
players.  We expect that  satellite dish sales will continue to decline in 2003,
but at a reduced rate,  as compared to the prior year.  We  anticipate  that the
other  categories  within the home  entertainment  department will have gains to
offset this  decline,  resulting  in overall flat sales in this  department  for
2003.

Sales in the computer  department,  which  includes  desktop,  laptop,  handheld
computers  and related  accessories,  in  addition  to digital  cameras and home
networking products, decreased slightly in dollars and increased as a percentage
of our  total  retail  sales to 10.2% in 2002  from  9.9% in 2001.  These  sales
dollars  were  maintained  primarily  due to an  increase  in laptop  computers,
computer accessories and digital camera sales, offset by a decline in unit sales
of desktop CPUs and  monitors.  We expect that sales in the computer  department
will  increase  in  2003,  driven  by  sales of the  products  discussed  above,
particularly  digital  cameras  and  related  accessories,  with  this  increase
partially offset by a planned decrease in sales of desktop computers.

Sales in the power and technical  department increased 0.8% in dollars and also
as a  percentage  of our total retail sales to 13.9% in 2002 from 13.3% in 2001.
These  increases  were  primarily due to increased  sales of general and special
purpose batteries, partially offset by decreased sales of bulk and packaged wire
and technical parts. We anticipate a slight sales increase in this department in
2003.

Sales in the personal electronics,  toys and personal audio department increased
2.5% in dollars, as well as increasing as a percentage of our total retail sales
to 12.8% in 2002 from 12.1% in 2001,  due primarily to increased  sales of micro
radio controlled cars and related accessories,  in addition to unique giftables.
We expect  that  sales in this  department  will  continue  to grow in 2003 as a
result of our  additional  name brand  product  offerings  and our product line
increases in these areas.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit for 2002 was $2,238.3  million or 48.9% of net sales and  operating
revenues,  compared  with  $2,296.8  million or 48.1% of net sales and operating
revenues  in  2001.  Gross  profit  decreased  $58.5  million  or 2.5% in  2002,
primarily as a result of a 4.2%  decrease in net sales and  operating  revenues.
Despite this  decrease in gross  profit  dollars,  the gross  profit  percentage
increased from 48.1% to 48.9% in 2002, due primarily to an increase in the gross
profit percentage in the home entertainment  department and, to a lesser extent,
increases in both the power and technical and computer departments' gross profit
percentages.Our  gross  profit  percentage  increase  was  partially  offset  by
reductions in both the wireless and wired departments' gross profit percentages,
compounded by the increase in the wireless communication department's percent of
total retail sales.  The reduction in gross profit dollars was partially  offset
by a  decrease  in the  total  retail  sales  mix  for  the  home  entertainment
department,  which has a lower gross profit  percentage than our overall average
gross profit percentage,  as well as an increase in gross profit dollars for the
power  and  technical  department.  Additionally,  the gross  profit  percentage
improved for our retail  support  operations in 2002.  We anticipate  that gross
profit as a percentage of net sales and  operating  revenues will improve by the
end of 2003, when compared to 2002, enhanced by sales mix changes towards higher
margin products,  such as computer  accessories,  batteries,  toys, and personal
audio and electronics,  and also enhanced by improved efficiencies realized from
supply  chain  management  initiatives,  particularly  in vendor  relations  and
end-of-life inventory management.

                                $1,728.6   37.8%    $1,713.9   35.9%    $1,632.6   34.1%
                                =================   =================   =================
</TABLE>

Our SG&A  expense  increased  0.9% in dollars and  increased as a percent of net
sales and operating revenues to 37.8% for the year ended December 31, 2002, from
35.9% for the year ended  December  31, 2001.  The dollar  increase for 2002 was
primarily due to a $29.0 million  litigation charge related to the settlement of
a class  action  lawsuit in  California  and a $6.0  million  charge to our 1996
restructuring  reserve as a result of the bankruptcy of a sub-lessee in a former
Incredible Universe store site. A $14.6 million increase in our rent expense and
lower overall  sales in 2002 also  contributed  to a higher SG&A expense  ratio.
This was partially  offset by a $7.6 million charge for store closing costs from
2001, which did not reoccur in 2002.

Payroll  expense  decreased  by $12.3  million to $728.0  million  in 2002,  but
increased  slightly as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to 15.9% in
2002,  compared to 15.5% in 2001.  The decrease in dollars was due  primarily to
our reduction in headcount during the third quarter of 2001.

Rent expense  increased by $14.6 million to $244.9 million in 2002 and increased
as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues  to 5.4% in 2002 from 4.8% in
2001.  These  increases were due primarily to lease renewals and  relocations at
higher rates,  as well as a slight increase in the average store size. We expect
a similar increase in 2003 rent for the same reasons described for the 2002 rent
increase.

Advertising  expense  decreased  $12.9  million in 2002 to $241.0  million  from
$253.9  million in 2001,  while  remaining at 5.3%  percentage of net sales and
operating  revenues  during  both 2002 and 2001.  The  dollar  decrease  was due
primarily to an increase in advertising  contributions  from our various vendors
and third-party service providers.

Insurance  expense  increased  $10.4 million to $71.0 million in 2002 from $60.6
million in 2001 and increased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues
to 1.6% in 2002,  compared to 1.3% in 2001.  Substantially  all of our insurance
expense  relates  to our  self-insurance  programs.  We  maintain  reserves  for
self-insurance  liabilities  related to our group  medical and casualty  losses,
which include general and product liability and workers'  compensation.  In some
cases,  risks are  insured  through  outside  carriers  for  losses in excess of
self-insured amounts.  These reserves are adjusted to reflect estimates based on
historical experience, estimated claims incurred but not reported, the impact of
risk management  programs and the estimated  effect of external  factors.  As of
December 31, 2002,  actual losses had not exceeded our  expectations.  We expect
insurance expense to continue to increase in both dollars and as a percentage of
net sales and  operating  revenues  due to the rising  health  care costs in the
U.S., in addition to increases in premiums  resulting from the recent  terrorist
activities.

In 2003,  we expect SG&A expense to increase  slightly in dollars,  but decrease
slightly as a percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues due to increased
sales volume.


DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

Depreciation and amortization  expense  decreased $13.6 million dollars to $94.7
million and decreased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 2.0%
in 2002 from 2.3% in 2001.  These  decreases are primarily  attributable  to the
elimination   of  goodwill   amortization   related  to  AmeriLink   Corporation
("AmeriLink),  as well as the  sale of our  corporate  headquarters  during  the
fourth  quarter of 2001.  We expect  depreciation  and  amortization  expense to
increase slightly in 2003, due to depreciation  increases  associated with store
fixtures and  capitalized  software  related to inventory  management  and other
information systems projects.

GAIN ON CONTRACT TERMINATION

RadioShack  and  Microsoft  mutually  agreed  during  2002  to  terminate  their
agreement  and settle the  remaining  commitments  each had to one another.  The
termination  of this agreement took effect at the start of the fourth quarter of
2002, upon satisfaction of several  contractual  obligations.  The net financial
result was an $18.5 million gain (principally  cash received),  driven primarily
by the settlement of a multi-year obligation Microsoft had to connect our stores
with broadband capabilities.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

As a result of continued  difficulties  in the DTH business and a refocus during
the fourth  quarter on our  satellite  installation  strategy,  together  with a
revised  cash  flow  projection  for  our  overall  installation   business,  we
determined  that the  remaining  long-lived  assets  associated  with  RSIS were
impaired.  We compared the carrying value of these long-lived  assets with their
fair value and determined  that the remaining  goodwill  balance of $8.1 million
was impaired and we, therefore,  recorded an impairment charge of this amount in
the accompanying 2002 Consolidated Statement of Income. As of December 31, 2002,
there was no remaining  goodwill  balance on our balance sheet relating to RSIS.
See the discussion  below under the section titled "2001 Compared With 2000" for
further discussion of the RSIS business.

LOSS ON SALE OF ASSETS

There  were no losses on the sale of assets in 2002.  For  information  on prior
year losses,  see the  discussion  below under the section titled "2001 Compared
With 2000."

EMPLOYEE SEPARATION AND OTHER COSTS

There were no employee  separation or other costs in 2002.  For  information  on
prior year employee  separation and other costs,  see the discussion below under
the section titled "2001 Compared With 2000."

NET INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $34.4  million for 2002 versus
$37.8 million for 2001.

Interest expense  decreased to $43.4 million in 2002 from $50.8 million in 2001.
This  decrease  was  primarily  the result of a reduction  in the  average  debt
outstanding  throughout  2002. In addition,  our interest rate swap  instruments
also lowered overall interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002, when
compared to the same prior year period.  Interest income decreased almost 31% to
$9.0  million in 2002 from $13.0  million in 2001,  due  primarily  to CompUSA's
early  payment  of its  note  to us on  June  22,  2001,  which  eliminated  the
associated interest income.

Interest income,  including  accretion of discount as applicable,  earned on the
amounts  outstanding  during the three years ended  December 31, 2002,  2001 and
2000 was as follows:

                                Year Ended December 31,
                             ------------------------------
(In millions)                  2002       2001       2000
- -------------                --------   --------   --------
CompUSA note receivable      $  --      $  6.1     $ 12.9
Other (includes short-term
Investment interest)            9.0        6.9        4.9
                             --------   --------   --------
Total interest income        $  9.0     $ 13.0     $ 17.8
                             ========   ========   ========

Interest  expense,  net of interest income,  is expected to be flat during 2003,
when compared to 2002.

OTHER INCOME

In the second quarter of 2002, we received payments and recorded income of $27.7
million  in  partial  settlement  of  amounts  owed to us  under  a tax  sharing
agreement  that was the subject of an arbitration  which  commenced in July 1999
and was styled Tandy  Corporation  and T.E.  Electronics,  L.P.  vs.  O'Sullivan
Industries  Holdings,  Inc.  ("O'Sullivan").  The  arbitration  ruling  requires
O'Sullivan  to comply with the tax sharing  agreement  that was entered  into by
theparties at the time of O'Sullivan's initial public offering.

During the second half of 2002,  we received two payments  totaling $6.2 million
relating to quarterly  payments under the tax sharing agreement with O'Sullivan.
Future payments will vary based on the level of O'Sullivan's future earnings. In
the near term,  we expect that the  quarterly  payments  to us will  approximate
those received to date; however,  these payments are dependent upon O'Sullivan's
overall financial  condition and ability to pay.  Consequently,  there can be no
assurances  that we will receive timely each payment that may be due to us under
the tax sharing agreement.

PROVISION FOR LOSS ON INTERNET-RELATED INVESTMENT

There were no losses on Internet-related investments in 2002. For information on
prior year losses on  Internet-related  investments,  see the  discussion  below
under the section titled "2001 Compared With 2000."

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

Our  provision for income taxes  reflects an effective  income tax rate of 38.0%
for 2002 and 42.8% for 2001. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2002 when
compared to 2001 was the result of the 2001  impairment of RSIS goodwill,  which
was not deductible for tax purposes and caused the increased  effective tax rate
in 2001. For further  information,  see the  discussion  below under the section
titled "2001 Compared With 2000." We anticipate  that the effective tax rate for
2003 will be approximately 38.0%.

2001 COMPARED WITH 2000

NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES

Sales decreased  slightly to $4,775.7  million in 2001 from $4,794.7  million in
2000.  This  decrease  was  primarily  the  result of a decline  in sales to our
dealer/franchise  outlets  in  2001,  partially  offset  by  a  1%  increase  in
comparable  company  store sales and the opening of 18 new stores,  net of store
closures.  Sales in the wireless  communication  department  increased  14.5% in
dollars and increased to 27.7% of total retail sales in 2001 from 24.3% in 2000.
This sales  increase  was due to an  increase  in sales of  wireless  phones and
accessories,  offset  somewhat by a decrease in prepaid  wireless  airtime.  The
wired communication department, which includes residential telephones, answering
machines and other related  telephony  products,  decreased  8.7% in dollars and
decreased  as a  percentage  of total  retail sales to 8.3% in 2001 from 9.1% in
2000.  The decrease in this  department  was  primarily  the result of declining
sales of residential telephones,  and was partially offset by increased sales of
telephone  accessories.  The radio  communication  department  decreased 8.5% in
dollars and decreased as a percentage of total retail sales to 2.8% in 2001 from
3.1% in 2000.  The decrease in this  department  was  primarily  the result of a
decrease in CB radio and scanner sales. The home entertainment department, which
consists of all home audio and video  products,  including  DTH  satellites  and
installation  services,  decreased  slightly in dollars and as a  percentage  of
total retail sales to 24.2% in 2001 from 24.4% in 2000. This dollar decrease was
primarily  attributable  to a decrease in sales of satellite  dishes,  which was
partially offset by increased sales of video and cable accessories. The computer
department,  which  includes not only  computers  and related  accessories,  but
narrow and broadband  connectivity,  as well as home  automation and networking,
decreased  16.3% in dollars and  decreased as a percentage of total retail sales
to 9.9% in 2001 from 11.9% in 2000. These decreases were primarily  attributable
to a 26%  decline  in unit  sales of CPUs  and an 11%  decrease  in the  average
selling price of CPUs from the prior year.  The power and  technical  department
increased 2.0% in dollars and increased slightly as a percentage of total retail
sales to 13.3% in 2001 from 13.1% in 2000. These increases were primarily due to
increased sales of special purpose batteries. The personal electronics, toys and
personal audio department  decreased 5.4% in dollars, as well as decreasing as a
percentage  of total  retail  sales to 12.1%  in 2001  from  12.8% in 2000,  due
primarily to decreased sales of toys and giftables.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross  profit in 2001 was $2,296.8  million or 48.1% of net sales and  operating
revenues,  compared  with  $2,369.6  million or 49.4% of net sales and operating
revenues in 2000. Gross profit for 2001 was reduced by a $26.2 million charge in
the fourth  quarter for a write-down of  non-strategic  inventory  product lines
which we intend to exit. In addition, the decline in the gross profit percentage
from 49.4% to 48.1% was affected by a decrease in the wired  communication gross
margin.  This gross profit  decrease was  partially  offset by a decrease in the
total  retail  sales mix for the  computer  department,  which has a lower gross
margin  than our overall  average  gross  margin,  as well as an increase in the
computer  department  gross  profit  percentage.  Increases  in the gross profit
percentage for the wireless  communication and power and technical  departments,
coupled  with an increase in the  departments'  gross profit  percentages,  also
favorably affected the overall gross profit percentage.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

Our SG&A  expense  increased  5.0% in dollars and  increased as a percent of net
sales and operating revenues to 35.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001, from
34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2000.  This 1.8 percentage  point increase
in the SG&A  percentage  in 2001 was  primarily  attributable  to an increase in
advertising expense during 2001, without  proportional sales growth. An increase
in the rent expense in 2001 also contributed to the SG&A expense increase.

Payroll  expense  decreased  by $8.4  million  to  $740.3  million  in 2001  and
decreased  as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues  to 15.5% in 2001,
compared to 15.6% in 2000.  These decreases were due primarily to a reduction in
our labor force during 2001 and reduced  incentive pay resulting from a decrease
in operating  income.  Advertising  expense  increased  $26.8  million to $253.9
million  and  increased  to 5.3% as a  percentage  of net  sales  and  operating
revenues in 2001, compared to $227.1 million and 4.7% of sales in 2000. Both the
dollar and  percentage  point  increases  were due  primarily  to a decrease  in
advertising  contributions  from our  various  vendors and  third-party  service
providers and, to a lesser extent,  an increase in TV commercials.  Rent expense
increased by $15.1 million to $230.3  million in 2001 and increased as a percent
of net sales and operating  revenues to 4.8% in 2001 from 4.5% in 2000. The rent
increase was partially due to new company store openings throughout the year, as
well  as the  addition  of the  Cool  Things  @  Blockbuster  test  stores.  The
relocation of existing stores to larger locations, as well as a renewal of store
leases at higher rates, also contributed to the rent expense increase.  Bad debt
expense  increased by $10.9  million to $14.5 million in 2001 and increased as a
percentage  of net sales  and  operating  revenues  to 0.3% in 2001 from 0.1% in
2000.  The bad debt  increase was  primarily  related to both  bankruptcies  and
uncollected accounts  receivable,  as well as the write-off of a note receivable
from Digital:Convergence Corporation ("DC"). Store closing costs of $7.6 million
in  2001  relate  to the  closure  of 35  underperforming  stores  prior  to the
expiration of their leases.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

Depreciation and amortization  expense  increased $1.0 million dollars to $108.3
million and increased as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues to 2.3%
in 2001  from  2.2%  in  2000.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AmeriLink,  also  known  as  RSIS,  was  acquired  in  1999 to  provide  us with
residential installation  capabilities for the technologies and services offered
in our retail stores. Since its acquisition,  RSIS has incurred operating losses
and negative cash flows.  In 2000 and in 2001, we attempted to  restructure  and
reorganize  RSIS, but due to the overall  slowdown in the economy and the market
decline for professionally  installed home Internet connectivity services,  RSIS
continued to report  losses.  During the fourth  quarter of 2001,  we prepared a
revised  analysis of estimated  future cash flows for RSIS, which indicated that
its  long-lived  assets were impaired.  The carrying value of RSIS's  long-lived
assets  (principally  goodwill and fixed assets) exceeded the discounted present
value of the estimated  future cash flows by  approximately  $37.0  million.  An
impairment  of  goodwill  for that  amount  was  recorded  and  included  in the
accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income.

Our   test    concept    with    Blockbuster    to    introduce   a   RadioShack
"store-within-a-store"  at Blockbuster locations did not provide sufficient cash
flows to  recover  our  investment  in  fixtures  and  other  fixed  assets.  An
impairment  loss of $2.8  million was  recorded  for those assets in 2001 and is
included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

LOSS ON SALE OF ASSETS

In the fourth  quarter of 2001,  we sold and leased  back most of our  corporate
headquarters  at a loss of $44.8 million.  On June 22, 2001, we received  $123.6
million for the  settlement of the purchase  price and  settlement of the $136.0
million note which was received in  connection  with the sale of Computer  City,
Inc. in 1998.  Thus,  we incurred an  additional  loss from the sale of Computer
City, Inc. of $12.4 million.

EMPLOYEE SEPARATION AND OTHER COSTS

During  the third  quarter of 2001,  as part of our effort to control  operating
costs, we incurred approximately $13.5 million in charges related to a reduction
of our  labor  force,  primarily  for  early  retirements  and  involuntary  and
voluntary employee  severance.  In addition,  during the fourth quarter of 2001,
$4.8 million in charges were incurred relating to the closure of RSIS's national
commercial  installation  business.  These  costs were  primarily  comprised  of
severance   costs,   write-offs   of  certain  fixed  assets  and  future  lease
commitments.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $37.8  million for 2001 versus
$36.1 million for 2000.

Interest expense decreased to $50.8 million in 2001, from $53.9 million in 2000.
This  decrease  was  primarily  the result of a  decrease  in the  average  debt
outstanding  throughout  2001.  Interest  income  decreased  almost 27% to $13.0
million in 2001 from $17.8  million  in 2000,  due  primarily  to  repayment  of
various notes  receivable  associated  with our exit of other retail  formats in
previous years.

PROVISION FOR LOSS ON INTERNET-RELATED INVESTMENT

During the second  quarter of 2000, we made a $30.0 million  investment in DC, a
privately-held  Internet  technology  company.  In the first quarter of 2001, we
concluded that our  investment  had  experienced a decline in value that, in our
opinion,  was other than temporary.  This conclusion was based on DC's inability
to secure  sufficient  additional  funding  or to  complete  an  initial  public
offering. As such, we recorded a loss provision equal to our initial investment.
DC subsequently filed for bankruptcy on March 22, 2002.






PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes  reflects an effective tax rate of 42.8% for 2001
and 38.0% for  2000.  The  increase  in the  effective  tax rate in 2001 was the
result  of the  impairment  of RSIS  goodwill  discussed  above,  which  was not
deductible for tax purposes.

IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In August  2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 143,  "Accounting for
Asset  Retirement  Obligations,"  which is effective for fiscal years  beginning
after June 15, 2002. SFAS No. 143 establishes financial accounting and reporting
standards for obligations  associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and the  associated  asset  retirement  costs.  We  adopted  SFAS No. 143
effective  January 1, 2003.  We do not believe the standard will have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

On June 28, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal  Activities."  SFAS No. 146 addresses  significant  issues
relating to the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs associated with
exit and disposal activities,  including restructuring activities, and nullifies
the guidance in Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3,  "Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)."  The provisions
of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal  activities  initiated  after
December 31, 2002.  Retroactive  application of SFAS No. 146 is prohibited  and,
accordingly, liabilities recognized prior to the initial application of SFAS No.
146 should  continue to be accounted for in  accordance  with EITF 94-3 or other
applicable  preexisting  guidance.  We adopted SFAS No. 146 effective January 1,
2003. We do not believe the standard will have a material  adverse effect on our
consolidated financial statements.

In December  2002,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and  Disclosure."  This Statement amends SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,"  to provide  alternative  methods of
transition  for a voluntary  change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee  compensation.  In addition,  this Statement amends the
disclosure  requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent  disclosures about
the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of
the method used on reported results.  We adopted the disclosure  requirements of
SFAS No. 148 effective December 31, 2002, and we made no material adjustments as
a result of this adoption.

In December 2002, the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. ("FIN") 45,  "Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements for Guarantees,  Including Guarantees of
Indebtedness  of Others." FIN 45 is effective for guarantees  issued or modified
after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements were effective for the year
ended  December 31,  2002,  and expand the  disclosures  required by a guarantor
about its obligations under a guarantee.  FIN 45 also requires that we recognize
guarantees  entered into or modified after December 31, 2002, as a liability for
the fair value of the  obligation  undertaken in the issuance of the  guarantee.
FIN 45 became  effective  January 1, 2003. We do not believe the  interpretation
will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2003,  the FASB issued FIN 46,  "Consolidation  of Variable  Interest
Entities - An Interpretation  of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 addresses  consolidation by
business   enterprises   of  variable   interest   entities  that  have  certain
characteristics.   The  consolidation   requirement  of  FIN  46  is  applicable
immediately to variable  interest entities created or obtained after January 31,
2003.  For variable  interest  entities  acquired  before  February 1, 2003, the
consolidation  requirement  of FIN 46 is applicable to us as of July 1, 2003. We
believe  the  adoption  of  FIN  46  will  not  have a  material  impact  on our
consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002,  the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 02-16,  "Accounting
for Consideration  Received from a Vendor by a Customer (Including a Reseller of
the Vendor's  Products)." EITF 02-16 provides guidance on how cash consideration
received by a customer  from a vendor  should be  classified  in the  customer's
statement of income. EITF 02-16 is effective  prospectively for new arrangements
entered into after  December 31, 2002 and income  statements  for prior  periods
presented should be reclassified to comply with its consensus.  We are analyzing
the  provisions  of EITF 02-16 as they relate to our  accounting  policies.  The
impact,  if any, of  compliance  with the  consensus  on EITF 02-16 has not been
determined at this time.

CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY

                            Year Ended December 31,
                        -------------------------------
(In millions)              2002       2001       2000
- -------------            --------   --------   --------
Operating activities     $ 521.6    $ 775.8    $ 116.5
Investing activities       (99.0)      (2.3)    (134.0)
Financing activities      (377.5)    (502.8)     (16.4)

In 2002, cash flow provided by operating activities was $521.6 million, compared
to $775.8 million and $116.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

At December 31, 2002, changes in accounts  receivable,  consisting  primarily of
amounts due from our various vendors and third party service providers, provided
$68.2  million in cash during  2002,  when  compared to $165.8  million from the
prior year.  Cash  provided by accounts  receivable  in 2002 and 2001 was due to
further   reductions   of  vendor   and   service   provider   receivables   and
dealer/franchise  receivables  as a result of an increase in  collections  after
increases in such balances in 2000.

At December 31, 2002,  changes in  inventory  used $21.4  million in cash during
2002,  compared to $213.9 million of cash provided  during 2001. The increase in
inventory  since  December 31, 2001,  was  primarily  the result of increases in
laptop computers,  home theater-in-a-box  systems, and televisions,  as sales of
these  products were less than  anticipated.  These  increases in inventory were
partially offset by a reduction in wireless handsets.

Typically,  our annual cash  requirements  for pre-seasonal  inventory  build-up
range between $200.0 million and $400.0  million.  The funding  required by this
build-up comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and
operating  revenues.  We had $446.5  million in cash and cash  equivalents as of
December 31, 2002, as a resource for our funding  needs.  Additional  capital is
available  under our $600.0 million dollar  commercial  paper program,  which is
supported  by a bank  credit  facility  which could be utilized in the event the
commercial  paper  market is  unavailable  to us. We  currently  do not  expect,
however, that the commercial paper market would be unavailable to us and that we
would have to utilize the credit  facility.  As of December 31, 2002,  we had no
commercial paper outstanding or utilization of our credit facility.

Additionally,  during the year ended  December 31, 2002,  $118.8 million more in
cash was  provided by changes in accounts  payable,  when  compared to the prior
year period, due primarily to more favorable vendor terms.

Cash used in investing  activities in 2002 was $99.0  million,  compared to $2.3
million and $134.0 million used in 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Our cash usage
in investing  activities was higher in 2002 than 2001,  primarily because of the
$123.6 million we received  during the second quarter of 2001 for the settlement
of the  purchase  price of Computer  City and  settlement  of the CompUSA  note.
Capital  expenditures were $106.8 million in 2002, compared to $139.2 million in
2001 and  $119.6  million in 2000.  Capital  expenditures  for these  years were
primarily  for  our  retail  store  expansions  and  remodels  and  upgrades  of
information  systems.  In  addition,  we  purchased  land  in  2001  for our new
corporate headquarters building, which totaled $18.3 million. We anticipate that
our  capital  expenditure  requirements  for 2003 will be  approximately  $210.0
million to $230.0  million.  The $100.0  million  increase  over 2002  primarily
relates to our new  corporate  headquarters.  See further  discussion of the new
facilities,  below  in the  section  titled  "Capital  Structure  and  Financial
Condition."  Store  remodels and  relocations  and updated  information  systems
account for the balance of our  anticipated  2003  capital  expenditures.  As of
December 31, 2002,  we had $446.5  million in cash and cash  equivalents.  These
cash and cash  equivalents,  along  with cash  generated  from our net sales and
operating  revenues  and,  if  necessary,  both  our  short-term  and  long-term
financing facilities, are available to fund future capital expenditure needs.

Cash used in financing activities was $377.5 million in 2002, compared to $502.8
million  and  $16.4  million  in 2001 and  2000,  respectively.  We used  $329.9
million,  $308.3 million and $400.6 million for the repurchase of our common and
preferred  stock in 2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Repurchases  of common
stock were made under our share repurchase and employee stock plans. See further
discussion of our stock repurchase programs below in the section titled "Capital
Structure and Financial  Condition." The 2002,  2001 and 2000 stock  repurchases
were  partially  funded by $49.6  million,  $53.7  million  and  $66.3  million,
respectively,  received from the sale of treasury  stock to employee stock plans
and to a lesser  extent from stock option  exercises.  The balance of capital to
repurchase shares was obtained from cash generated from operations. We purchased
all of  Microsoft's  preferred  units in  RadioShack.com  LLC for $88.0  million
during the third quarter of 2001.  We also received  $32.3 million from the sale
and lease-back of our corporate technology  center  building  during the second
quarter of 2002. This transaction was recorded as a financing  obligation due to
responsibilities which we retain during the lease period. Dividends paid, net of
tax, in 2002,  2001 and 2000 amounted to $39.8 million,  $43.7 million and $44.7
million,   respectively.   The  long-term  notes  we  issued  in  2001  provided
approximately  $346.1  million in cash,  the majority of which was used to repay
short-term  debt. In 2000, the increase in short-term debt was used primarily to
fund  increases  in  accounts  receivable,   stock  repurchases  and  additional
inventory.

Our free  cash  flow,  defined  as cash  flow  from  operating  activities  less
dividends  paid and  additions  to  property,  plant and  equipment,  was $375.0
million in 2002,  compared to $592.9  million in 2001. We believe free cash flow
is an  appropriate  indication  of  the  corporation's  ability  to  fund  share
repurchases, repay maturing debt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of
capital that  management  believes  will  enhance  shareholder  value.  The 2002
decrease in free cash flow,  compared to 2001,  was due primarily to an increase
in the 2002 working  capital  components,  principally  inventory,  as described
above. We expect free cash flow to be approximately  $200.0 to $250.0 million in
2003. The anticipated  decrease in free cash flow from 2002 to 2003 is primarily
related to the increase in 2003 capital expenditures noted above. The comparable
financial  measure  to free cash  flow  under  GAAP is cash flow from  operating
activities,  which was $521.6  million  and $775.8  million  for the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Management  considers our financial  structure and condition  solid. At December
31, 2002,  total  capitalization  was  $1,355.4  million,  consisting  of $627.3
million of debt and $728.1  million of equity and  resulting in a  debt-to-total
capitalization  ratio of 46.3%,  which was equal to the prior year debt-to-total
capitalization  ratio.  The ratio  remained  the same as the  prior  year due to
proportional decreases in debt of $43.6 million and equity of $50.0 million from
2001.

Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 43.6% at December 31,
2002,  compared to 39.0% at December 31,  2001,  and 18.2% at December 31, 2000.
This increase in 2002 was due to the  financing  obligation  resulting  from the
sale  and  lease-back  of our  corporate  technology  center  building  and  the
reduction of equity.

Our debt is considered  investment grade by the rating  agencies.  There were no
changes to our debt ratings  during the year.  Below are their latest ratings by
category.

                                              Standard
           Category              Moody's     and Poor's     Fitch

Our debt primarily  consists of  medium-term  notes and two issuances of 10-year
long-term notes.

We  have a  $300.0  million  Debt  Shelf  Registration  Statement  ("1997  Shelf
Registration")  which became effective in August 1997. In August 1997, we issued
$150.0  million  of  10-year  unsecured  long-term  notes  under the 1997  Shelf
Registration.  The interest  rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum with  interest
payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 1998. These
notes are due September 1, 2007.

We also  issued,  in various  amounts and on various  dates from  December  1997
through September 1999, medium-term notes totaling $150.0 million under the 1997
Shelf Registration.  At December 31, 2002, $64.5 million of these notes remained
outstanding.  The interest rates at December 31, 2002, for the outstanding $64.5
million  medium-term notes ranged from 6.13% to 7.35% and had a weighted average
coupon rate of 6.86%.  These notes have maturities ranging from 2003 to 2008. As
of  December  31,  2002,  there  was  no  availability  under  this  1997  Shelf
Registration.

On May 11, 2001, we issued  $350.0  million of 10-year 7 3/8% notes in a private
offering to initial purchasers who offered the notes to qualified  institutional
buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual  interest rate on the notes is 7.375% per
annum with interest  payable on November 15 and May 15 of each year.  Payment of
interest on the notes  commenced on November  15, 2001,  and the notes mature on
May 15, 2011. In August 2001, under the terms of an exchange offering filed with
the SEC, we exchanged  substantially  all of these notes for a similar amount of
publicly registered notes. Because no additional debt was issued in the exchange
offering, the net effect of this exchange was that no additional debt was issued
on August 3, 2001, and  substantially  all of the notes are now registered  with
the SEC.

During the third  quarter of 2001,  we entered into several  interest  rate swap
agreements, with maturities ranging from 2004 to 2007, to manage our exposure to
interest  rate  movements by  effectively  converting a portion of our long-term
fixed rate debt to variable rates.  We entered into these  agreements to balance
our debt  portfolio by changing  from all fixed  interest  rates to a mixture of
fixed and floating interest rates,  thereby taking advantage of lower short-term
rates.  The notional amount of the interest rate swaps subject to variable rates
is $150.0 million. Under these agreements,  we have contracted to pay a variable
rate based upon LIBOR and to receive fixed rate  payments  ranging from 6.95% to
7.35%. We have designated the agreements as fair value hedging  instruments.  At
December 31, 2002, we recorded an asset in other  assets,  net, of $15.4 million
(its fair  value) for the swap  agreements  and  adjusted  the fair value of the
related debt by the same amount.  The effect of these agreements was a reduction
in our interest  expense of $5.1 million during 2002, when compared to the fixed
rates. At current interest rates, we expect this favorable  condition to reoccur
in 2003.

From time to time, we utilize short-term debt such as commercial paper issuances
and uncommitted  bank loans to supplement our short-term  financing  needs.  The
commercial  paper and the short-term  seasonal bank debt have a typical maturity
of 90 days or less.  The amount of commercial  paper that can be  outstanding is
limited to a maximum of the unused  portion of our $600 million bank  syndicated
revolving credit facility described in more detail below.

In the second  quarter of 2002,  we replaced  our existing  $600.0  million bank
syndicated credit facilities with new bank syndicated  credit  facilities,  also
totaling  $600.0  million.  These  facilities  are comprised of a $300.0 million
364-day  revolving  credit  facility  maturing in June 2003 and a $300.0 million
five-year  revolving  credit facility  maturing in June 2007. The terms of these
revolving  credit   facilities  are   substantially   similar  to  the  previous
facilities.  The  new  revolving  credit  facilities  will  support  any  future
commercial  paper  borrowings  and  are  otherwise  available  for  our  general
corporate  purposes.  We  anticipate  replacing  our  364 day  revolving  credit
facility  which  matures  in June 2003 with a new 364 day credit  facility  with
similar terms.  As of December 31, 2002,  there were no  outstanding  borrowings
under these credit facilities.

We use  operating  leases,  primarily  for our  retail  locations,  distribution
centers and corporate  headquarters,  to lower our capital  requirements.  Other
than these  operating  leases,  we do not have any  off-balance  sheet financing
arrangements  or  transactions,  arrangements  or  relationships  with  "special
purpose  entities." Our outstanding debt and bank syndicated  credit  facilities
have customary financial covenants.

Management  believes  that our  present  ability to borrow is  greater  than our
established  credit  lines  and  long-term  debt in  place.  However,  if market
conditions changed and sales were to be dramatically  reduced or operating costs
could  not be  controlled,  our cash  flows  and  liquidity  could  be  reduced.
Additionally,  if a scenario as  described  above  occurred,  it could cause the
rating  agencies to lower our credit ratings,  thereby  increasing our borrowing
costs,  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt
and/or equity markets.

We  repurchased  10.7 million  shares of our common stock for $275.0 million for
the year  ended  December  31,  2002,  under our  existing  25.0  million  share
repurchase program.  In connection with our share repurchase program,  our Board
of Directors  authorized us to enter into both equity  forwards and put options,
with  expiration  dates no later than  December  31,  2002,  covering  up to 4.0
million  shares of our common  stock;  consequently,  there were no  outstanding
equity forward instruments or put options at December 31, 2002.

We may continue to execute share  repurchases from time to time in order to take
advantage of attractive  share price levels,  as determined by  management.  The
timing and terms of the transactions depend on market conditions,  our liquidity
and  other  considerations.  On  February  20,  2003,  our  Board  of  Directors
authorized  a new  repurchase  program  for  15.0  million  shares,  which is in
addition to our existing 25.0 million share repurchase  program. At February 20,
2003, there were 18.6 million shares  available to be repurchased  under the two
repurchase programs. We anticipate that we will repurchase, under our authorized
repurchase  programs,  between  $200.0  million and $250.0 million of our common
stock during 2003.  This new program has no expiration date and allows shares to
be  repurchased  in the open  market.  The  funding  required  for  these  share
repurchase  programs will come from cash  generated from net sales and operating
revenues and cash and cash equivalents.  Under our programs  described above, we
will also repurchase  shares in the open market to offset the sales of shares to
our employee stock plans.

On October 10, 2002,  our Board of  Directors  approved  the  conversion  of our
RadioShack  Series B convertible  preferred stock, held by the RadioShack 401(k)
Plan, to RadioShack  common stock  effective  December 31, 2002. On December 31,
2002,  0.1  million  shares  of  this  preferred  stock,  representing  all  the
outstanding  Series B convertible  preferred stock were converted to 5.1 million
shares of our  common  stock.  The  preferred  stock was held by the  RadioShack
401(k) Plan to fund RadioShack contributions to plan participants.

In  the  fourth  quarter of  2001 and  the  second  quarter of 2002, we sold our
corporate  headquarters buildings and we are now constructing a new headquarters
in Fort Worth,  Texas.  We entered into  sale-leaseback  agreements in which our
existing corporate headquarters' land and buildings were sold and leased back to
us. These  arrangements  should  provide us with the necessary time to construct
our new  headquarters,  which we  expect to be  completed  by the end of 2004 or
early 2005. Currently, we plan to finance our new corporate  headquarters,  with
construction  costs estimated to total $200.0 million during 2003 and 2004, with
cash from operations and, if needed, existing cash and cash equivalents.

We have contingent  liabilities related to retail leases of locations which were
assigned  to other  businesses.  The  majority of these  contingent  liabilities
relate to various  lease  obligations  arising from leases that were assigned to
CompUSA,  Inc. as part of the sales of our Computer  City,  Inc.  subsidiary  to
CompUSA,  Inc. in August 1998. In the event CompUSA or the other  assignees,  as
applicable, are unable to fulfill their obligations, we would be responsible for
rent due under the leases.  Our rent exposure  from the  remaining  undiscounted
lease  commitments  with no  projected  sublease  income is  approximately  $214
million.  Moreover,  we have no  reason to  believe  that  CompUSA  or the other
assignees will not fulfill their obligations  under these leases;  consequently,
we do not believe there will be a material impact on our financial statements.

INFLATION
Inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years. We do not
expect  inflation  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  operations  in the
foreseeable future, unless world events substantially affect the global economy.

ITEM 7a.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

At December 31, 2002, we did not have any derivative instruments that materially
increased  our  exposure to market risks for interest  rates,  foreign  currency
rates,  commodity  prices or other market  price risks,  other than the interest
rate swaps noted in MD&A. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes.

Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in  short-term  interest
rates.  Interest  rate risk exists with respect to our net  investment of $248.3
million,  comprised of fluctuating  short-term investments of $398.3 million and
offset by $150.0  million of  indebtedness  which,  because of the interest rate
swaps  discussed in MD&A,  effectively  bears  interest at  short-term  floating
rates. In the future, an unfavorable  change of 100 basis points in the interest
rate applicable to this  floating-rate  net exposure could result in an increase
in annual net  interest  expense of $2.5  million.  This  assumption  assumes no
change in the net principal balance.

We also  manage  our  portfolio  of fixed rate debt to reduce  our  exposure  to
interest  rate  changes.  The fair  value of our fixed  rate  long-term  debt is
sensitive  to interest  rate  changes.  Interest  rate  changes  would result in
increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt due to differences  between
market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt  obligation.  Based
on a  hypothetical  immediate  100 basis point  increase  in  interest  rates at
December  31,  2002 and 2001,  the fair value of our fixed rate  long-term  debt
would  decrease  for  both  years  by $32.9  million,  respectively.  Based on a
hypothetical  immediate 100 basis point  decrease in interest  rates at December
31,  2002 and  2001,  the fair  value of our fixed  rate  long-term  debt  would
increase by $35.4 million and $35.6  million,  respectively.  Regarding the fair
value of our fixed rate debt,  changes in  interest  rates have no impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

                        Report of Independent Accountants



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
RadioShack Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index  on page 29  present  fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  financial
position of  RadioShack  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries  (the  "Company") at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the results of their operations and of their cash
flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  2002 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  These  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of the Company's
management;  our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the United States of
America,  which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by management and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
RadioShack Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
RadioShack Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1967. We primarily engage
in the  retail  sale of  consumer  electronic  goods and  services  through  our
RadioShack(R) store chain. Our strategy is to dominate cost-effective  solutions
to meet everyone's routine electronics needs and families' distinct  electronics
wants.  Throughout  this report,  the terms  "our," "we," "us" and  "RadioShack"
refer to RadioShack Corporation, including its subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2002, we operated 5,161 company  stores  located  throughout the
United States, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  These stores
average approximately 2,400 square feet and are located in major malls and strip
centers,  as well as  individual  storefronts.  Each  location  carries  a broad
assortment of both private label and third-party  branded products.  Our product
lines  include  electronic  parts,  batteries  and  accessories;   wireless  and
conventional  telephones;  audio and  video  equipment;  direct-to-home  ("DTH")
satellite  systems;  and personal  computers  and related  products,  as well as
specialized  products such as home air cleaners and unique toys. We also provide
consumers access to third-party  services such as cellular and PCS phone and DTH
satellite activation,  long distance telephone service, prepaid wireless airtime
and extended service plans. At December 31, 2002, we also had a network of 2,052
dealer/franchise outlets, including 58 located outside of the U.S. These outlets
provide private label and third-party  branded  products and services to smaller
communities.  The dealers are generally  engaged in other retail  operations and
augment  their  businesses  with our products and service  offerings.  Our sales
derived outside of the United States are not material.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation:  The Consolidated  Financial Statements include our
accounts and our majority  owned  subsidiaries.  Investments in 20% to 50% owned
companies are accounted for using the equity  method.  Significant  intercompany
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Pervasiveness  of  Estimates:   The  preparation  of  financial   statements  in
conformity with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires us to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities,  related  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of gain and loss
contingencies  at the date of the  financial  statements  and during the periods
presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign  Currency  Translation:  The functional  currency of  substantially  all
operations outside the U.S. is the applicable local currency.  Translation gains
or losses related to net assets located outside the United States are shown as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are classified in
the  stockholders'  equity  section  of the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance
Sheets.

Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private
label and  third-party  branded  products and services to consumers.  Revenue is
recognized,  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product  returns,  when
delivery has occurred or services have been  rendered,  the sales price is fixed
or determinable,  and  collectibility is reasonably  assured.  Certain products,
such as wireless  telephones and satellite systems,  require the customer to use
the services of a third-party  service provider.  In most cases, the third-party
service  provider will pay us a fee or commission  for obtaining a new customer,
as  well  as  a  monthly  recurring  residual  amount  based  upon  the  ongoing
arrangement  between the service  provider and the  customer.  Fee or commission
revenue,  net of estimated service  disconnects,  is generally recognized at the
time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third-party service provider.
Residual  income is  recognized  as earned under the terms of each contract with
the service  provider,  which is  typically  as the service  provider  bills its
customer.

Additionally,  our retail  operations offer repair service (i.e.,  non-warranty)
contracts on products sold. These contracts  generally  provide extended service
coverage for periods  ranging from 12 to 60 months.  We offer these contracts in
all but three states on behalf of an unrelated  third-party  obligor. We are not
considered the primary obligor on these contracts.  In these circumstances,  our
share of commission  revenue is recognized as income at the time the contract is
sold.  For the  contracts  offered in the three  states where we are the primary
obligor,  revenues from the sale of these contracts are recognized  ratably over
the terms of the contracts. Costs directly related to the sale of such contracts
are  deferred  and  charged  to cost of  products  sold  proportionately  as the
revenues are recognized.  A loss is recognized on extended service  contracts if
the sum of the expected  costs of providing  services  pursuant to the contracts
exceeds the related unearned revenue.

Advertising  Costs:  Our  advertising  costs are  expensed  the  first  time the
advertising  takes  place.  We receive  advertising  contributions  from certain
third-party  service providers and product vendors,  which we record when earned
as an offset to advertising  expense incurred to promote the applicable products
and/or services. Net advertising expense was $241.0 million,  $253.9 million and
$227.1  million  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2002,   2001  and  2000,

Stock-Based  Compensation:  At December 31, 2002,  we had  stock-based  employee
compensation  plans.  We have adopted SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," on a disclosure basis only. We measure  compensation  costs under
Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees"  and its related  interpretations.  Accordingly,  no  compensation
expense  has been  recognized  for our fixed price stock  option  plans,  as the
exercise  price of options  must be equal to or greater  than the stock price on
the date of grant under our incentive stock plans.  The table below  illustrates
the effect on net income and net income  available per common share as if we had
accounted  for our  employee  stock  options  under the fair  value  recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures below, the
estimated  fair value of the options is  amortized  to expense  over the vesting
period.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:  Long-lived assets (primarily  property,  plant
and  equipment  and  goodwill)  held  and  used by us or to be  disposed  of are
reviewed for impairment  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate
that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss
is recognized  if the sum of the expected  future cash flows  (undiscounted  and
before  interest)  from the use of the asset is less than the net book  value of
the asset.  The amount of the  impairment  loss is  measured  as the  difference
between  the net book value of the assets  and the  estimated  fair value of the
related assets.

Income  Taxes:  Income  taxes are  accounted  for using the asset and  liability
method.  Deferred taxes are recognized  for the tax  consequences  of "temporary
differences" by applying enacted  statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to  differences  between the financial  statement  carrying  amounts and the tax
basis of existing  assets and  liabilities.  The effect on  deferred  taxes of a
change in tax rates is  recognized  in income in the period  that  includes  the
enactment date. In addition, we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that
such benefits are more likely than not to be realized.

Earnings  Per Share:  Basic  earnings  per share is  computed  based only on the
weighted average number of common shares  outstanding for each period presented.
Diluted  earnings per share  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that would have
occurred if securities or other  contracts to issue common stock were exercised,
converted,  or  resulted in the  issuance  of common  stock that would have then
shared in the  earnings  of the  entity.  The  following  table  reconciles  the
numerator  and  denominator  used in the basic and  diluted  earnings  per share
calculations.

Options to purchase 18.1 million,  12.2 million and 0.9 million shares of common
stock in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, were not included in the computation
of diluted  earnings  per common  share  because the option  exercise  price was
greater than the average market price of the common stock during the year.

Cash and Cash  Equivalents:  Cash on hand in stores,  deposits  in banks and all
highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months
or less at the time of purchase are considered cash and cash  equivalents.  Cash
equivalents are carried at cost,  which  approximates  fair value because of the
short maturity of the instruments. The weighted average interest rates were 1.3%
and 1.7% at  December  31,  2002 and 2001,  respectively,  for cash  equivalents
totaling $398.3 million and $322.1 million, respectively.

Accounts  Receivable  and Allowance  For Doubtful  Accounts:  Concentrations  of
credit risk with  respect to customer  receivables  are limited due to the large
number of  customers  comprising  our customer  base and their  location in many
different   geographic  areas  of  the  country.   However,   we  do  have  some
concentration  of credit risk from service  providers in the wireless  telephone
and DTH  satellite  services  industries,  due to sales of  their  products  and
services.  We maintain an allowance  for doubtful  accounts  where  accounts are
determined to be uncollectible and, historically, such losses, in the aggregate,
have not exceeded our expectations.

Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally  based on
average cost) or market value and are comprised primarily of finished goods.

Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost,
less  accumulated   depreciation  and  amortization.   For  financial  reporting
purposes,  depreciation  and  amortization  are primarily  calculated  using the
straight-line  method,  which  amortizes  the  cost  of the  assets  over  their
estimated useful lives. When depreciable assets are sold or retired, the related
cost and  accumulated  depreciation  are removed from the accounts and gains and
losses  are  recognized.   Major  additions  and  betterments  are  capitalized.
Maintenance  and repairs which do not materially  improve or extend the lives of
the   respective   assets  are  charged  to  operating   expenses  as  incurred.
Amortization of buildings  under capital leases is included in depreciation  and
amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Capitalized Software Costs: We capitalize qualifying costs related to developing
internal-use  software.  Capitalization  of costs  begins  after the  conceptual
formulation  stage has been completed.  Capitalized costs are amortized over the
estimated  useful life of the  software,  which  ranges  between  three and five
years.  Capitalized  software costs at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, totaled
$43.8 million, $46.6 million and $39.6 million, net of accumulated  amortization
of $39.0 million, $26.3 million and $16.0 million, respectively.

Goodwill:  Goodwill,  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of net assets  acquired.  At  December  31,  2001,  the net  goodwill
balance totaled $11.0 million, composed primarily of goodwill resulting from the
1999 acquisition of AmeriLink Corporation, also known as RadioShack Installation
Services  ("RSIS").  During 2002, we recorded an impairment of the RSIS goodwill
aggregating  $8.1 million,  resulting in a net goodwill  balance at December 31,
2002, of $2.9 million (see Note 6 for further details).

Derivatives:  During the third quarter of 2001, we entered into several interest
rate swap agreements,  with maturities  ranging from 2004 to 2007, to manage our
exposure to interest rate movements by  effectively  converting a portion of our
long-term debt from fixed to variable  rates.  The accounting for changes in the
fair  value of an  interest  rate swap  depends  on the use of the swap.  To the
extent  that a swap is  effective  as a cash flow hedge of an exposure to future
changes  in cash  flows,  the change in fair  value of the swap is  deferred  in
accumulated  other  comprehensive  income.  To the extent that a  derivative  is
effective as a hedge of an exposure to future changes in fair value,  the change
in the derivative's fair value is recorded in earnings, as is the change in fair
value of the item being hedged. Any portion considered to be ineffective will be
immediately reported in earnings. The differentials to be received or paid under
interest rate swap contracts  designated as hedges are recognized in income over
the life of the contracts as adjustments to interest  expense.  Gains and losses
on terminations of interest rate contracts designated as hedges are deferred and
amortized  into  interest  expense  over  the  remaining  life  of the  original
contracts or until repayment of the hedged indebtedness.

We maintain strict internal controls,  which include policies and procedures for
risk  assessment  and the approval,  reporting and  monitoring of all derivative
financial  instrument  activities.  We monitor our hedging  positions and credit
worthiness  of  our  counter-parties  and do not  anticipate  losses  due to our
counter-parties'  nonperformance.  We do not hold or issue derivative  financial
instruments  for  trading  or  speculative   purposes.   To  qualify  for  hedge
accounting,   derivatives  must  meet  defined   correlation  and  effectiveness
criteria,  be  designated  as a hedge  and  result in cash  flows and  financial
statement effects that substantially offset those of the position being hedged.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  The fair value of financial instruments is
determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques as
appropriate.   Unless  otherwise   disclosed,   the  fair  values  of  financial
instruments  approximate their recorded values,  due primarily to the short-term
nature of their maturities or their varying interest rates.

Comprehensive  Income (Loss):  Comprehensive  income is defined as the change in
equity (net assets) of a business  enterprise during a period,  except for those
changes  resulting  from  investments  by owners  and  distributions  to owners.
Comprehensive  income (loss) is comprised of the gain (loss) on an interest rate
swap used as a cash flow hedge and  foreign  currency  translation  adjustments,
which  are  shown  net of tax in the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statements  of
Stockholders' Equity.

Reclassifications:  Certain amounts in the December 31, 2001 and 2000, financial
statements  have been  reclassified  to  conform  with the  December  31,  2002,
presentation.   These   reclassifications   had  no  effect  on  net  income  or
stockholders' equity as previously reported.

Recently  Issued  Accounting  Pronouncements:  In  August  2001,  the  Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB") issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which
is  effective  for fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,  2002.  SFAS No. 143
establishes   financial  accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible  long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003. We do
not believe the standard will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial statements.

On June 28, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal  Activities."  SFAS No. 146 addresses  significant  issues
relating to the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs associated with
exit and disposal activities,  including restructuring activities, and nullifies
the guidance in Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3,  "Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)."  The provisions
of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal  activities  initiated  after
December 31, 2002.  Retroactive  application of SFAS No. 146 is prohibited  and,
accordingly, liabilities recognized prior to the initial application of SFAS No.
146 should  continue to be accounted for in  accordance  with EITF 94-3 or other
applicable  preexisting  guidance.  We adopted SFAS No. 146 effective January 1,
2003. We do not believe the standard will have a material  adverse effect on our
consolidated financial statements.

In December  2002,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and  Disclosure."  This Statement amends SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,"  to provide  alternative  methods of
transition  for a voluntary  change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee  compensation.  In addition,  this Statement amends the
disclosure  requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent  disclosures about
the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of
the method used on reported results.  We adopted the disclosure  requirements of
SFAS No. 148 effective December 31, 2002, and we made no material adjustments as
a result of this adoption.

In December 2002, the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. ("FIN") 45,  "Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements for Guarantees,  Including Guarantees of
Indebtedness  of Others." FIN 45 is effective for guarantees  issued or modified
after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements were effective for the year
ended  December 31,  2002,  and expand the  disclosures  required by a guarantor
about its obligations under a guarantee. FIN 45 also requires that we recognize,
guarantees entered into or modified after December 31, 2002, as a  liability for
the fair value of the  obligation  undertaken in the issuance of the  guarantee.
FIN 45 became  effective  January 1, 2003. We do not believe the  interpretation
will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2003,  the FASB issued FIN 46,  "Consolidation  of Variable  Interest
Entities - an Interpretation  of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 addresses  consolidation by
business   enterprises   of  variable   interest   entities  that  have  certain
characteristics.   The  consolidation   requirement  of  FIN  46  is  applicable
immediately to variable  interest entities created or obtained after January 31,
2003.  For variable  interest  entities  acquired  before  February 1, 2003, the
consolidation  requirement  of FIN 46 is applicable to us as of July 1, 2003. We
believe  the  adoption  of  FIN  46  will  not  have a  material  impact  on our
consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002,  the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 02-16,  "Accounting
for Consideration  Received from a Vendor by a Customer (Including a Reseller of
the Vendor's  Products)." EITF 02-16 provides guidance on how cash consideration
received by a customer  from a vendor  should be  classified  in the  customer's
statement of income.  EITF 02-16 is effective prospectively for new arrangements
entered into after  December 31, 2002 and income  statements  for prior  periods
presented should be reclassified to comply with its consensus.  We are analyzing
the  provisions  of EITF 02-16 as they relate to our  accounting  policies.  The
impact,  if any, of  compliance  with the  consensus  on EITF 02-16 has not been
determined at this time.

In the fourth  quarter of 2001,  we sold and leased  back most of our  corporate
headquarters  and recognized a loss of $44.8 million.  The operating lease has a
three-year term expiring in 2004 with renewal options.  In the second quarter of
2002,  we sold  and  leased  back  our  corporate  technology  center  building,
recording this  transaction as a financing  obligation  because we have retained
certain  responsibilities  during the lease term.  Under a financing  lease, the
assets remain on our balance sheet. This lease has a three-year term expiring in
2005 with renewal options. The lessors are unrelated  third-parties.  We entered
into these  transactions in contemplation of and to facilitate the relocation of
our corporate  headquarters to a new custom-built  corporate  campus,  currently
being  constructed  and  scheduled  for  occupation  by the  end of  2004 or the
beginning of 2005.

NOTE 6 - IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
RSIS  was  acquired  in  1999  to  provide  us  with  residential   installation
capabilities  for the  technologies  and services  offered in our retail stores.
Since its  acquisition,  RSIS has incurred  operating  losses and negative  cash
flows. In 2000 and in 2001, we attempted to restructure and reorganize RSIS, but
due  to  the  overall  slowdown  in the  economy  and  the  market  decline  for
professionally  installed home Internet connectivity services, RSIS continued to
report losses. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we prepared a revised analysis
of estimated  future cash flows for RSIS,  which  indicated  that its long-lived
assets  were  impaired.   The  carrying  value  of  RSIS's   long-lived   assets
(principally goodwill and fixed assets) exceeded the discounted present value of
the estimated future cash flows by approximately $37.0 million. An impairment of
goodwill  for  that  amount  was  recorded  and  included  in  the  accompanying
Consolidated Statement of Income for 2001. As a result of continued difficulties
in the DTH business  and a refocus  during the fourth  quarter on our  satellite
installation  strategy,  together  with a revised cash flow  projection  for our
overall  installation  business,  we determined  that the  remaining  long-lived
assets  associated  with RSIS were  impaired.  We compared the carrying value of
these long-lived  assets with their fair value and determined that the remaining
goodwill  balance of $8.1 million was impaired  and we,  therefore,  recorded an
impairment charge of this amount in the accompanying 2002 Consolidated Statement
of Income.  As of December 31, 2002, there was no remaining  goodwill balance on
our balance sheet relating to RSIS.

Our   test    concept    with    Blockbuster    to    introduce   a   RadioShack
"store-within-a-store"  at Blockbuster locations did not provide sufficient cash
flows to  recover  our  investment  in  fixtures  and  other  fixed  assets.  An
impairment  loss of $2.8  million was  recorded  for those assets in 2001 and is
included as a component of impairment of long-lived  assets in the  accompanying
2001 Consolidated Statement of Income.

The fair value of our  long-term  debt of $611.3  million and $647.8  million at
December  31,  2002 and 2001,  respectively,  (including  current  portion,  but
excluding  2001  capital  leases) was  approximately  $627.3  million and $666.0
million,  respectively. The fair values were computed using interest rates which
were in effect at the balance sheet dates for similar debt instruments.

On May 11, 2001, we issued  $350.0  million of 10-year 7 3/8% notes in a private
offering to initial purchasers who offered the notes to qualified  institutional
buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual  interest rate on the notes is 7.375% per
annum with interest  payable on November 15 and May 15 of each year.  Payment of
interest on the notes  commenced on November  15, 2001,  and the notes mature on
May 15, 2011. In August 2001, under the terms of an exchange offering filed with
the SEC, we exchanged  substantially  all of these notes for a similar amount of
publicly  registered  notes.  As no  additional  debt was issued in the exchange
offering, the net effect of this exchange was that no additional debt was issued
on August 3, 2001, and  substantially  all of the notes are now registered  with
the SEC.

We  had  a  $300.0  million  Debt  Shelf  Registration  Statement  ("1997  Shelf
Registration")  which became  effective in August 1997. Our medium and long-term
notes  outstanding  at  December  31,  2002,  under the 1997 Shelf  Registration
totaled $214.5  million.  The interest rate for the  outstanding  $150.0 million
10-year  unsecured  long-term  notes is 6.95%.  These notes are due September 1,
2007. The interest rates at December 31, 2002, for the outstanding $64.5 million
medium-term notes ranged from 6.13% to 7.35% with a weighted average coupon rate
of 6.86%.  These medium-term notes have maturities ranging from 2003 to 2008. As
of December 31, 2002, there was no remaining  availability under this 1997 Shelf
Registration.

During the third  quarter of 2001,  we entered into several  interest  rate swap
agreements, with maturities ranging from 2004 to 2007, to manage our exposure to
interest  rate  movements by  effectively  converting a portion of our long-term
debt from fixed to variable  rates.  The notional  amount of the  interest  rate
swaps subject to variable rates is $150.0 million.  Under these  agreements,  we
have  contracted  to pay a variable  rate based upon LIBOR and to receive  fixed
rate payments  ranging from 6.95% to 7.35%. We have designated the agreements as
fair value hedging  instruments.  We recorded an asset in other assets,  net, of
$15.4 million and $2.9 million (their fair value) at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, for the swap agreements and adjusted the fair value of the related
debt by the same amount. Fair value was computed using interest rates which were
in  effect  as  of  December  31,  2002  and  2001,  respectively,  for  similar
instruments.

time period such debt was outstanding,  as well as the amount  outstanding.  Our
financing,  primarily short-term debt, consists of short-term seasonal bank debt
and commercial paper. The commercial paper and the short-term seasonal bank debt
have a typical  maturity of 90 days or less. The amount of commercial paper that
can be  outstanding  is limited  to a maximum of the unused  portion of our $600
million  bank  syndicated  revolving  credit  facility  described in more detail
below.

In the second  quarter of 2002,  we replaced  our existing  $600.0  million bank
syndicated credit facilities with new bank syndicated  credit  facilities,  also
totaling  $600.0  million.  These  facilities  are comprised of a $300.0 million
364-day  revolving  credit  facility  maturing in June 2003 and a $300.0 million
five-year  revolving  credit facility  maturing in June 2007. The terms of these
revolving  credit   facilities  are   substantially   similar  to  the  previous
facilities.  The  new  revolving  credit  facilities  will  support  any  future
commercial  paper  borrowings  and  are  otherwise  available  for  our  general
corporate  purposes.  Annual commitment fees for the facilities are 0.08% of the
$300.0  million  364-day  facility  and 0.10% of the  $300.0  million  multiyear
facility, whether used or unused.

We  established  an  employee  stock  ownership  trust  in  June  1990.  Further
information on the trust and its related indebtedness,  which we guaranteed,  is
detailed in the discussion of the RadioShack 401(k) Plan in Note 21.

NOTE 9 - BUSINESS RESTRUCTURINGS
In 1996 and 1997, we initiated certain restructuring  programs in which a number
of our former McDuff,  Computer City and Incredible  Universe retail stores were
closed. We still have certain real estate  obligations  related to some of these
closed stores. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, this accrual totaled
$16.3 million and $11.8  million,  consisting of the  remaining  estimated  real
estate obligations to be paid. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, additional provisions
of $7.2 million, $3.0 million and $0.8 million were recorded.  The 2002 increase
of $7.2 million for real estate obligations  consisted primarily of $6.0 million
due  to the  bankruptcy  of  the  sub-lessee  in a  former  Incredible  Universe
location.  Additionally,  costs of $2.7  million,  $2.2 million and $4.3 million
were charged to this liability in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The balance
in the  restructuring  reserve at December  31, 2002,  included  $9.0 million in
accrued  expenses  and $7.3  million  in other  non-current  liabilities  in the
accompanying  2002  Consolidated  Balance Sheet.  These  reserves  represent the
revised  expected  loss  on  the  eventual  disposition  of  these  real  estate
obligations  and are  based on  current  comparable  rates  for  leases in their
respective  markets.  If facilities  rental rates  continue to decrease in these
markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease  these  facilities,  the
actual  loss could  exceed  this  reserve  estimate.  Costs will  continue to be
incurred  over the remaining  terms of these leases,  the longest of which is 17
years.

In  2001,  we  recorded  a total  of  $25.9  million  in  restructuring  charges
consisting of $13.5 million  principally  related to a general  reduction of our
corporate  management  and  administrative  labor force and  primarily for early
retirement and involuntary  and voluntary  employee  severance  during the third
quarter  of 2001,  $4.8  million  for the  closure  of our  national  commercial
installation  business in the fourth  quarter of 2001,  and $7.6 million for the
closure of 35  underperforming  stores  during the fourth  quarter of 2001.  The
expense  for the  reduction  in labor  force  in the  third  quarter  of 2001 is
included  in  employee  separation  and  other  costs in our  2001  Consolidated
Statement  of Income.  These 2001  charges  included  $8.8  million in severance
payments to the affected employees; $7.2 million in other employee related costs
such as  outplacement  services,  acceleration  of vesting of outstanding  stock
option grants and  contractual  salary  continuation  payments;  $6.0 million in
write-downs of store fixtures and leasehold  improvements  and the fleet of RSIS
vehicles;  and $3.9 million in future lease  commitment  obligations,  net of an
assumption for future  sublease  rental income or lessor  buyouts.  Of the $25.9
million expensed in 2001, we made cash payments of $6.9 million, principally for
severance  costs,  and wrote off $5.2 million of fixed  assets  related to store
fixtures and leasehold  improvements.  For the year ended  December 31, 2002, we
made an additional  $3.5 million in cash payments for severance  costs and lease
commitments  and buyouts.  During this period we also reversed  reserves of $2.9
million  that  were  determined  to no  longer  be  required  and  wrote off the
remaining  $0.8 million  fixed asset balance  associated  with the fleet of RSIS
vehicles.  The  remaining  balance  of the 2001  restructuring  reserve  of $6.6
million represents $2.8 million of salary continuation  payments over the next 9
years, $1.2 million from the acceleration of vesting of stock option grants, and
$2.6 million of future lease commitment obligations. As of December 31, 2002, we
considered  these  restructuring  activities  to be  substantially  complete and
transferred  the  remaining  restructuring  reserve  of $3.8  million to accrued
expenses and $2.8 million to other  non-current  liabilities in the accompanying
2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 10 - LOSS ON SALE OF ASSETS
On August  31,  1998,  we  completed  the sale of our wholly  owned  subsidiary,
Computer  City,  Inc., to CompUSA Inc. for cash and an unsecured  note of $136.0
million.   On  June  22,  2001,  we  received   $123.6  million  for  the  final
determination  of the purchase  price and settlement of the $136.0 million note,
resulting in an additional loss of $12.4 million from the sale of Computer City,
Inc.  This  loss  was  recorded  in 2001  and is  included  in the  accompanying
Consolidated Statement of Income as a loss on sale of assets.

NOTE 11 - GAIN ON CONTRACT TERMINATION
RadioShack  and  Microsoft  mutually  agreed  during  2002  to  terminate  their
agreement  and settle the  remaining  commitments  each had to one another.  The
termination  of this agreement took effect at the start of the fourth quarter of
2002, upon satisfaction of several  contractual  obligations.  The net financial
result was an $18.5 million gain (principally  cash received),  driven primarily
by the settlement of a multi-year obligation Microsoft had to connect our stores
with broadband capabilities.

NOTE 12 - PROVISION FOR LOSS ON INTERNET-RELATED INVESTMENT
During the second  quarter of 2000, we made a $30.0  million cash  investment in
Digital:Convergence  Corporation  ("DC"), a privately-held  Internet  technology
company.  In the first  quarter of 2001,  we believed  that our  investment  had
experienced a decline in value that, in our opinion,  was other than  temporary.
This belief was due to DC's inability to secure  financing at that time, as well
as its  commencement of  restructuring  activities  involving the termination of
much of its workforce and the curtailing of its business activities. As such, we
recorded a loss provision equal to our initial investment. DC subsequently filed
for bankruptcy on March 22, 2002.

We  anticipate  that we  will generate  enough  pre-tax income in  the future to
realize  the  full  benefit  of U.S.  deferred  tax  assets  related  to  future
deductible  amounts.  Accordingly,  a valuation  allowance  was not  required at
December  31,  2002 or 2001.  All of our  federal  income tax returns are closed
through June 1989. The Internal Revenue Service is concluding its examination of
federal  income tax returns for 1990 through  1997,  and is currently  examining
federal  income tax returns for 1998 through 2001. In addition,  we have various
state income tax returns in the process of examination.

NOTE 14 - MINORITY INTEREST IN SUBSIDIARY
In November 1999, we formed a limited liability company, RadioShack.com LLC, and
in January 2000 Microsoft Corporation contributed $100.0 million for 100% of the
preferred  units  in  this  company.  On  July  6,  2001,  we  purchased  all of
Microsoft's  preferred units in  RadioShack.com  LLC for $88.0 million,  thereby
eliminating the minority interest in  RadioShack.com  LLC. The difference in the
initial  price of the  preferred  units  and  repurchase  price was  treated  as
redemption of  mandatorily  redeemable  preferred  units,  which  resulted in an
increase to additional paid-in capital.

NOTE 15 - LITIGATION
In October 2002, the court approved the final settlement,  tentatively agreed to
in June 2002, of $29.9  million in a class action  lawsuit  originally  filed in
March  2000 in Orange  County,  California.  Actual  payments  for this  lawsuit
totaled  $29.0  million.  The  lawsuit,  styled Omar  Belazi,  et al. vs.  Tandy
Corporation, et al., related to the alleged miscalculation of overtime wages for
certain of our former and current employees in that state.

In the second quarter of 2002, we received payments and recorded income of $27.7
million  in  partial  settlement  of  amounts  owed to us  under  a tax  sharing
agreement  that was the subject of an arbitration  which  commenced in July 1999
and was styled Tandy  Corporation  and T.E.  Electronics,  L.P.  vs.  O'Sullivan
Industries  Holdings,  Inc  ("O'Sullivan").   The  arbitration  ruling  requires
O'Sullivan to comply with the tax sharing agreement that was entered into by the
parties at the time of O'Sullivan's initial public offering.

During the second half of 2002,  we received two payments  totaling $6.2 million
relating to quarterly  payments under the tax sharing agreement with O'Sullivan.
Future payments will vary based on the level of O'Sullivan's future earnings. In
the near term,  we expect that the  quarterly  payments  to us will  approximate
those received to date; however,  these payments are dependent upon O'Sullivan's
overall financial  condition and ability to pay.  Consequently,  there can be no
assurances  that we will receive timely each payment that may be due to us under
the tax sharing agreement.

We have various other pending  claims,  lawsuits,  disputes with third  parties,
investigations  and actions incident to the operation of our business.  Although
occasional  adverse  settlements or resolutions may occur and negatively  impact
earnings  in the year of  settlement,  it is our  opinion  that  their  ultimate
resolution will not have a materially adverse effect on our financial  condition
or liquidity.

NOTE 16 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Lease Commitments:  We lease rather than own most of our facilities.  Our retail
stores comprise the largest portion of our leased  facilities.  These stores are
located  primarily in major shopping  malls and shopping  centers owned by other
companies.  Some leases are based on a minimum  rental plus a percentage  of the
store's sales in excess of a stipulated base figure. We also lease  distribution
centers and office space.

Contingent Liabilities:  We have contingent liabilities related to retail leases
of  locations  which  were  assigned  to  other  businesses.   The  majority  of
these contingent  liabilities  relate to various lease obligations  arising from
leases that were assigned to CompUSA,  Inc. as part of the sales of our Computer
City, Inc.  subsidiary to CompUSA,  Inc. in August 1998. In the event CompUSA or
the other assignees, as applicable, are unable to fulfill their obligations,  we
would be  responsible  for rent due under the leases.  Our rent  exposure of the
remaining  undiscounted  lease commitments with no projected  sublease income is
approximately  $214  million.  We have no reason to believe  that CompUSA or the
other  assignees  will  not  fulfill  their   obligations  under  these  leases;
consequently, we do not believe there will be a material impact on our financial
statements.

NOTE 17 - STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS
We   have implemented several plans to award employees stock-based compensation.
Under the Incentive  Stock Plans ("ISPs")  described  below,  the exercise price
of options must be equal to or greater than the fair market value on the date of
grant.  The  1997,  1999  and  2001  ISPs  each  terminate  after  10 years;  no
option  or  award  may be  granted  under  the  ISPs  after  the ISP termination
date.  The  Management  Development and  Compensation  Committee  (formerly  the
Organization  and  Compensation   Committee)  (the  "Committee")  specifies  the
terms for  grants of options  under  these  ISPs;  terms  of  these  options may
not exceed 10  years.  Grants of options  generally  vest over three  years  and
grants  typically  have a  term of seven or ten years.  Option agreements issued
under  the ISPs  generally  provide  that, in the event of a change in  control,
all options become  immediately  and fully exercisable.  Repricing or exchanging
options for  lower  priced  options is  not  permitted  under  the  ISPs without
shareholder approval.

The 1997,  1999 and 2001 ISPs  specify that each of our  non-employee  directors
will  receive a grant of  non-qualified  stock  options  (options  which are not
incentive  stock  options)  ("NQs") for 16,000 shares of our common stock on the
first  business  day of  September  each  year  ("Director  Options").  However,
Director  Option  grants  are not made under more than one ISP in the same year.
New directors,  upon election or  appointment,  will receive a one-time grant of
20,000 shares at the time they attend their first Board  meeting,  and these new
directors  will not receive  the annual  Director  Option  grant until they have
served at least one year.  Director  Options under the 1997 ISP have an exercise
price of 100% of the fair  market  value of our common  stock on the trading day
prior to the date of grant.  Director  Options under the 1999 and 2001 ISPs have
an  exercise  price of 100% of the fair  market  value of a share of our  common
stock on the date of grant.  If a grant is made under the 1999 or 2001 ISPs on a
non-trading  date, the closest  previous trading date is used. Under these ISPs,
one-third of the Director  Options vest annually on the first three  anniversary
dates of the date of grant and options expire ten years after the date of grant.

A brief description of each our stock plans follows:

     1993 Incentive Stock Plan ("1993 ISP"): The 1993 ISP permitted the grant of
     up to 12.0 million shares in the form of incentive stock options ("ISOs"),
     NQs and restricted stock. There were no shares available on December 31,
     2002, for grants under the 1993 ISP. The 1993 ISP terminates on March 28,
     2003, and no further grants may be made under this plan.

     1994 Stock Incentive Plan ("1994 SIP"): As part of the purchase of
     AmeriLink (see Note 6), we agreed to assume the existing AmeriLink
     Corporation 1994 Stock Incentive Plan and certain related agreements and to
     convert AmeriLink's stock options to stock options to purchase our stock,
     subject to an agreed upon exchange ratio and conversion price. Thus, the
     AmeriLink 1994 SIP was assumed and adopted by us in 1999. All options in
     the 1994 SIP were fully vested on the date of transition and management has
     determined that no further grants will be made under this plan. There were
     certain restricted stock agreements that were also assumed by us at the
     time of acquisition.

     1997 Incentive Stock Plan ("1997 ISP"): The 1997 ISP permits the grant of
     up to 11.0 million shares in the form of ISOs, NQs and restricted stock.
     The 1997 ISP provides that the maximum number of shares of our common stock
     that an eligible employee may receive in any calendar year with respect to
     options may not exceed 1.0 million shares. There were 107,647 shares
     available on December 31, 2002, for grants under the 1997 ISP.

     1999 Incentive Stock Plan ("1999 ISP"): The 1999 ISP permits the grant of
     up to 9.5 million shares in the form of NQs to broad based employee groups,
     primarily our 5,000 plus store managers and to other eligible employees and
     non-employee directors. Grants of restricted stock, performance awards and
     options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal
     Revenue Code are not authorized under the 1999 ISP. The 1999 ISP provides
     that the maximum number of shares of our common stock that an eligible
     employee may receive in any calendar year with respect to options may not
     exceed 1.0 million shares. There were 401,680 shares available on December
     31, 2002, for grants under the 1999 ISP.

     2001 Incentive Stock Plan ("2001 ISP"): The 2001 ISP permits the grant of
     up to 9.2 million shares in the form of ISOs and NQs. The 2001 ISP provides
     that the maximum number of shares of our common stock that an eligible
     employee may receive in any calendar year with respect to options may not
     exceed 0.5 million shares. There were 7,544,766 shares available on
     December 31, 2002, for grants under the 2001 ISP.

Restricted Stock: We may also use restricted stock grants to compensate  certain
of our  employees.  As of December 31, 2002,  18,369 shares of restricted  stock
were  outstanding,  but  not  fully  vested.  Compensation  expense  related  to
restricted  shares is recognized over the related  service period.  This expense
totaled $0.7 million and $1.2 million for the years ended  December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. There was no expense for the year ended December 31, 2002.

In 1997,  the Committee  granted a total of 56,000  shares of  restricted  stock
awards to three executive officers. These awards vested ratably over three years
and were fully vested in 2000. In 1998, the Committee granted a total of 172,000
shares of restricted stock awards to three executive officers.  Of these awards,
100,000  shares  vested  ratably over three years and were fully vested in 2001.
The  remaining  72,000 shares  vested in 1999.  In 1999,  the Committee  granted
10,000 shares of restricted stock awards to two executive officers. These awards
were to vest ratably over three  years;  4,000 of these awards were  canceled in
2000. At December 31, 2001,  all of the 1999 shares granted had either vested or
been  canceled.  In 2000,  the  Committee  granted a total of  66,712  shares of
restricted  stock awards to 38 executive  officers and these awards vest ratably
over three years, subject to the achievement of certain performance targets each
year.  At  December  31,  2002,  18,369 of the shares  granted in 2000  remained
outstanding. No restricted awards were granted in 2001 or 2002.

NOTE 18 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
The Executive  Deferred  Compensation Plan and the Executive Deferred Stock Plan
("Compensation  Plans")  became  effective on April 1, 1998.  These plans permit
employees  who are  corporate  or division  officers to defer up to 80% of their
base salary and/or bonuses.  Certain executive  officers may defer up to 100% of
their base salary and/or bonuses.  In addition,  officers are permitted to defer
delivery of any  restricted  stock or stock  acquired  under an NQ exercise that
would  otherwise  vest. Cash deferrals may be made in our common stock or mutual
funds;  however,  restricted  stock and stock  acquired under an NQ exercise may
only be made in our common stock.  We match 12% of salary and bonus deferrals in
the form of our  common  stock.  We will match an  additional  25% of salary and
bonus  deferrals if the deferral period exceeds five years and the deferrals are
invested in our common stock.  Payment of deferrals will be made in cash and our
common stock in accordance with the employee's specifications at the time of the
deferral;  payments  to  the  employee  will  be in a  lump  sum  or  in  annual
installments not to exceed 20 years.

We contributed  $0.5 million,  $1.4 million and $1.3 million to the Compensation
Plans for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 19 - TERMINATION PROTECTION PLANS
In August  1990 and in May 1995,  our Board of  Directors  approved  termination
protection   plans  and  amendments  to  the   termination   protection   plans,
respectively. These plans provide for defined termination benefits to be paid to
our eligible  employees who have been  terminated,  without  cause,  following a
change in control of our  company.  In  addition,  for a certain  period of time
following  an  employee's  termination,  we, at our  expense,  must  continue to
provide on behalf of the terminated  employee certain  employment  benefits.  In
general,  during the twelve  months  following a change in  control,  we may not
terminate  or change  existing  employee  benefit  plans in any way which  would
affect accrued  benefits or decrease the rate of our  contribution to the plans.
There have been no payments under these protection plans for the years shown.

NOTE 20 - COMPANY STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
Eligible  employees  may  contribute  1% to 7% of their annual  compensation  to
purchase our common stock at the monthly  average daily closing price.  We match
40%, 60% or 80% of the  employee's  contribution,  depending  on the  employee's
length of continuous  participation  in the Stock Purchase  Plan.  This match is
also in the form of our common stock.  Company  contributions  to the Stock Plan
amounted to $15.1  million,  $15.4 million and $16.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE 21 - RADIOSHACK 401(k) PLAN
The  RadioShack  401(k) Plan  ("Plan"),  formerly  the Tandy Fund,  is a defined
contribution  plan.  Eligible  employees  may direct  their  contributions  into
various   investment   options,   including   investing  in  our  common  stock.
Participants  may  defer,  via  payroll  deductions,  1% to 8% of  their  annual
compensation.  Contributions  per  participant  are  limited to  certain  annual
maximums  permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. Any Company  contributions are
made directly to the Plan and are invested in our common stock.  Effective April
1, 2002,  participants  become fully vested in the  contributions we make to the
Plan upon completion of three years of service with us.

TESOP  Portion of the Plan:  On July 31, 1990,  the trustee of the Plan borrowed
$100.0  million at an interest  rate of 9.34%;  this amount was paid off on June
30, 2000 ("TESOP  Notes").  The Plan  trustee  used the  proceeds  from the 1990
issuance  of the  TESOP  Notes  to  purchase  from us  100,000  shares  of TESOP
Preferred  Stock at a price of $1,000  per share.  In  December  1994,  the Plan
entered into an agreement with an unrelated third-party to refinance up to $16.7
million  of the TESOP  Notes in a series of six annual  notes  (the  "Refinanced
Notes"),  beginning  December  30, 1994.  As of December 31, 1999,  the Plan had
borrowed all of the $16.7 million for the  refinancing of the TESOP Notes. As of
December 31, 2002,  the Plan had repaid all of the  Refinanced  Notes.  Dividend
payments and  contributions  received by the Plan from us were used to repay the
indebtedness.

Each share of TESOP Preferred  Stock was  convertible  into 87.072 shares of our
common stock. The annual cumulative dividend on TESOP Preferred Stock was $75.00
per share, payable semiannually.  Because we had guaranteed the repayment of the
Refinanced  Notes, the indebtedness of the Plan was recognized as a liability in
the accompanying  Consolidated  Balance Sheets. An offsetting charge was made in
the stockholders'  equity section of the accompanying 2001 Consolidated  Balance
Sheet to reflect unearned deferred compensation related to the Plan. On December
31, 2002,  all shares of TESOP  Preferred  Stock were  converted into our common
stock and all deferred  compensation  related to the Plan was  recognized  as of
that date.

Compensation  and interest  expense related to the Plan before the reduction for
the allocation of dividends are presented below for each year ended December 31:

(In millions)           2002      2001     2000
- -------------           ----      ----     ----
Compensation expense  $  4.3    $  6.4   $  7.8
Accrued additional
 contribution            4.1       --       --
Interest expense         0.2       0.8      1.4

Until the Plan  year  ending  March 31,  2003,  the  TESOP  Preferred  Stock was
allocated to the participants annually,  based on the total debt service made on
the indebtedness.  As shares of the TESOP Preferred Stock were allocated to Plan
participants,   compensation   expense  was  recorded   and  unearned   deferred
compensation  was reduced.  Interest  expense on the  Refinanced  Notes was also
recognized as a cost of the Plan. The compensation component of the Plan expense
was reduced by the amount of  dividends  accrued on the TESOP  Preferred  Stock,
with  any  dividends  in  excess  of the  compensation  expense  reflected  as a
reduction of interest expense.

Contributions made by us to the Plan for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, totaled $4.0  million,  $8.6 million and $10.9  million, respectively,
including  dividends  paid on the TESOP  Preferred  Stock of $4.5 million,  $4.9
million and $5.3 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2002, all of the original  100,000 shares of TESOP  Preferred
Stock were  converted  into 5.1 million shares of our common stock and allocated
to participants' accounts in the Plan.

NOTE 22 - TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On December 14, 2000, we announced  that our Board of Directors  had  authorized
management  to  purchase  up  to  10.0  million  shares  of  our  common  stock.
Additionally, on December 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had
expanded  that  existing  program to authorize us to purchase up to 25.0 million
shares of our common stock. The expanded program has no expiration date.  During
2002, 10.7 million shares were repurchased for $275.0 million.  Subsequently, on
February 20, 2003, the Board of Directors  approved a new repurchase  program of
15.0 million  shares.  This new program has no expiration date and allows shares
to be  repurchased  in the open market.  At February  20, 2003,  there were 18.6
million shares available for repurchase under the two programs.

The purchases under the share repurchase program described above are in addition
to the shares  required for employee stock purchase  plans,  which are purchased
from our treasury throughout the year.

NOTE 23 - PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
In July 1999, the Board of Directors  amended and restated a stockholder  rights
plan which  declared a dividend of one right for each  outstanding  share of our
common stock. The rights plan, as amended and restated,  will expire on July 26,
2009.  The rights are currently  represented  by our common stock  certificates.
When the rights  become  exercisable,  they will entitle each holder to purchase
1/10,000th of a share of our Series A Junior  Participating  Preferred Stock for
an  exercise  price of $250  (subject  to  adjustment).  The rights  will become
exercisable  and will trade  separately from the common stock only upon the date
of public  announcement  that a person,  entity or group ("Person") has acquired
15% or more of our  outstanding  common stock without the consent or approval of
the  disinterested   directors  ("Acquiring  Person")  or  ten  days  after  the
commencement  or public  announcement  of a tender or exchange offer which would
result in any Person becoming an Acquiring  Person. In the event that any Person
becomes  an  Acquiring  Person,  the  rights  will  be  exercisable  for 60 days
thereafter  for our common  stock with a market value (as  determined  under the
rights plan) equal to twice the  exercise  price.  In the event that,  after any
Person   becomes  an   Acquiring   Person,   we  engage  in   certain   mergers,
consolidations,  or sales of assets  representing  50% or more of our  assets or
earning  power with an  Acquiring  Person (or Persons  acting on behalf of or in
concert  with an  Acquiring  Person) or in which all holders of common stock are
not  treated  alike,  the rights  will be  exercisable  for common  stock of the
acquiring or surviving  company  with a market  value (as  determined  under the
rights  plan)  equal  to  twice  the  exercise  price.  The  rights  will not be
exercisable  by any Acquiring  Person.  The rights are  redeemable at a price of
$0.01 per right  prior to any Person  becoming  an  Acquiring  Person or,  under
certain circumstances, after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person.

NOTE 24 - DIVIDENDS DECLARED
We declared dividends of $0.220,  $0.165 and $0.220 for the years 2002, 2001 and

    non-strategic inventory product lines which we intended to exit.
(3) In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded the following significant expenses:

The sum of the quarterly  net income  available per common share amounts may not
total to full year amounts,  since these computations are made independently for
each quarter and full year and take into account the weighted  average number of
common stock equivalent shares outstanding for each period, including the effect
of dilutive securities for that period.

a majority  of the shares  present  in person or by proxy and  entitled  to vote
thereat  shall have power to adjourn the meeting to another  time, or to another
time and place,  without  notice other than  announcement  of adjournment at the

of Directors  for the  determination  of  stockholders  entitled to vote at such

limitation,  electronically,  via telegram, internet, interactive voice response
system, or other means of electronic transmission executed or authorized by such
stockholder  or his  attorney-in-fact,  but no proxy  shall be voted after three
years from its date,  unless the proxy provides for a longer  period.  Any proxy

by stockholders  present in person or by proxy,  except as otherwise required by
the Certificate of Incorporation or the laws of the State of Delaware. Unless so
directed by the chairman of the meeting, or required by the laws of the State of
Delaware, the vote thereat on any question need not be by ballot.

     On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting,
or in his name by his proxy, if there be such proxy,  and shall state the number
of shares  voted by him and the number of votes to which each share is entitled.
On a vote by ballot, the chairman shall appoint two inspectors of election,  who
shall first take and subscribe an oath or affirmation  faithfully to execute the

     than 120 days before the date of the Corporation's proxy statement release
     to shareholders in connection with the Corporation's previous year's annual
     meeting of stockholders. To be timely in the case of a special meeting or
     in the event that the date of the annual meeting is changed by more than 30
     days from such anniversary date, a stockholder's notice must be received at
     the principal executive offices of the Corporation no later than the close
     of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the day on which
     notice of the meeting date was mailed or public disclosure of the meeting

     disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
     Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document
     publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange

     the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting,
     (ii) with respect to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to
     nominate for election as a director, all information relating to such
     person (including such person(s) written consent to being named in the
     proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director) that is required
     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (iii) the name and
     address, as they appear on the Corporation's records, of the stockholder

     the proposal or nomination is made, (iv) the class and number of shares of
     capital stock of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record
     by such stockholder of record and by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose

     relationship that such stockholder of record and/or the beneficial owner,
     if any, on whose behalf the proposal or nomination is made may respectively
     have in such business or with such nominee. At the request of the Board of
     Directors, any person nominated for election as a director shall furnish to
     the Secretary of the Corporation the information required to be set forth
     in a stockholder(s) notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee.

     business shall be conducted, and no person shall be nominated to serve as a
     director, at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, except in
     accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8. The Chairman of

     accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws and, if he shall
     so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting, and any such business not
     properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted and any
     defective nomination shall be disregarded. A stockholder shall also comply
     with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
     as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
     matters set forth in this Section 8.

     disapproval at the annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and
     committees of the Board of Directors, but, in connection with such reports,
     no business shall be acted upon at such annual meeting unless stated, filed
     and received as herein provided.

Board by means of conference telephone or similar communication  equipment or by
other  means  provided  all persons  participating  in the meeting can hear each

presence in person at such meeting.

     Any  director  may waive  notice of any meeting by a writing  signed by the
director entitled to the notice and filed with the minutes or corporate records.
The attendance at or participation of the director at a meeting shall constitute
waiver of notice of such  meeting,  unless the director at the  beginning of the
meeting  or  promptly  upon his  arrival  objects  to  holding  the  meeting  or
transacting business at the meeting.

of  attendance  at each  meeting  of the  Board of  Directors,  a fixed  sum for
attendance  at each  meeting  of the Board of  Directors  and/or a stated fee as

of the  Executive  Committee  and/or of other  committees  may be  allowed  like
compensation and reimbursement of expenses for attending committee meetings.

     SECTION 7. Chairman.  From its members, the Board of Directors will elect a
chairman to preside  over  meetings of the  shareholders  and of the Board.  The

                              CERTIFICATES OF STOCK

     SECTION  1.  Form and  Execution  of  Certificates.  The  interest  of each
stockholder  of  the  Corporation   shall  be  evidenced  by  a  certificate  or
certificates  for shares of stock in such form as may be prescribed from time to
time by law and by the Board of  Directors.  The  certificates  of stock of each
class and series now  authorized  or which may  hereafter be  authorized  by the
Certificate  of  Incorporation  shall be  consecutively  numbered  and signed by
either the Chairman of the Board or the CEO or the President or a Vice President
together either with the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or
an  Assistant  Treasurer  of  the  Corporation,  and  may be  countersigned  and
registered  in such manner as the Board of Directors  may  prescribe,  and shall
bear the corporate seal or a printed or engraved  facsimile  thereof.  Where any
such  certificate  is  signed by a  transfer  agent or  transfer  clerk and by a
registrar,  the  signatures of any such Chairman of the Board,  CEO,  President,
Vice President, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary or Assistant Secretary
upon such certificate may be facsimiles engraved or printed. The signatures by a
transfer  agent or transfer  clerk and by a registrar may be either in facsimile
form or manual form.  In case any officer or officers who shall have signed,  or
whose  facsimile  signature  or  signatures  shall have been placed  upon,  such
certificate or  certificates  shall have ceased to be such,  whether  because of
death,  resignation or otherwise,  before such certificate or certificates shall
have  been  issued  and  delivered,   such   certificate  or  certificates   may
nevertheless  be issued and delivered with the same effect as if such officer or
officers had not ceased to be such at the date of its issue and delivery.

     SECTION 2. Transfer of Shares.  The shares of the stock of the  Corporation
shall be  transferred  on the books of the  Corporation by the holder thereof in
person or by his attorney lawfully constituted,  upon surrender for cancellation
of certificates  for the same number of shares,  with an assignment and power of
transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, with such proof or
guaranty of the  authenticity  of the signature as the Corporation or its agents
may reasonably require. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of
record  of any  share or  shares  of stock as the  holder  in fact  thereof  and
accordingly  shall not be bound to recognize  any equitable or other claim to or
interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person  whether or not
it shall have express or other  notice  thereof,  except as otherwise  expressly
provided by law.

     SECTION  3.  Closing  of  Transfer  Books and  Record  Dates.  The Board of
Directors  may in its  discretion  prescribe  in advance a period not  exceeding
sixty (60) days prior to the date of any meeting of the stockholders or prior to
the last day on which the consent or dissent of stockholders  may be effectively
expressed for any purpose  without a meeting,  during which no transfer of stock
on the  books of the  Corporation  may be made;  or in lieu of  prohibiting  the
transfer of stock, may fix in advance a time not more than sixty (60) days prior
to the date of any meeting of stockholders or prior to the last day on which the
consent or dissent of stockholders may be effectively  expressed for any purpose
without a meeting,  as the time as of which  stockholders  entitled to notice of
and to vote at such a meeting or whose  consent or dissent is required or may be
expressed  for any  purpose,  as the case may be, shall be  determined;  and all
persons  who were  holders of record of voting  stock at such time and no others
shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such  meeting or to express  their
consent or  dissent,  as the case may be,  notwithstanding  any  transfer of any
stock on the books of the Corporation  after any record date fixed as aforesaid.
The Board of Directors  may also, in its  discretion,  fix in advance a date not
exceeding  sixty  (60) days  preceding  the date  fixed for the  payment  of any
dividend or the making of any  distribution,  or for the delivery of evidence of
rights,  or  evidences  of  interests  arising  out  of  any  issuance,  change,
conversion or exchange of capital stock, as a record date for the  determination
of the  stockholders  entitled to receive or  participate  in any such dividend,
distribution, rights or interests,  notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on
the books of the  Corporation  after any record date fixed as aforesaid,  or, at
its  option,  in lieu of so fixing a record  date,  may  prescribe  in advance a
period  not  exceeding  sixty  (60)  days  prior to the  date for such  payment,
distribution  or delivery  during which no transfer of stock on the books of the
Corporation may be made.

     SECTION  4.  Lost  or  Destroyed  Certificates.  In  case  of the  loss  or
destruction of any  outstanding  certificate  of stock, a new certificate may be
issued upon the following conditions:

     The  owner  of said  certificate  shall  file  with  the  Secretary  of the
Corporation an affidavit  giving the facts in relation to the ownership,  and in
relation to the loss or destruction of said certificate,  stating its number and
the number of shares represented thereby;  such affidavit to be in such form and
contain such statements as shall satisfy the Chairman of the Board and Secretary
that said  certificate has been  accidentally  destroyed or lost, and that a new
certificate  ought to be issued in lieu thereof.  Upon being so  satisfied,  the
Chairman of the Board and  Secretary  shall  require such owner to file with the
Secretary a bond in such penal sum and in such form as they may deem  advisable,
and with a surety or sureties  approved by them,  to indemnify and save harmless
the  Corporation  from  any  claim,  loss,  damage  or  liability  which  may be
occasioned by the issuance of a new certificate in lieu thereof, or if they deem
it appropriate,  to waive the  requirement to secure a bond with a surety.  Upon
such bond being so filed, a new  certificate for the same number of shares shall
be issued to the owner of the certificate so lost or destroyed; and the transfer
agent and registrar of stock,  if any, shall  countersign  and register such new
certificate  upon receipt of a written  order signed by the said Chairman of the
Board and  Secretary,  and  thereupon  the  Corporation  will save harmless said
transfer  agent and registrar in the  premises.  The CEO or the President or any
Vice President may act hereunder in the stead of the Chairman of the Board,  and
an Assistant  Secretary in the stead of the Secretary.  In case of the surrender
of the original certificate, in lieu of which a new certificate has been issued,
or the  surrender  of  such  new  certificate,  for  cancellation,  the  bond of
indemnity  given as a  condition  of the  issue of such new  certificate  may be
surrendered.  A new certificate may be issued without requiring any bond when in
the judgment of the Board of Directors it is proper to do so.

                                   ARTICLE VII

be signed by the CEO, the President,  any Executive Vice President,  Senior Vice
President,  or Vice President and by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary or
the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer,  or by such other officer or officers,
agent or agents, as shall be thereunto authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors.

President,  any  Executive  Vice  President,  or Senior Vice  President  or Vice
President of the  Corporation  may authorize from time to time the signature and
issuance of proxies to vote upon shares of stock of other companies  standing in
the name of the Corporation. All such proxies shall be signed in the name of the
Corporation by the Chairman of the Board, the CEO, President, any Executive Vice
President,  Senior Vice  President or Vice  President and by the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary.

                             RADIOSHACK CORPORATION
                       UNFUNDED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                                 FOR DIRECTORS
                    (AS AMENDED AND RESTATED JULY 22, 2000)


1.   PURPOSES OF THE PLAN

     The purposes of the Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan") are to
enable  RadioShack  Corporation  (the  "Company") to attract and retain the best
qualified  members of the Board of  Directors of the Company (a  "Director")  by
providing them with a Plan to defer the payment of all or a specified portion of
the fees payable to the Director for services rendered on behalf of the Company.

2.   ELECTION TO DEFER

     a)    A  Director  may elect on or before  December  31 of any year,  to
defer payment  of all or a  specified  part of either  all  his/her  retainer
fees or meeting fees or both  (whether paid in cash or in Common Stock of the
Company or dividends attributable thereto), for services and meetings during the
succeeding calendar year following  such  election.  Any person who shall become
a Director during  any  calendar  year,  and who was not a Director  of the
Company on the preceding  December 31, may elect,  not later than the 30th day
after his or her term begins,  to defer  payment of all or a specified  part of
such fees for the succeeding  calendar year.  Any such  elections  shall be made
by written notice delivered to the Corporate Secretary of the Company. All
elections shall only be effective for the succeeding  calendar year.
Notwithstanding the above, for the calendar  year 1998,  any such  election must
be made prior to February 28, 1998 for director retainer fees and prior to
July 1, 1998 for meeting fees.

     b)    In addition  to a) above,  any  Director  with a cash  account  shall
be entitled to make a one-time  election  only to  transfer  out of his or her
cash account and have his or her stock account  credited with such amount of
cash and accrued  interest  as a Director  may elect from his or her cash
account.  This election shall be effective as of July 1, 1999. Upon this
election,  the elected amount credited to a Director's  stock account shall be
converted to that amount of Company  Common Stock based upon the closing price
of Company Common Stock on June 30, 1999. Such one-time election must be made no
later than July 1, 1999.

     c)    With respect to cash  dividends  payable on Company  Common Stock,
each participating  Director  holding a stock account or Pension Plan Stock
Account, upon his or her election may (i) be directly paid in cash,  (ii) have
his or her cash  account  credited as of the payment date for  dividends on
Company  Common Stock in an amount  equal to dividends  attributable  to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock credited to each  Director's  stock
account or Pension Plan Stock Account as of the record date set by the Board of
Directors of the Company or (iii)  defer cash  dividends  into his or her stock
account or Pension  Plan Stock  Account.  Cash  dividends  deferred and
credited to a  Director's  stock account or Pension  Plan Stock  Account  shall
be  converted  to that  amount of Company  Common Stock based on the closing
price of Company Common Stock on such record date for dividends.

     d)    Amounts deferred under this Plan will be distributed based on one of
the two following elections made by each participating Director:

           (1)    consecutive substantially equal annual installments up to a
           maximum of ten beginning on January 15 of a specified year; or

           (2)    a lump sum payment on a specified date not in excess of ten
           years from the date Director ceases to be a Director.

3.   DIRECTORS' ACCOUNTS

     a)    Cash Account

           All deferred  cash fees shall be recorded on the books of the Company
and a memorandum cash account of the fees deferred by each participating
Director and interest  thereon and cash dividends  payable on Company  Common
Stock,  if any, will be maintained.

     b)    Stock Account

           All deferred retainer fees payable in Common Stock of the Company
("Company Common Stock") and the Additional  Items (as defined below) shall be
recorded on the books of the Company and a memorandum  stock  account of the
fees in Company Common Stock deferred by each  participating  Director will be
maintained.  The Director's  stock account shall be credited with the number of
shares of Company Common Stock otherwise  payable to each  participating
Director under the terms and in the amounts and on the dates set forth in each
of the Company's Incentive Stock Plans, as the case may be, providing for the
compensation of Directors, if they so elect,  in Company  Common Stock.  All
deferred  meeting fees payable in Company  Common  Stock shall also be recorded
on the books of the Company in the participating  Director's  stock account
under the terms,  in the amounts and on the dates as set by the Board of
Directors  for the  payment of  meeting  fees. Meeting fees elected to be
deferred by a Director in Company Common Stock on and after June 1, 1998 shall
be  converted  to that amount of Company  Common  Stock equal  to the  closing
price  of  Company  Common  Stock  as of the date of the applicable director or
committee meeting and if not a trading day then the first trading day prior to
the meeting. Cash dividends payable on Company Common Stock or a Director's  one
time election  amount as provided in Sections 1 b) and 1 c) above  (collectively
the "Additional  Items") shall be recorded in a Director's stock account in an
amount and in the manner as provided in the Plan.

     If a Director's stock account is credited with shares of Company Common
Stock by reason of a deferral of either retainer fees or meeting fees or both on
or after January 1, 1998, or a deferral of the Additional Items and payment of
all of the Company Common Stock (earned by virtue of retainer fees, meeting fees
or both or the Additional Items) are deferred (a) until after December 31st of
the third calendar year which follows the calendar year during which such
deferrals are initially made or (b) until after the earlier of (i) December 31st
of such third calendar year or (ii) the day the Director ceases to be a
Director, the Director's stock account shall be credited with an additional
number of shares of Company Common Stock (including fractions thereof) equal to
twenty-five percent of the shares of Company Common Stock initially credited.

     c)    Pension Plan Stock Account

           Effective December 31, 1997, the Special Compensation Plan for
Directors (the "Pension Plan") was terminated and in terminating the Pension
Plan, the Company calculated the single sum present value of each Pension Plan
participant's benefit and converted that amount to Company Common Stock based on
the average of the closing prices of Company Common Stock for 1997. The amount
of the Company Common Stock shall be recorded on the books of the Company and a
memorandum account reflecting such amounts for each Director formerly
participating in the Pension Plan will be maintained (the "Pension Plan Stock
Account").

4.   PAYMENT FROM DIRECTORS' ACCOUNTS

     a)    Payment of amounts credited to a Director's cash account shall be
made in cash. Payment of amounts credited to a Director's stock account or
Pension Plan Stock Account shall be made in Company Common Stock. Fractional
Company Common Stock interests, if any, shall be payable in cash. With respect
to cash dividends payable on Company Common Stock, each participating Director
holding a stock account or Pension Plan Stock Account, upon his or her election
may (i) be directly paid in cash, (ii) have his or her cash account credited as
of the payment date for dividends on Company Common Stock in an amount equal to
dividends attributable to the number of shares of Company Common Stock credited
to each Director's stock account or Pension Plan Stock Account as of the record
date set by the Board of Directors of the Company or (iii) defer cash dividends
into his or her stock account or Pension Plan Stock Account. Cash dividends
deferred and credited to a director's stock account or Pension Plan Stock
Account shall be converted to that amount of Company Common Stock based on the
closing price of Company Common Stock on the payment date for dividends.

     b) The aggregate amount credited to the account of any Director, at the
election of the Director, shall be paid to the Director, either (i) in a lump
sum on the date specified by the Director, (ii) in substantially equal annual
installments not exceeding ten, (iii) in a lump sum, upon a Change in Control or
threatened Change in Control (as hereafter defined), on a date specified by the
Board of Directors prior to any Change in Control, or (iv) if no election is
made, on 60 days following the date a Director ceases to be a director. If a
Director elects to receive installments, the first installment shall be paid (x)
in advance on January 15 of the following calendar year in which the Director
ceases to be a Director of the Company and subsequent installments (not
exceeding nine) shall be paid promptly on January 15 of each of the succeeding
calendar years, or (y) on the date specified by the Director.

     c) Any Director with a Pension Plan Stock Account shall be entitled to
make an election as to the method of payment of Company Common Stock from his or
her Pension Plan Stock Account. Such election must be made prior to April 1,
1998. In such election, each Director shall elect the method of payment (either
single payment or 10 or less annual installments) and the date such payment will
be made or begin to be made. If any Director does not elect a method of payment
or a date of such payment, then the amount of such Director's Pension Plan Stock
Account shall be distributed to him or her, in a single sum, 60 days following
the day the individual ceases to be a Director.

For  purposes of the Plan a "Change in Control"  shall have the same  meaning as
set forth in the RadioShack Corporation 1993 Incentive Stock Plan as amended.

5.   INTEREST

     On the last day of each calendar quarter interest shall be credited to each
Director's cash account calculated on the unpaid balance in such cash account as
calculated from time to time during the quarter. The rate of interest to be
credited will be 1% per annum less than the announced prime rate of the Bank of
America, N.A. as the same shall exist from time to time during the quarter.

6.   PAYMENT IN EVENT OF DEATH

     If a Director should die before all deferred amounts credited to the
Director's cash account, stock account or Pension Plan Stock Account have been
distributed, the balance of any deferred fees, dividends if any, and interest
then in the Director's account shall be paid promptly to the Director's
designated beneficiary in the manner designated by the Director or if no method
is selected within 60 days after the Director's death. If such Director did not
designate a beneficiary or in the event that the beneficiary or beneficiaries
designated by such Director shall have predeceased the Director, the balance in
the Director's account shall be paid promptly to the Director's estate.

7.   TERMINATION OF ELECTION

     A Director may terminate his election to defer payment of one or more of
his or her retainer fees, meeting fees or cash dividends payable on Company
Common Stock by written notice delivered to the Corporate Secretary of the
Company. Such termination shall become effective as of the end of the calendar
year in which notice of termination is given with respect to the retainer fees,
meeting fees or dividends payable during subsequent calendar years. Amounts
credited to the account of a Director prior to the effective date of termination
shall not be affected thereby and shall be paid only in accordance with Sections
4 and 6 above.

8.   RIGHTS UNSECURED

     The right of any Director to receive payment of deferred amounts under the
provisions of the Plan shall be an unsecured claim against the general assets of
the Company. The maintenance of individual Director accounts is for bookkeeping
purposes only. The Company is not obligated to acquire or set aside any
particular assets for the discharge of its obligations, nor shall any Director
have any property rights in any particular assets held by the Company, whether
or not held for the purpose of funding the Company's obligations hereunder.

9.   NONASSIGNABILITY

     During the Director's lifetime, the right to any deferred fees, dividends
if any, and interest thereon may not be transferred, assigned, hypothecated or
pledged. Any such attempt to transfer, assign, hypothecate or pledge the account
shall be void.

10.  INTERPRETATION AND AMENDMENT

     The Plan shall be administered by the Corporate Governance Committee of the
Company. The decision of such Committee with respect to any questions arising as
to the interpretation of this Plan, including the severability of any and all of
the provisions thereof, shall be final, conclusive and binding. The Company
reserves the right to modify this Plan from time to time or to repeal the Plan
entirely, provided, however, that no modification of this Plan shall operate to
annul an election already in effect for the current calendar year or any
preceding calendar year.

11.  EFFECTIVE DATE

     The effective date of this Plan will be December 15, 1995 when it was
adopted.

Name

Dear Name:

     For the past several  months,  the  company's  Leadership  Council has been
finalizing our 2002 operational plan and budget.  This comprehensive  roadmap is
intended to strengthen our company's  performance and provide us the opportunity
to  achieve  _%  earnings  per share  (EPS)  growth.  As a valued  member of the
RadioShack  team, we want you to have the  opportunity to share in the company's
growth through your overall  compensation  plan. It is my pleasure to inform you
of your fiscal year 2002 bonus opportunity.

     Your 2002 bonus program rewards you for increased performance and
     effectiveness in the following areas:

     1)  Earnings per share growth; and
     2)  RadioShack stock performance enhancement.

     Your maximum bonus opportunity for fiscal year 2002 is equal to _% of
your base salary and includes the bonus components listed above. To help you
chart your bonus earnings throughout the year, we have attached a Bonus
Calculator (Attachment A). A brief description of each bonus component is
detailed below.
             ------------------------------------------------------

                         Earnings Per Share (EPS) Bonus

o  Your EPS bonus is based on the percentage increase of 2002 actual diluted
   EPS results over the company's 2001 adjusted diluted EPS of $_ per share.
   The goal of the company is to achieve a _% increase over the prior year.

o  You begin earning bonus when the company achieves a _% growth in EPS over
   last year.

o  For each percentage point increase above _% (rounded to the nearest decimal),
   you will achieve incremental bonus pay out.

o  2002 EPS will be subject to adjustments for significant non-recurring items
   as determined by the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board.

                                    ~~~~~~~~

                                   Stock Bonus

o  You are eligible for an additional bonus payout if RadioShack Corporation's
   (RSH) average daily closing stock price outperforms the Standard & Poor's
   Specialty Retail Group's average daily closing stock price.

o  This additional stock bonus will only be paid if: (1) a positive increase
   in stock price over the prior year occurs; (2) the percentage increase
   exceeds the S & P Specialty Retail Group's percentage daily increase from
   the prior year; and (3) the company's minimum growth of _% EPS is met.
               ---------------------------------------------------

Page 2...Date, 2002....Fiscal Year 2002 Compensation


     This outline of your compensation plan is not an employment contract, but a
method of calculating your total earnings.  You forfeit your rights to receive a
bonus if you resign before the end of the current  fiscal year. If you retire at
age 55 or over,  provided the Company has given its  consent,  or you die before
the end of the then current  fiscal year,  your bonus will be  calculated  using
actual  results to the nearest end of the month  preceding  or  succeeding  such
event,  which  will then be  adjusted  using the latest  budget to  include  the
remaining months of the fiscal year. Should you be eligible for a bonus pay out,
the amount will be paid to you or the legal representative of your estate.

     If at any time  during  your  continued  employment,  your  responsibility,
duties or title changes,  this plan is subject to revision or termination by the
Company at the time of the foregoing change. A partial fiscal year bonus will be
calculated using the methodology described above.

     We have an exciting year ahead of us - a year that will require  excellence
in  execution.  Your  focus,  dedication  and  sheer  hard  work  will  give the
RadioShack team ....the POWER TO WIN!

Sincerely,
<PAGE>
