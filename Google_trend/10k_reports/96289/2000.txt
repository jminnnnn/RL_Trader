PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL
Tandy Corporation, a Delaware corporation,  was incorporated in 1967 ("Tandy" or
the  "Company").  Tandy  primarily  engages  in  the  retail  sale  of  consumer
electronics  through the RadioShack(R) store chain. Sales derived outside of the
United States are not material.

RadioShack. At December 31, 1999, RadioShack operated 5,087 company-owned stores
located throughout the United States.  These stores average  approximately 2,300
square feet in gross area and are located in major malls and strip  centers,  as
well as individual store fronts.  RadioShack had, on the same date, a network of
2,099  dealer/franchise  stores.  These stores  provide  RadioShack  products to
smaller  communities.   The  dealers  are  generally  engaged  in  other  retail
operations  and  augment  their sales with  RadioShack  products.  This  network
included 58 international dealers at December 31, 1999.

The  company-owned  RadioShack  stores carry a broad  assortment of both private
label and third party  products,  including  electronic  parts and  accessories,
cellular, PCS and conventional  telephones,  audio and video equipment,  digital
satellite  systems,   personal  computers  and  related  products,  as  well  as
specialized  products  such as scanners  and  weather  radios.  RadioShack  also
provides  consumers  access to third party services such as cellular phone,  PCS
and pager activation, direct satellite programming,  Internet access and prepaid
wireless airtime.

RadioShack.com,  LLC. In October 1999, Tandy launched its RadioShack.com website
to increase its online and store level retail sales. As of March 1, 2000,  there
were over 20,000 products on the website. Online customers can purchase,  return
or  exchange  products  available  on the  RadioShack  website  at  their  local
RadioShack stores and participating dealer/franchise outlets.

Strategic  Alliances.  Tandy has formed strategic alliances with well-recognized
partners.  Through its  telecommunications  alliances with Sprint Communications
Company and Sprint PCS ("Sprint"),  RadioShack customers have access to wireless
and residential  telephones and related  telephony  products and services at the
"Sprint Store at RadioShack." Compaq Computer Corporation ("Compaq") is the sole
supplier  of personal  computers  sold  through  RadioShack  retail  outlets and
DIRECTV provides  direct-to-home  satellite programming.  On May 13, 1999, Tandy
entered  into a  multi-year  retail  sales and service  agreement  with  Thomson
Multimedia ("Thomson"),  which owns the RCA brand. Under this agreement, Thomson
will supply RadioShack with various  RCA-branded audio and video components such
as  televisions,  VCRs,  camcorders,  digital video disc (DVD) players,  digital
cameras, CD shelf systems and other digital entertainment  products beginning in
2000. Some of these items are currently  available in stores.  RCA products will
be sold  through  the RCA  Digital  Entertainment  Center  at  RadioShack  via a
"store-within-a-store" concept similar to the Sprint Store at RadioShack.

Tandy entered into two additional  agreements  during 1999 which it believes are
significant  steps towards  achieving  Tandy's  strategic plan for RadioShack to
become  "America's  Connectivity  Store,"  similar  to its  existing  concept of
"America's  Telephone Store." Connectivity will provide solutions for connecting
to and utilizing high-speed bandwidth.  Bandwidth refers to volume at which data
can be transmitted and, depending on the volume delivered,  may enable consumers
to have such  capabilities  as instant  and/or  high speed  Internet,  movies on
demand and multiple phone/fax connections through a single phone or cable line.

On November 11, 1999, Tandy Corporation announced a five-year strategic alliance
with  Microsoft   Corporation   ("Microsoft")  that  encompasses  broadband  and
narrowband  technology,  as well as in-store  and online  efforts.  In the third
quarter of 2000,  RadioShack  and Microsoft are expected to launch The Microsoft
Internet Center @ RadioShack via a "store-within-a-store"  concept in as many as
5,000 company-owned RadioShack stores and participating dealer/franchise outlets
nationwide.  The Microsoft  Internet Center @ RadioShack will allow customers to
view  demonstrations  of narrowband  and broadband  technology  and subscribe to
MSN(TM) dial-up or broadband  Internet access,  as well as view a broad range of
existing  and  future  products,  solutions  and  services  based  on  Microsoft
technologies.

Also,  on April 21,  1999,  Tandy  announced  it had  entered  into a  strategic
agreement with NorthPoint  Communications,  Inc.  ("NorthPoint"),  a provider of
Digital Subscriber Line ("DSL")  technology.  DSL technology  transports data at
speeds up to 25 times faster than common dial-up modems, allowing for high-speed
Internet access and other data-intensive  applications.  Management  anticipates
this  alliance  will  accelerate  the  adoption  rate of  these  services  at an
affordable  price to the mass  market.  Additionally,  NorthPoint  will  provide
RadioShack with DSL services for consumer display purposes in many of its retail
stores, as well as for internal use. NorthPoint currently operates in 33 markets
in the U.S. and expects to expand its service territory to 60 markets by the end
of 2000.

Retail Support Operations.

    AmeriLink  Corporation  ("AmeriLink")  - On July 30,  1999,  Tandy  acquired
    AmeriLink.  Through its 76 field offices  located in 26 states,  AmeriLink
    designs,   installs  and  maintains  cabling  systems  for  the transmission
    of video,  voice and data,  primarily for home use.  AmeriLink will continue
    to provide  these  services to outside  parties and,  also, to RadioShack
    through AmeriLink's  RadioShack  Installation  Services Division.  Services
    for RadioShack in 2000 will consist  primarily of customer  DIRECTV
    installations;  however,  new services  such as home  theater and  broadband
    Internet access, among others, will be added as RadioShack's needs dictate.

    A&A International Limited Partnership ("A&A") - This limited partnership,
    which is 100% owned by Tandy and its subsidiaries, serves  the  wide-ranging
    international  import/export,  sourcing,  evaluation,  logistics and quality
    control needs of Tandy.  A&A also provides  services for outside  customers,
    primarily InterTAN,  Inc. ("InterTAN").  Most of A&A's activity for InterTAN
    involves sourcing of goods from manufacturers in Asia.

    Consumer  Electronics  Manufacturing  - Tandy operates  seven  manufacturing
    facilities in the United States and one overseas manufacturing  operation in
    China,  which  is a joint  venture.  These  eight  manufacturing  facilities
    employed  approximately  3,200  employees  as of December  31,  1999.  Tandy
    manufactures  a variety of  products,  primarily  sold  through  RadioShack,
    including audio, video,  telephony,  antennas, wire and cable products and a
    wide variety of "hard to find" parts for consumer electronic products.

    Tandy Service Centers - Tandy maintains a service and support network to
    service the consumer electronics and personal computer retail industry in
    the U.S. At December 31, 1999, there were 55 Tandy Service Centers in the
    U.S. which repair name-brand and private label  products sold at RadioShack.
    Tandy is also a vendor-authorized  service provider for such leading
    manufacturers as Compaq, Sony, Panasonic,  Hitachi,  Hewlett-Packard,  RCA/
    Thomson and Nokia, among others, and also performs repairs for third-party
    service centers and extended service plan providers under national service
    agreements.

    Regional  Distribution  Centers - The 11 distribution  centers operated by
    Tandy ship  over one  million  cartons  each  month to  RadioShack  stores.
    A few distribution centers also serve as fulfillment centers for
    RadioShack.com.

    Tandy Customer Support - Using state-of-the-art telephone and data networks,
    Tandy Customer Support responds to more than five million calls annually for
    answers to technical questions, customer service inquiries, and direct sales
    requests related to RadioShack's  catalog operations,  its website and "hard
    to find" products offered through the RadioShack Unlimited program.

Computer  City.  On August 31,  1998,  Tandy  completed  the sale of 100% of the
outstanding  common  stock of its  Computer  City,  Inc.  subsidiary  ("CCI"  or
"Computer City") to CompUSA Inc. ("CompUSA"). (See "Sale of Computer City, Inc."
in Item 7  "Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Results of Operations  and
Financial Condition" ("MD&A")).  Prior to the sale, there were 101 Computer City
stores open,  including  seven in Canada.  Operating  primarily as a supercenter
format, the average store size approximated 21,050 square feet in gross area and
offered approximately 4,000 products in its merchandising assortment,  including
personal computer hardware and software and related products and accessories.

SEASONALITY
As is the case  with  other  retail  businesses,  Tandy's  net  sales  and other
revenues are greater  during the  Christmas  season than during other periods of
the year. There is a corresponding  pre-seasonal  inventory  build-up  requiring
working capital associated with the anticipated increased sales volume. See Note
26 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for quarterly data.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
Tandy owns or is licensed to use many  trademarks  and service  marks related to
its  business  in the  United  States  and in foreign  countries.  Radio  Shack,
RadioShack,  RadioShack.com, You've got questions. We've got answers., America's
Home Connectivity  Store, and Around The Corner and Around The Clock are some of
the marks most widely used by the Company.  Tandy  believes that the  RadioShack
name and marks are well-recognized by consumers, and that the name and marks are
associated with high-quality  service.  Tandy's  manufactured  products are sold
primarily  under the  RadioShack  trademark.  Tandy  also owns  various  patents
relating to  electronic  products  designed  and  manufactured  by Tandy.  Tandy
believes  that the loss of the  RadioShack  name and  RadioShack  marks would be
material to its business.

SUPPLIERS
Tandy's marketing strategy for RadioShack  depends, in part, upon its ability to
offer  both  private  label  and name  brand  products,  as well as third  party
services,  to its customers.  Tandy utilizes a large number of suppliers located
in various  parts of the world to obtain its raw  materials  and  private  label
merchandise.  Management  does not expect a lack of availability of raw material
or any single private label product to have a material impact on its operations.
In terms of name brand products sold by RadioShack, no single vendor provided in
excess of 10% of Tandy's aggregate product purchases in 1999.  However,  certain
vendors,  strategic  partners and service providers are considered  important to
RadioShack's  business and the loss of or disruption in supply from one of these
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on  RadioShack's  sales.  Additionally,
certain suppliers have, at times, limited their supply of products to Tandy.

BACKLOG ORDERS
Tandy has no material backlog of orders for the products it sells.

COMPETITION
Consumer  electronics  retailers  realized  increased  sales in 1999,  driven by
strong  consumer  spending and a continued  demand for  wireless  communications
products,  personal computers and satellite systems, as well as a rapid consumer
acceptance  of new digital  technology  products.  Despite  these  factors,  the
consumer electronics retail business still remains highly competitive, driven by
technology and product cycles, as well as the overall state of the economy.

In the consumer  electronics  retailing  business,  competitive  factors include
price,   availability,   product  quality  and  features,   consumer   services,
manufacturing  and  distribution  capability  and brand  reputation.  RadioShack
competes in the sale of its  products and  services  with large format  consumer
electronics  retailers  such as  Circuit  City  and  Best  Buy,  department  and
specialty  stores  such as Sears  and The Home  Depot,  mass  merchants  such as
Wal-Mart and Target, and alternative channels of distribution such as mail-order
and  e-commerce.  With  respect to the  products  sold by  RadioShack,  numerous
domestic and foreign  companies  manufacture some of the same products which are
sold under nationally recognized brand names or private labels in markets common
to RadioShack.

Management  believes  that  RadioShack's  primary   differentiating  factors  in
relation to its competitive  position are its extensive physical retail presence
with over 7,100 conveniently located company-owned and dealer/franchise  outlets
nationwide,  as well as its  specially  trained  sales  staff,  who are  able to
provide enhanced product explanation,  assist customers with service activation,
where  applicable,  and assist with the  selection of  appropriate  products and
accessories.

Another   differentiating   factor  is  RadioShack's  strategic  alliances  with
well-recognized  partners including Sprint for  telecommunications  and wireless
communications, Compaq for personal computers, Thomson for RCA-branded audio and
video products,  Microsoft for broadband and narrowband technology,  and DIRECTV
for  "direct-to-home"  satellite  systems  and  services,  among  others.  These
alliances   augment  the  strong  position  that  RadioShack  has   historically
maintained  in its core product  categories  such as  batteries,  communications
equipment,   telephony,  antennas  and  parts  and  accessories.   Additionally,
RadioShack is able to leverage  name brand  recognition,  marketing  efforts and
advertising   campaigns   with  its  partners  and  also  create   cross-revenue
opportunities  for  repair  service  income,  customer  residuals  and  cellular
commissions.

Given the highly competitive nature of the consumer electronics retail business,
no assurance can be given that RadioShack will continue to compete  successfully
with  respect to each of the factors  referenced  above.  Also,  in light of the
ever-changing  nature of the electronics  retail  industry,  RadioShack would be
adversely  affected  if its  competitors  were able to offer  their  products at
significantly  lower prices,  introduce  innovative or technologically  superior
products not yet available to  RadioShack or if RadioShack  was unable to obtain
certain products in a timely manner for an extended period of time.

With  respect to the  expansion  of the  Internet,  management  does not believe
e-commerce  retailers currently provide  significant  competition to RadioShack.
This, however, could change and become significant over time. Management further
believes that Tandy to well  positioned to meet the increased  competition  from
Internet retailers with its recently launched RadioShack.com initiative, coupled
with RadioShack's extensive physical retail presence,  services capabilities and
wide assortment of consumer electronics products.

EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 1999, Tandy had approximately  40,800 employees.  That number
included  approximately  8,800 temporary retail employees who were hired for the
Christmas  selling season.  None of Tandy's  employees are covered by collective
bargaining  agreements nor are they members of labor unions.  Tandy's management
considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
Information on Tandy's properties is in Management's Discussion and Analysis and
the financial  statements  included in this Form 10-K and is  incorporated  into
this Item 2 by  reference.  The  following  items are  discussed  further on the
referenced pages:

                                                  Page
Retail Outlets...............................      13
Property, Plant and Equipment................      42
Leases.......................................      45

Tandy  leases,  rather  than  owns,  most  of  its  retail  and  service  center
facilities.  RadioShack  stores are located  primarily in major shopping  malls,
stand-alone  buildings or shopping  centers owned by other entities.  Tandy owns
most of the property on which its executive offices are located in downtown Fort
Worth,  Texas, all distribution  centers,  except for two which are leased,  and
most of its manufacturing  facilities  located throughout the United States. A&A
leases  six  administrative  offices  in the Asia  Pacific  region.  AmeriLink's
headquarters  and field offices are also leased.  Existing  warehouse and office
facilities are deemed adequate to meet Tandy's needs in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
Tandy has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties,  investigations
and pending  actions  involving  allegations  of  negligence,  product  defects,
discrimination,  infringement of intellectual property rights, tax deficiencies,
violations  of permits or  licenses,  and breach of contract  and other  matters
against  Tandy and its  subsidiaries  incident to the operation of its business.
The liability,  if any,  associated  with these matters was not  determinable at
December 31, 1999.  Although  occasional adverse  settlements or resolutions may
occur  and  negatively  impact  earnings  in the year of  settlement,  it is the
opinion of management that their ultimate  resolution will not have a materially
adverse effect on Tandy's financial position.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
No  matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders  during the fourth
quarter of 1999.

     sale to CompUSA Inc. on August 31, 1998.
(2)  Earnings used in computing  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  consist

     financing costs and a portion of rental charges.  Pre-tax earnings were not
     sufficient  to cover  fixed  charges  during 1996 by  approximately  $145.6
     million. Excluding $230.3 million (net of taxes) in restructuring and other
     charges, the 1996 ratio of earnings to fixed charges would have been 2.57.
(3)  Includes capital leases and TESOP indebtedness.
(4)  Total debt includes capital leases and TESOP  indebtedness.  Capitalization
     is defined as total debt plus total stockholders' equity.
(5)  Excluding $5.9 million (net of taxes) provision related to restricted stock
     awards in 1999,  return on  average  stockholders'  equity  would have been
     33.1%.
(6)  Excluding  $183.9  million  (net  of  taxes)  for  provisions   related  to
     restricted  stock  awards  and loss on sale of  Computer  City,  as well as
     Computer  City  operating  losses and other  business  writedowns  in 1998,
     return on average stockholders' equity would have been 23.6%.
(7)  Excluding $230.3 million (net of taxes) in restructuring  and other charges
     in 1996, return on average stockholders' equity would have been 8.9%.

    economy in general;
o   the inability to successfully implement, market and execute the
    RadioShack.comSM  website and its coordination with RadioShack retail
    outlets;
o   the presence or absence of new services or products and product  features in
    the  merchandise  categories  RadioShack  sells and changes in  RadioShack's
    actual merchandise sales mix;
o   the inability to negotiate  profitable  contracts or execute  business plans
    with   providers  of  such   services  as  cellular   and  PCS   telephones,
    direct-to-home satellite, Internet access and high-speed bandwidth;
o   the inability to collect the level of anticipated residual revenues,
    commissions and bounties for products and services sold by RadioShack;
o   the inability to successfully implement and execute Tandy's strategic
    alliances with Thomson Multimedia and/or Microsoft Corporation;
o   lack of  availability  or access to sources of supply  inventory (as a large
    importer  of  consumer  electronic  products  from Asia,  unfavorable  trade
    imbalances could negatively affect Tandy);
o   the inability to retain and grow an effective  management  team in a dynamic
    environment or changes in the cost or  availability of a suitable work force
    to manage and support Tandy's service-driven operating strategies;
o   the imposition of new restrictions or regulations regarding the sale of
    products and/or services Tandy sells or changes in tax rules and regulations
    applicable to Tandy;
o   the  inability  to  successfully  coordinate  AmeriLink Corporation and  its
    operations  with  RadioShack;  or
o   the adoption rate and market demand for high speed Internet and other
    Internet-related services.

The  United  States  retail  industry  and  the  specialty  retail  industry  in
particular are dynamic by nature and have undergone significant changes over the
past several years.  Tandy's ability to anticipate and  successfully  respond to
continuing challenges is key to achieving its expectations.

STOCK SPLIT
On May 20, 1999,  Tandy's  Board of Directors  declared a  two-for-one  split of
Tandy common stock,  payable on June 21, 1999.  All  references to the number of
shares (other than common stock issued or outstanding  on the 1998  Consolidated
Balance Sheet and the 1997 and 1998  Consolidated  Statements  of  Stockholders'
Equity),  per share amounts,  cash dividends and any other  reference to shares,
unless otherwise noted, have been adjusted to reflect the split on a retroactive
basis.  Previously awarded stock options,  restricted stock awards and all other
agreements payable in Tandy's common stock have also been adjusted or amended to
reflect the split.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1999 COMPARED WITH 1998
- -----------------------

NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES

Consolidated  net sales and  operating  revenues  decreased  13.8% from $4,787.9
million in 1998 to $4,126.2  million in 1999;  this  decrease  was  attributable
primarily  to the  sale  of  Computer  City  to  CompUSA  on  August  31,  1998.
Consolidated  comparable  store sales for 1999 are not  meaningful,  due to this
sale.

RadioShack Segment

RadioShack had an outstanding  year with  RadioShack's  overall sales increasing
14.9% to $4,126.2  million in 1999 from $3,591.2  million in 1998, due primarily
to a 12.2% comparable  company-owned  store sales gain and the opening of 48 new
stores,  net of store  closures.  Additionally,  sales to  RadioShack's  dealers
experienced  strong growth  throughout the year.  RadioShack's  comparable store
sales  increase  was  driven  primarily  by  increased  sales of  communications
products, prepaid wireless airtime and sales of audio and video equipment, which
includes  "direct-to-home"  satellite systems and services ("DTH").  A continued
healthy economy and a strong retail consumer  electronics  industry are expected
to result in a positive  comparable  store  sales gain for 2000.  The  following
table  summarizes  RadioShack's  retail sales breakdown by class of products and
each class as a percent of total  RadioShack  retail  sales  (excluding  outside
sales from retail support operations):

For the  first  time,  the  communications  category,  which  includes  wireless
communications  such as  cellular  and PCS  telephones,  as well as  residential
telephones,   answering  machines,   pagers  and  other  related  telephony  and
communication  products,   surpassed  the  electronic  parts,   accessories  and
specialty  equipment  category as  RadioShack's  largest product  category.  The
communications  category  increased,  as a  percentage  of total retail sales in
1999,  primarily  due to a 50%  increase  in  unit  sales  of PCS  and  cellular
telephones.  Both  unit and  dollar  sales of PCS and  cellular  telephones  are
expected  to  continue  to  increase  in  2000.  Through  The  Sprint  Store  at
RadioShack,  customers are provided with access to a full service communications
center that offers,  where available,  Sprint local and long-distance  telephone
service,   Spree(SM)   prepaid  phone  cards  and  Sprint  branded   residential
telephones.  On October 5, 1999,  Sprint  announced it would be merging with MCI
WorldCom,  Inc., subject to stockholder and regulatory approvals.  The merger is
expected to close in the second half of 2000. Tandy's management  anticipates no
significant  changes  to its  existing  agreements  as a result  of the  pending
merger.

Sales of electronic parts,  accessories and specialty  equipment  decreased as a
percentage  of total  retail sales in 1999 when  compared to 1998,  despite a 4%
sales gain.  The  category was 27.2% of  RadioShack's  retail sales mix in 1999,
down from 30.0% in 1998,  primarily due to the  communications  category and the
services  and other  category  becoming a higher  percent of the  product mix in
1999.  This  category  is  expected  to  increase  in sales,  but  decrease as a
percentage of RadioShack's retail sales mix in 2000 as the communications, audio
and video, and services and other categories increase.

The audio and video category  experienced a sales increase of approximately  27%
during 1999 when compared to 1998,  due primarily to a strong  increase in sales
of DTH.  Sales of DTH are  expected to continue to increase in 2000.  On May 13,
1999,  Tandy entered into a multi-year  retail sales and service  agreement with
Thomson Multimedia ("Thomson"),  which owns the RCA brand. Under this agreement,
Thomson  will  supply  RadioShack  with  various  RCA-branded  audio  and  video
components  such as  televisions,  VCRs,  camcorders,  digital  video disc (DVD)
players,  digital  cameras,  CD shelf  systems and other  digital  entertainment
products  beginning  in 2000.  Some of these items are  currently  available  in
stores.   The  expanded   assortment  will  be  sold  through  The  RCA  Digital
Entertainment Center at RadioShack via a "store-within-a-store"  concept with an
expected   rollout   date  in   mid-2000.   Store   fixture   costs   for   this
"store-within-a-store"  will be borne by Thomson.  Management believes that this
alliance  will allow  RadioShack  to be more  competitive  in the  evolution  of
digital  technology,  which should enhance sales in the audio and video category
in 2000 and beyond.

Personal  electronics  and seasonal  products  decreased to 9.4% of RadioShack's
retail sales mix in 1999 from 10.4% in 1998,  due  primarily to an overall shift
in the product mix as mentioned  above.  This  category  experienced  a 4% sales
increase over the prior year as a result of increased sales of toys, portable CD
players and radios.

Sales of personal  computers and peripherals  were 8.7% of  RadioShack's  retail
sales in 1999,  compared  to 9.1% in 1998,  despite a large  unit gain and a 10%
sales gain for the year.  The average  selling price of CPU's  decreased 16%, in
line with the general  market  decline.  The average  selling  price of CPU's is
expected to decrease slightly in 2000.  Despite this downward trend,  management
believes  that  the  higher  unit  sales  volumes  of  personal   computers  and
peripherals  will contribute to increased sales of this category,  as well as to
sales of higher gross margin  products and  services,  such as  accessories  and
extended service plans.

Sales in the services and other  category,  which includes  residuals and income
from prepaid wireless airtime,  repair services and extended service  contracts,
increased in 1999 in dollars and as a percent of RadioShack retail sales, due to
an  increase in sales of prepaid  wireless  airtime as well as to an increase in
residual   income   received  from   RadioShack's   third  party   providers  of
communications  and DTH.  Residual income is also earned on sales of Sprint long
distance  and PCS  services  as well as  sales of other  wireless  products  and
services. Residuals vary by service provider, but are typically a portion of the
continuing  service  revenue paid by the consumer  throughout the ensuing months
and/or  years  of that  customer's  subscription.  In  1999,  RadioShack  earned
approximately  $63.0  million of residual  income,  compared to $34.2 million in
1998.  Residual  income is expected  to  continue to increase in 2000;  however,
increases  are  dependent  upon such factors as  customers'  continued  usage of
certain  services and stability of average revenue per  subscriber,  among other
factors.  Prepaid  wireless  airtime  sales are  expected  to  decrease in 2000.
RadioShack  installation  service revenue is expected to increase in 2000 due to
the AmeriLink acquisition.

Connectivity  Strategy  Update:  Tandy entered into two  agreements  during 1999
which  management  believes are  significant  steps  towards  achieving  Tandy's
strategic plan for RadioShack to become  "America's  Home  Connectivity  Store,"
similar to its existing  concept of "America's  Telephone  Store."  Connectivity
will provide  solutions for  connecting to and utilizing  high-speed  bandwidth.
Bandwidth  refers to volume at which data can be transmitted  and,  depending on
the volume delivered,  may enable consumers to have such capabilities as instant
and/or  high speed  Internet  access,  movies on demand and  multiple  phone/fax
connections through a single phone or cable line.

On November 11, 1999, Tandy Corporation announced a five-year strategic alliance
with  Microsoft   Corporation   ("Microsoft")  that  encompasses  broadband  and
narrowband  technology,  as well as in-store  and online  efforts.  In the third
quarter of 2000,  RadioShack  and Microsoft are expected to launch The Microsoft
Internet Center @ RadioShack via a "store-within-a-store"  concept in as many as
5,000 company-owned RadioShack stores and participating dealer/franchise outlets
nationwide. Store fixture costs for this "store-within-a-store" will be borne by
Microsoft.  The Microsoft  Internet  Center @ RadioShack will allow customers to
view  demonstrations  of narrowband  and broadband  technology  and subscribe to
MSN(TM) dial-up or broadband  Internet  access service,  as well as view a broad
range of existing and future products, solutions and services based on Microsoft
technologies. RadioShack will receive a "bounty" on certain sales of Microsoft's
MSN broadband and  narrowband  Internet  access  service sold through its retail
outlets or through its  RadioShack.com  website.  Additionally,  RadioShack will
earn a residual based on a portion of the continuing service revenue paid by the
consumer   throughout   the  ensuing  months  and/or  years  of  the  customer's
subscription  to  MSN.  The  timing  of the  commencement  of the  residuals  is
dependent upon the marketing  program under which new  customers'  subscriptions
are  acquired.   See  also  "RadioShack.com,   LLC"  below  for  information  on
Microsoft's investment in RadioShack.com.

On April 21, 1999,  Tandy  announced  it had entered into a strategic  agreement
with  NorthPoint  Communications,  Inc.  ("NorthPoint"),  a provider  of Digital
Subscriber Line ("DSL") technology.  DSL technology transports data at speeds up
to 25 times faster than common dial-up modems,  allowing for high-speed Internet
access  and  other  data-intensive  applications.  Management  anticipates  this
alliance will  accelerate  the adoption rate of these  services at an affordable
price to the mass market. Additionally,  NorthPoint will provide RadioShack with
DSL services for consumer display purposes in many of its retail stores, as well
as for internal use. NorthPoint currently operates in 33 markets in the U.S. and
expects to expand its service territory to 60 markets by the end of 2000.

Also,  on July 30, 1999,  Tandy  acquired  AmeriLink,  one of America's  leading
installers  of cable,  telephony and  high-bandwidth  products.  See  "AmeriLink
Acquisition" below for further information.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit for Tandy was $2,083.5  million or 50.5% of net sales and operating
revenues,  compared  with  $2,004.4  million or 41.9% of net sales and operating
revenues in 1998. This increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and
operating  revenues was primarily the result of RadioShack  sales accounting for
all of the Company's consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 1999, when
compared to 1998 due to the sale of Computer City to CompUSA on August 31, 1998.
Computer City had an inherently lower gross margin  percentage than consolidated
Tandy  Corporation.  Without  Computer  City and  other  closed  units,  Tandy's
consolidated gross profit as a percent of net sales and operating revenues would
have been 52.1% for 1998.

RadioShack's gross profit increased 11.4% in dollars for the year ended December
31, 1999 versus 1998, but decreased as a percentage of RadioShack's  total sales
from 52.1% of sales in 1998 to 50.5% in 1999. This 1.6 percentage point decrease
was due primarily to mix shifts within  RadioShack's  product offerings as sales
of lower margin  categories  increased as a portion of the overall sales volume.
To a lesser extent,  the decrease in the gross margin percentage was also due to
promotional  markdowns of private  label audio and video  products as RadioShack
began  transitioning  to RCA-branded  products in the fourth quarter of 1999, as
well as to markdowns taken  throughout the year on residential  telephones.  The
decrease in gross margin was partially  offset by an increase in residual income
which has 100% gross margin.  Gross profit as a percentage of RadioShack's sales
is  expected to decrease in 2000,  although  not to the extent it  decreased  in
1999, due to continuing mix shifts within  RadioShack's  product  offerings.  An
expected  increase in residual income should partially offset this decrease.  In
addition, management expects to increase gross margin dollars and gain operating
leverage in selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses.

</TABLE>

Tandy's SG&A expense decreased  slightly in dollars,  but increased as a percent
of net sales and  operating  revenues to 36.0% for the year ended  December  31,
1999  versus  33.0% for the year  ended  December  31,  1998.  The  higher  SG&A
percentage  in 1999 was due  primarily  to the 1998 sale of Computer  City which
operated  at  lower  relative  SG&A  expense  levels  than  consolidated   Tandy
Corporation.  Excluding  Computer  City and other  closed  units,  Tandy's  SG&A
expense as a percentage  of sales would have  approximated  37.7% in 1998.  This
decrease of 1.7  percentage  points from 1998 was due primarily to the favorable
effect of increased sales at RadioShack during 1999.

Despite  the sale of Computer  City in 1998,  payroll  expense for  consolidated
Tandy Corporation increased in dollars and as a percent of Tandy's net sales and
operating revenues to 18.0% in 1999,  compared to 15.3% in 1998. Payroll expense
for  RadioShack  increased  to $99.1  million  in 1999  compared  to 1998.  This
increase was due primarily to  RadioShack  retail store  expansions,  changes in
compensation  plans and increases in personnel,  commissions,  bonuses and other
incentives  resulting  from  RadioShack's  strong  comparable  store  sales  and
profits.  The increase as a percentage of  RadioShack's  net sales and operating
revenues to 16.2% in 1999, compared to 15.8% in 1998, was also due to changes in
compensation plans, increases in personnel and other incentives.

Rent expense for consolidated  Tandy  Corporation  decreased in dollars in 1999,
but increased as a percent of Tandy's net sales and  operating  revenues to 5.0%
in 1999  from  4.5% in 1998.  The  decrease  in  dollars  was due to the sale of
Computer  City in 1998.  The  percentage  increase  also  related to the sale of
Computer  City,  which had lower  rent  expense  as a  percentage  of sales than
consolidated  Tandy  Corporation.  Rent  expense  for  RadioShack  increased  in
dollars,  but decreased as a percentage of RadioShack's  net sales and operating
revenues in 1999 compared to 1998. Rent expense increased $20.5 million in 1999,
compared to 1998,  due primarily to 48 new  RadioShack  store  openings,  net of
store  closures,  throughout  the year,  as well as lease  renewals  at slightly
higher  rates.  The  decrease  as a  percentage  of  RadioShack's  net sales and
operating  revenues to 5.2% in 1999,  compared to 5.4% in 1998 was due primarily
to the favorable effect of increased  comparable  RadioShack stores sales on the
expense rate structure.

Advertising expense for consolidated Tandy Corporation decreased in dollars, but
increased  as a percent of Tandy's net sales and  operating  revenues to 4.8% in
1999, compared to 4.4% in 1998, due to the sale of Computer City in August 1998.
Advertising expense for RadioShack decreased in both dollars and as a percentage
of RadioShack's  net sales and operating  revenues to $198.1 million and 4.8% of
sales in 1999,  compared to $200.2 million and 5.6% of sales in 1998. The dollar
decrease was due primarily to increased  marketing  development  funds  received
from service providers.  In addition,  the decrease as a percentage of sales and
operating  revenues reflects the sales leverage gained from  RadioShack's  sales
increase.

Credit card fees expense,  which includes fees  associated with third party bank
credit cards and fees paid for  promotional  accounts such as "zero interest for
six months," and the "other"  expense  category  both  decreased  primarily as a
result of the sale of Computer City.

In 2000,  Tandy's  SG&A  expense is  expected  to  increase  in  dollars  due to
additional sales volume, but decrease as a percentage of net sales and operating
revenues as a result of the sales leverage gained from a comparable  store sales
increase and, to a lesser extent, an increase in new stores.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

On  February  1, 1998,  Tandy  granted,  under the 1997  Incentive  Stock  Plan,
approximately  649,500  restricted stock awards consisting of 500 shares each to
1,299  RadioShack store managers not included in the February 1, 1997 restricted
stock grant.  The February 1998 restricted  stock awards had a weighted  average
fair market value of $19.61 per share when granted.  This restricted stock grant
was to vest on February 2, 2003, if managers  receiving the grants were employed
by Tandy at a store  manager  or higher  position,  at that time.  However,  the
grants  provided  that the  restricted  shares  would vest early if Tandy common
stock closed at $29.0625 or more for any 20  consecutive  trading days beginning
February 1, 2000. At December 31, 1999, it was probable that the 348,000  shares
that  remained  outstanding  under this grant would vest under the early vesting
provisions.  The  resulting  charge to  compensation  expense of $14.7  million,
including related payroll taxes, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999.

Vesting of these  restricted  stock awards  occurred  when Tandy's  common stock
closed above the targeted  amount for the twentieth  consecutive  trading day on
February 29, 2000. Vesting resulted in the issuance of 336,000 shares of Tandy's
common stock at a fair market value of $37.53 per share.

In the fourth quarter of 1998, Tandy recorded estimated  compensation expense of
$82.6 million  related to the early vesting of restricted  stock awards that had
been granted to 4,907 store managers on February 1, 1997. These awards vested on
March 1, 1999 and the actual price of the stock and the number of shares  vested
differed  from the  estimated  accrual at December 31, 1998.  The amount of this
difference,  $5.1  million,  was  recorded  as a credit to  expense in the first
quarter of 1999.

The restricted stock program for store managers was replaced in 1999 and 2000 by
a stock  option  program for store  managers.  See Note 19 - "Stock  Options and
Performance Awards" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ("Notes").
Management  does not  anticipate  any future use of  restricted  stock for store
managers.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $16.8  million for 1999 versus
$34.6 million for 1998.

Interest expense decreased 18.1% to $37.2 million in 1999, from $45.4 million in
1998.  This  decrease was a result of Tandy no longer  having to incur  interest
expense  on  Computer  City  capital  lease   obligations,   as  well  as  to  a
corresponding decrease in Tandy's average debt outstanding during 1999. Interest
income  increased almost 90% in 1999 to $20.4 million in 1999 from $10.8 million
in 1998,  due  primarily  to  interest  from the  $136.0  million  CompUSA  note
receivable  which was outstanding a full year (see "Sale of Computer City, Inc."
below for further information).

Interest  expense,  net of interest income, is expected to increase during 2000,
primarily due to anticipated higher short-term interest rates and increased debt
from additional share repurchases.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes  reflects an effective tax rate of 38.0% for 1999
compared with 38.5% for 1998.  This decrease  resulted  primarily  from improved
utilization  of foreign tax credits and  implementation  of certain state income
tax initiatives.

1998 COMPARED WITH 1997
- -----------------------

NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES

Consolidated  net sales and  operating  revenues  decreased  10.9% from $5,372.2
million in 1997 to $4,787.9  million in 1998;  this  decrease  was  attributable
primarily  to the  sale  of  Computer  City  to  CompUSA  on  August  31,  1998.
Consolidated  comparable  store sales for 1998 were not meaningful,  due to this
sale.

RadioShack Segment
- ------------------

Sales for the RadioShack segment in 1998 increased 8.7% to $3,591.2 million from
$3,303.9  million in 1997, due primarily to a 7.4%  comparable  store sales gain
and the opening of 48 new stores, net of store closures. RadioShack's comparable
store  sales  increase  was driven  primarily  by  increased  sales of  wireless
communication and telephony products and services.

Electronic  parts,  accessories  and specialty  equipment,  the largest  product
category of  RadioShack's  retail sales mix in 1998,  decreased  1.5  percentage
points in 1998 when  compared to 1997,  despite a 4.1% increase in dollar sales.
This   decrease  as  a  percent  of  retail  sales  was  primarily  due  to  the
communications  and the services and other categories  becoming a higher percent
of the product mix in 1998. The  communications  category  increased to 28.5% of
retail sales in 1998 from 27.5% in 1997. Dollar sales in this category increased
13.2% over 1997 as the  category  continued  to benefit from The Sprint Store at
RadioShack  launched  in  September  1997.  Sales of audio  and  video  products
declined  to 15.5% of retail  sales in 1998 from 16.8% of retail  sales in 1997,
primarily  due to the overall  shift in the product  mix to  communications  and
services. Sales dollars in the audio and video category were flat from the prior
year, due in part to RadioShack's limited selection of name brand products.  The
audio and video  category  also  included  DTH  sales,  which  included  digital
satellite  systems (DSS) and Primestar  satellite  television  services in 1998.
Sales of these systems and services increased  significantly over 1997. Personal
electronics and seasonal products  decreased to 10.4% of RadioShack retail sales
in 1998 from 11.6% in 1997, due primarily to an overall shift in the product mix
to  communications  and services.  The sales  decrease in this category was also
attributable to sales declines in such items as boomboxes, cassette products and
toys,  other than remote control cars, due to lower general  consumer demand for
these products.

The personal computer  category  decreased to 9.1% of RadioShack retail sales in
1998 from 9.4% in 1997, despite a large unit gain and a 5.8% sales gain for this
category for 1998. RadioShack computers experienced a 32% decline in the average
1998 selling price of desktop  computers  from the 1997 annual  average  selling
price.  Aggressive pricing strategies put into place as RadioShack  transitioned
from IBM to Compaq branded computers and products during the first six months of
1998 and general  selling  price  declines  in the  personal  computer  industry
contributed to this decline.  Sales in the services and other category increased
in 1998 in  dollars  and as a percent  of  RadioShack  retail  sales,  due to an
increase in residual income received from RadioShack's  third party providers of
communication  and DTH,  as well as to a large  increase  in  sales  of  prepaid
wireless  airtime.  In 1998,  RadioShack earned  approximately  $34.2 million of
residual income, compared to $7.9 million in 1997.

Computer City Segment
- ---------------------

Computer City's overall sales  decreased 37.1% to $1,196.7  million in 1998 from
1997, due to the sale of this  subsidiary to CompUSA on August 31, 1998. For the
eight months ended August 31,  1998,  sales of personal  computers  decreased in
dollars due to a reduction of approximately  25% in the average selling price of
desktop and notebook computers from the same period in 1997. Additionally,  both
overall and comparable  stores sales were  negatively  impacted by the announced
sale of Computer  City to CompUSA on June 22, 1998,  at which time Computer City
took  promotional  mark-downs  to sell both its  third-party  and  private-label
inventory in preparation  for the sale to CompUSA.  (See "Sale of Computer City,
Inc." below.)

GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit for Tandy was $2,004.4  million or 41.9% of net sales and operating
revenues  in 1998,  compared  with  $2,014.3  million  or 37.5%,  in 1997.  This
increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues was
primarily  the result of RadioShack  sales  accounting  for a larger  portion of
Tandy's  consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 1998, when compared to
1997, due to the sale of Computer City to CompUSA in August 1998.  Computer City
had an inherently lower gross margin than consolidated Tandy Corporation.

RadioShack's  gross  profit  increased  in  dollars  in 1998  versus  1997,  but
decreased as a percentage of RadioShack's  total sales by 0.6 percentage  points
over the same period.  This  percentage  decrease was  primarily  due to a shift
within  RadioShack's  product  offerings to increased sales of prepaid  wireless
airtime,  which  has  a  significantly  lower  gross  margin  than  the  overall
RadioShack  average  gross  margin.  This  decrease was  partially  offset by an
increase in residual income, which has close to 100% gross margin.

Computer  City's  gross  profit  as a  percent  of  Computer  City net sales and
operating  revenues  decreased  2.3  percentage  points in 1998 when compared to
1997.  This decrease was  primarily  due to  aggressive  marketing of inventory,
especially  private-label branded inventory,  in preparation for the sale of the
subsidiary.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

Tandy's  SG&A  expense was flat in dollars,  but  increased  as a percent of net
sales and operating  revenues to 33.0% in 1998 versus 29.4% in 1997.  The higher
SG&A percentage was due primarily to RadioShack  becoming a larger percentage of
Tandy's  consolidated   operations  during  1998  (see  "Gross  Profit"  above).
RadioShack  operates at higher  relative SG&A expense  levels than  consolidated
Tandy Corporation.  Excluding Computer City and closed units associated with the
1996  restructuring  plan, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales would have been
37.7% in 1998 versus 38.9% in 1997. Although payroll and commissions expense for
1998 remained flat in dollars in comparison  with 1997, this cost increased as a
percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues from 13.7% in 1997 to 15.3% in
1998,  due in part to the increase in RadioShack  sales as a percentage of total
Company  sales and  operating  revenues,  as  described  above.  RadioShack  has
inherently  higher  salary  expense as a percentage  of sales,  when compared to
consolidated  Tandy  Corporation.  To  a  lesser  extent,  payroll  expense  was
negatively    impacted    by    higher    payroll    costs    associated    with
infrastructure-building  at CCI,  prior  to its  announced  sale  in June  1998.
Advertising  expense  increased both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales
and  operating  revenues in 1998,  as compared to 1997.  This  increase over the
prior  year is  primarily  attributable  to  increased  advertising  expense  at
Computer City in 1998, compared to 1997. Somewhat offsetting this increase was a
dollar decrease in advertising expense at RadioShack in 1998 from 1997. In 1997,
however,  the  marketing  launch of the Sprint Store at  RadioShack  resulted in
increased  advertising  expense for that year. Rent expense decreased in dollars
in comparison with 1997 and increased  slightly as a percentage of net sales and
operating  revenues to 4.5% in 1998 from 4.1% in 1997. This increase was related
to the sale of Computer  City,  which had lower rent expense as a percentage  of
sales  than  consolidated  Tandy  Corporation.   Rent  expense  in  dollars  for
RadioShack  increased in 1998 compared to the prior year, but decreased slightly
as a percent of sales.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

On February 1, 1997,  in an effort to reduce the  turnover  rate among its store
managers and to align the store managers'  interests and goals with those of the
shareholders,  Tandy  granted,  under  the  1993  ISP,  approximately  4,082,400
restricted stock awards  consisting of 800 shares each to 4,907 RadioShack store
managers  and  1,600  shares  each  to 98  Computer  City  store  managers.  The
restricted  stock awards had a weighted  average fair market value of $11.30 per
share when granted.  This restricted  stock was to vest at the end of five years
on February 2, 2002, if managers  receiving the grants were employed by Tandy at
a store manager or higher position,  at that time. However,  the grants provided
that the  restricted  shares would vest early if Tandy's  common stock closed at
$16.90625  or more for any 20  consecutive  trading days  beginning  February 1,
1999.  At December 31,  1998,  it was probable  that the  2,579,200  shares that
remained  outstanding  under  this  grant  would  vest  under the early  vesting
provisions.  The  resulting  charge to  compensation  expense of $82.6  million,
including related payroll taxes, was recorded in the December 31, 1998 financial
statements. The awards vested on March 1, 1999 and the actual price of the stock
and the number of shares  vested  differed  slightly from  estimated  accrual at
December 31, 1998.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $34.6  million for 1998 versus
$32.9 million for 1997.  Interest expense decreased slightly during 1998, due to
a corresponding decrease in Tandy's average debt outstanding during 1998 as well
as to a small decrease in short-term interest rates for the year.

Interest  income  decreased in 1998 due to the repayment of the  InterTAN,  Inc.
("InterTAN")  note receivable on December 31, 1997,  offset by interest received
on the note receivable from CompUSA for $136.0 million. Interest income relating
to  Fry's  Electronics,  Inc.  and its  affiliates  ("Fry's)  notes  receivables
resulted from the 1997 sale of assets and real estate of six Incredible Universe
stores.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 38.5% for both
1998 and 1997.

AMERILINK ACQUISITION
On July 30, 1999, Tandy acquired AmeriLink in an all stock transaction valued at
approximately $75.8 million. Tandy exchanged approximately 1.8 million shares of
Tandy common stock for all of the  outstanding  common stock of  AmeriLink.  The
transaction  was  accounted  for under the purchase  method of  accounting.  The
purchase  price was  allocated to the assets  acquired and  liabilities  assumed
based on their  estimated  fair  values  at the date of the  acquisition,  which
resulted in  approximately  $50.7  million of goodwill  being  recorded in other
assets in the  accompanying  1999  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  The associated
goodwill  will be  amortized  over 20 years.  AmeriLink  designs,  installs  and
maintains  cabling  systems  for the  transmission  of  video,  voice  and data,
primarily for home use.  AmeriLink  will  continue to provide these  services to
outside  parties  and  also  to  RadioShack,   through  AmeriLink's   RadioShack
Installation  Services  Division.  Services for  RadioShack in 2000 will consist
primarily of customer DIRECTV installations;  however, new services such as home
theater  and  broadband  Internet  access,   among  others,  will  be  added  as
RadioShack's needs dictate. At February 25, 2000, AmeriLink had 76 field offices
located in 26 states.

RADIOSHACK.COM, LLC
In   October   1999,   Tandy   launched   its   e-commerce    enabled   website,
www.RadioShack.com.  On November 10, 1999,  Tandy and Microsoft formed a limited
liability company, RadioShack.com, LLC ("RS.com"), for the purpose of  marketing
and selling electronics  products on the Internet.  Tandy contributed assets and
also extended a royalty-free license for certain trademarks and service marks to
RS.com, and  Microsoft  contributed  cash of $100.0  million on January 4, 2000.
Tandy owns 100% of the common units of RS.com,  while Microsoft owns 100% of the
preferred  units and Tandy will  include  RS.com in its  consolidated  financial
statements.  Tandy is  entitled  to  receive  75% of the  profits  and losses of
RS.com,  while  Microsoft will receive 25%;  however,  the preferred  units have
liquidation  rights  which  could  impact the  allocation  of profits and losses
between the unit holders.  The preferred units are convertible into common units
at any time and must be converted in the event of certain capital  transactions.
In certain circumstances,  Microsoft has the option to require Tandy to purchase
its units and Tandy has the right to purchase  Microsoft's  units.  Also, in the
event of liquidation,  the preferred units have  preferential  rights to recover
their initial investment.

During 2000,  RadioShack and Microsoft will jointly  redesign and reengineer the
www.RadioShack.com  website,  incorporating  current Microsoft  technology.  The
planned result will be a  full-featured  online  e-commerce site where customers
can go for a wide range of electronics products, parts and services. Among other
features,  customers will have the ability to obtain answers to frequently asked
questions on electronics through  www.RadioShack.com's  "Ask the Shack" feature,
as well as the ability to  download  instruction  manuals and service  documents
relating to electronics products. Management anticipates that the newly designed
website will be  relaunched  during the third  quarter of 2000,  and it believes
that  www.RadioShack.com  will become a premier destination site for electronics
products,  services,  information,   answers  and  solutions  for  consumer  and
commercial  customers.  As of March 1, 2000,  there were over  20,000  different
products on the website.

Additionally, Microsoft will provide www.RadioShack.com premier placement across
the  MSN(TM)  network,  Microsoft's  Internet  access  service,  and its  online
properties,  including the  newly-launched MSN eShop(TM) online shopping service
site (http://eshop.msn.com/).  Through its presence on eShop, www.RadioShack.com
will be able to take advantage of the portal  leadership of MSN to reach a broad
audience of customers on the Internet.

SALE OF COMPUTER CITY, INC.
On August 31, 1998,  Tandy completed the sale of 100% of the outstanding  common
stock of its Computer City, Inc. subsidiary to CompUSA Inc. In the third quarter
of 1998,  Tandy  received  approximately  $75.0 million in cash and an unsecured
subordinated  note for $136.0 million as consideration  for the sale. The amount
of cash to be retained was subject to  adjustment  and in the fourth  quarter of
1998 the amount of cash  consideration  was reduced to $36.5  million.  The note
bears  interest  at 9.48%  per  annum  and is  payable  over a ten year  period.
Interest is payable on June 30 and December 31 of each year;  the first  payment
was made on December  31,  1998.  Beginning  on  December  31,  2001,  principal
payments will be due semiannually until the note matures on June 30, 2008. Tandy
recognized  a loss of  $108.2  million  from the sale of  Computer  City,  which
included certain liabilities and contractual obligations incurred by Tandy.

Computer City's results from operations  through August 31, 1998 are included in
the accompanying  Consolidated  Financial Statements.  Below is a summary of net
sales and operating  revenues and net losses  (unaudited)  for Computer City for
each year ended December 31:

     August 31, 1998.

On March 1, 2000, Grupo Sanborns,  S.A. de C.V. ("Sanborns") and TPC Acquisition
Corporation,  a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanborns,  acquired CompUSA.  Tandy's
management does not believe that this acquisition will have a negative impact on
CompUSA's ability to repay its obligation to Tandy.

1996 BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING
In the fourth quarter of 1996, Tandy initiated  certain  restructuring  programs
resulting from the highly competitive environment in the electronics industry at
the time. In conjunction  with these programs,  in January 1997, Tandy closed 53
McDuff  stores and 21  unprofitable  Computer City stores.  Additionally,  Tandy
either closed or sold all of its  Incredible  Universe  stores during 1997.  The
components  of the  restructuring  charge and an  analysis of the  reserves  are
outlined  in a table in Note 7 - "1996  Business  Restructuring"  of the  Notes.
Below is a summary of net sales and  operating  revenues  and  operating  losses

TAX SHARING AND TAX BENEFIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
Under  Tandy's  Tax  Sharing  and  Tax  Benefit  Reimbursement   Agreement  (the
"Agreement") with O'Sullivan Industries  ("O'Sullivan"),  a former subsidiary of
Tandy,  Tandy receives  payments from O'Sullivan  approximating  the federal tax
benefit that  O'Sullivan  realizes  from the  increased  tax basis of its assets
resulting  from the initial  public  offering  completed in February  1994.  The
higher tax basis increases O'Sullivan's tax deductions and, accordingly, reduces
income taxes payable by O'Sullivan.  For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998
and  1997,  Tandy  recognized  income of $5.1  million,  $6.0  million  and $5.8
million, net of tax, respectively, under this Agreement. The Agreement calls for
payments to continue  to be made over a 15-year  time period and are  contingent
upon O'Sullivan's level of earnings from year to year. In November 1999, members
of O'Sullivan's  senior  management team, in conjunction with a financial buyer,
acquired all of O'Sullivan's outstanding common stock. The effect of this change
of control on the payments  Tandy will  receive is  currently  the subject of an
arbitration proceeding between Tandy and O'Sullivan. Depending on the outcome of
such  arbitration,  the amount of payments received under the Agreement could be
significantly  less than in prior years and/or the timing of such payments could
be delayed.

NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.
133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities." In June
1999,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 137 which delayed the effective date of SFAS No.
133 to quarters  beginning  after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires a company
to record all derivative  instruments at fair value on the balance sheet.  Tandy
does not use derivatives for speculative  purposes. As such, its market risk was
not material in 1999 and is not expected to be material in 2000.

CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY

                                  Year Ended December 31,
                              --------------------------------
(In millions)                   1999        1998        1997
- -------------                 --------    --------    --------
Operating activities          $  561.6    $  414.8    $  320.3
Investing activities            (121.0)      (93.0)      (63.9)
Financing activities            (340.5)     (363.2)     (272.0)

In 1999, cash flow provided by operating activities was $561.6 million, compared
to $414.8 million and $320.3 million in 1998 and 1997,  respectively.  Cash flow
from net income,  adjusted for non-cash items, increased $97.0 million from 1998
to 1999.  This  increase  was  primarily  due to increased  operating  profit at
RadioShack.  The  increase  in cash  flow  from  operating  activities  was also
positively  affected by a $49.8  million  increase in cash flow  generated  from
working capital improvements  primarily attributable to a $73.0 million increase
in accrued income taxes. During 1998, changes in working capital generated $55.2
million of cash flow  compared  to a use of cash of $72.4  million in 1997.  The
increase in 1998 was caused  primarily by the  liquidation of CCI's  inventories
prior to its sale in August 1998.

Investing  activities  used  $121.0  million in cash in 1999,  compared to $93.0
million in 1998 and $63.9  million in 1997.  Capital  expenditures  approximated
$102.4 million in 1999, compared to $131.5 million in 1998 and $118.4 million in
1997.  Capital  expenditures  for 1999 consisted  primarily of RadioShack  store
expansions  and  remodels,  upgrades  of  machinery  and  expansion  in selected
distribution centers and manufacturing facilities,  updated information systems,
including Year 2000 ("Y2K") initiatives, and web development for RadioShack.com.
Capital expenditures for 1998 and 1997 were used primarily for retail expansion,
upgrading  information  systems and Computer  City  infrastructure  enhancements
prior to the announced  sale of CCI in June 1998.  Management  anticipates  that
capital  expenditure  requirements for 2000 will  approximate  $120.0 million to
$125.0 million and will consist  primarily of RadioShack future store expansions
and remodels,  updated information  systems and, to a lesser extent,  expansions
and additions relating to Tandy's distribution and manufacturing facilities, web
development  for  RadioShack.com  and the purchase of vehicles  for  AmeriLink's
RadioShack  Installation  Services  Division.  In April 1999, Tandy made a $20.0
million  dollar  investment  in  NorthPoint.  Cash proceeds from the sale of CCI
generated  $36.5  million in cash in 1998.  Cash  proceeds in 1997 totaled $57.4
million  and  related  to the  sale of  various  corporate  assets  and  certain
Incredible  Universe  locations,  final  repayment of the note  receivable  from
InterTAN and the sale of Tandy's  remaining shares of AST Research,  Inc. common
stock.

Cash used by financing activities was $340.5 million in 1999, compared to $363.2
million and $272.0 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively. Purchases of treasury
stock  required cash of $422.2  million,  $337.4  million and $425.6  million in
1999,  1998 and  1997,  respectively.  (See  "Capital  Structure  and  Financial
Condition" below for further information on Tandy's stock repurchase  programs.)
The  1999,  1998 and 1997  stock  repurchases  were  partially  funded  by $81.5
million, $57.8 million and $50.7 million,  respectively,  received from the sale
of treasury  stock to Tandy's  employee  stock purchase plans and employee stock
option exercises. Dividends paid, net of tax, in 1999, 1998 and 1997 amounted to
$42.5 million,  $44.8 million and $48.2 million,  respectively.  The decrease in
dividends paid in 1999 and 1998 resulted from fewer outstanding  shares in those
years. On October 25, 1999, Tandy announced a 10% increase in the quarterly cash
dividend from $0.050 per share to $0.055 per share,  for  shareholders of record
on January 3, 2000.  Medium-term notes issued by Tandy under its 1997 Debt Shelf
Registration  Statement provided  approximately $101.0 and $45.0 million in cash
in 1999 and 1998, respectively,  the majority of which was used to repay current
maturities of long-term  debt. In 1999,  Tandy used excess cash flow to decrease
short-term  debt from the prior year by $42.3  million  and in 1998,  Tandy used
excess cash flow to decrease  its  short-term  debt from the prior year by $44.9
million.  Tandy ended 1999 with approximately  $100.0 million in additional cash
as part of its Y2K readiness  planning.  It is anticipated that cash balances in
the future will be less than $100.0 million.

The current credit ratings for Tandy, which are generally considered  investment
grade, follow:

                                           Standard       Duff &

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Tandy's  balance sheet and financial  condition  continue to be strong.  Tandy's
available borrowing facilities as of December 31, 1999 are detailed in Note 12 -
"Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities" of the Notes.

On  March 3,  1997,  Tandy  announced  that its  Board of  Directors  authorized
management to purchase up to 20.0 million  additional shares of its common stock
through Tandy's existing share repurchase program.  The share repurchase program
was initially  authorized in December 1995 and increased in October 1996 and was
undertaken  as a result of  management's  view of the economic  value of Tandy's
stock.  The  share  increase  for 1997  brought  the total  authorization  since
inception to 60.0 million  shares,  of which  approximately  56.7 million shares
totaling $949.2 million were repurchased as of December 31, 1999.  Approximately
4.8  million  shares  were  repurchased  in 1999 for  $203.4  million  under the
program.  An additional 1.6 million shares have been repurchased from January 1,
2000 to February 29, 2000 for $70.5 million.

Additionally,  on October 26, 1998,  Tandy announced that its Board of Directors
authorized  the  repurchase of up to 10.0 million shares of Tandy's common stock
for an  indefinite  period of time to be used to offset the  dilution  of grants
under  Tandy's  incentive  stock  plans  (see  Note  19  -  "Stock  Options  and
Performance  Awards"  of the  Notes).  Approximately  4.2  million  shares  were
repurchased in 1999 for $190.7 million,  bringing the total share  repurchase at
December  31, 1999 under this  program to 7.0  million  shares  totaling  $254.5
million.  An additional  1.9 million shares were  repurchased  for $93.7 million
from January 1, 2000 to February 29, 2000.

These purchases under the two share repurchase  programs  described above are in
addition to the shares  required for employee  stock purchase  plans,  which are
purchased throughout the year. Purchases will continue to be made in 2000 in the
open market with funding of the  programs  coming from excess free cash flow and
short-term borrowings, if needed.

In connection  with the share  repurchase  program,  the Board of Directors,  at
their October 23, 1998 meeting,  authorized management to sell up to 2.0 million
put options on Tandy common  stock.  Such put options  grant the  purchaser  the
right to sell shares of Tandy's  common stock to Tandy at specified  prices upon
exercise of the put options.  These put options are exercisable only at maturity
and can be settled in cash at Tandy's option, in lieu of repurchasing the stock.
The  issued put  options  have a maturity  of up to six  months.  Tandy has sold
approximately 1.4 million put options since the inception of the program and 0.4
million put options  remained  outstanding at December 31, 1999. The put options
expire on various dates  through April 2000. At December 31, 1999 and 1998,  the
full  redemption  value of the put options was  classified  as common  stock put
options in the accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheets. The related offset was
recorded in common stock in treasury, net of premiums received.

Additionally,  at their  February  23,  2000  meeting,  the  Board of  Directors
authorized  management to supplement the put option program with equity forwards
and increased the number of shares subject to put options and equity forwards to
4.6 million shares. The Board of Directors also extended the expiration date for
the program to no later than December 31, 2002. Put options and equity  forwards
will  continue to be executed  from time to time in order to take  advantage  of
attractive share price levels, as determined by management. The timing and terms
of the transactions,  including maturities, depend on market conditions, Tandy's
liquidity and other considerations.

Tandy's primary source of short-term  debt consists of short-term  seasonal bank
debt and commercial  paper,  which have  maturities of less than 90 days. In the
second  quarter of 1999,  Tandy extended the maturity date of its $200.0 million
364-day  revolving credit facility to June 2000. Tandy also has a $300.0 million
five-year  revolving  credit facility  maturing June 2003. The revolving  credit
facilities are used as backup for the  commercial  paper program and may also be
utilized  for  general  corporate  purposes.  Annual  commitment  fees  for  the
facilities are 0.07% of the $200.0 million  facility per annum and 0.085% of the
$300.0  million  facility per annum,  whether used or unused.  During the second
quarter of 2000, Tandy plans to extend the $200.0 million facility to June 2001.

The total  debt-to-capitalization ratio was 38.0% at December 31, 1999, 35.6% at
December  31,  1998 and 33.6% at  December  31,  1997.  These  increases  in the
debt-to-capitalization  ratios  result  primarily  from a  reduction  in Tandy's
stockholders'  equity  due to the share  repurchase  program  and the  impact of
divested businesses.

In May 1997,  Tandy filed a $300.0  million  Debt Shelf  Registration  Statement
("Shelf  Registration") with the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  which was
declared  effective in August 1997. In August 1997,  Tandy issued $150.0 million
of 10 year unsecured  notes under the Shelf  Registration.  The interest rate on
the notes is 6.95% per annum with interest payable on September 1 and March 1 of
each year,  commencing  March 1, 1998.  The notes are due  September 1, 2007. In
December  1997 and January  1998,  Tandy issued $4.0 million and $45.0  million,
respectively,  in  medium-term  notes under the remaining  $150.0  million Shelf
Registration.  An additional  $32.0 million,  $37.0 million and $32.0 million of
medium-term  notes were issued in January 1999,  August 1999 and September 1999,
respectively,  completing the remaining 1997 Shelf Registration.  Tandy's medium
and  long-term  notes  outstanding  at  December  31,  1999 under the 1997 Shelf
Registration  totaled $300.0 million,  compared to $199.0 million outstanding at
December 31, 1998. The interest  rates at December 31, 1999 for the  outstanding
$150.0 million in  medium-term  notes ranged from 6.09% to 7.35% with a weighted
average coupon rate of 6.6%.

Tandy's management  believes that its present borrowing capacity is greater than
the  established  credit  lines and  long-term  debt in place.  Management  also
believes that Tandy's cash flow from  operations,  cash and cash equivalents and
its available borrowing  facilities are more than adequate to fund planned store
and business  expansion,  to meet debt service and dividend  requirements and to
fund its share repurchase programs.

INFLATION
Inflation  has not  significantly  impacted  Tandy  over the past  three  years.
Management does not expect inflation to have a significant  impact on operations
in the foreseeable  future,  unless global situations  substantially  affect the
world economy.

YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE
Tandy's  management  recognized  the  importance of taking  necessary  action to
ensure that its operation and relationships with key vendors, service providers,
customers and other third  parties  would not be adversely  impacted by software
processing errors arising from calculations using the year 2000 and beyond. Like
many  companies,  a  significant  number of Tandy's  computer  applications  and
systems  required  modifications  in order for these systems to be ready for the
year 2000.

With its transition plans and teams in place, Tandy  successfully  completed its
Y2K rollover  without any major problems or disruptions.  All of Tandy's stores,
manufacturing  facilities,  logistics  operations,  service  centers and support
areas were fully functional  subsequent to the Y2K rollover.  Tandy is not aware
that  any of its  major  business  partners  experienced  material  Y2K  issues.
Additionally, to date, product returns and repairs at its retail stores have not
been  significant  and management  does not  anticipate any further  activity or
disruptions to occur on its part with respect to the Y2K rollover.

Tandy's total Y2K readiness costs were  approximately  $11.5 million,  including
$1.1 million paid to external parties for consulting and  professional  fees. Of
the total costs,  approximately $4.4 million were incurred in 1999. Tandy funded
both the capital and expensed  elements of resolving  Y2K issues  through  funds
generated  from  operations.  Tandy  does not  expect  to incur  any  additional
significant costs in 2000.

All statements concerning Y2K issues other than historical statements constitute
"forward-looking  statements," as defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation
Reform  Act  of  1995.  Such  forward-looking   statements  should  be  read  in
conjunction with Tandy's  disclosures under the heading "Factors That May Affect
Future Results."

ITEM 7a.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

In June  1998,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities".  In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137
which delayed the  effective  date of SFAS No. 133 to quarters  beginning  after
June 15,  2000.  SFAS No.  133  requires  a  company  to record  all  derivative
instruments at fair value on the balance sheet.  Tandy does not use  derivatives
for speculative purposes. As such, its market risk was not material in 1999.

All schedules have been omitted because they are not applicable, not required or
the information is included in the  consolidated  financial  statements or notes
thereto.

Separate  financial  statements of Tandy  Corporation  have been omitted because
Tandy is primarily an operating  company and the amount of restricted net assets
of  consolidated   and   unconsolidated   subsidiaries  and  Tandy's  equity  in
undistributed  earnings  of 50% or  less-owned  companies  accounted  for by the
equity method are not  significant.  All  subsidiaries of Tandy  Corporation are
included in the consolidated  financial statements.  Financial statements of 50%
or  less-owned  companies  have been  omitted  because  they do not,  considered
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a significant subsidiary.

                        Report of Independent Accountants



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Tandy Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index  on page 29  present  fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  financial
position of Tandy  Corporation and its subsidiaries  (the "Company") at December
31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with
accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States. These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management;   our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.  We conducted  our audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with
auditing standards  generally accepted in the United States,  which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial   statements,   assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tandy Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Tandy Corporation ("Tandy" or the "Company"),  through its 7,100 plus RadioShack
company-owned  and  dealer/franchise  outlets,  is the nation's largest consumer
electronics  chain.  RadioShack's sales and operating revenues relate to private
label and branded consumer electronics,  brand name personal computers, wireless
communication  products and services,  telephony and "direct-to-home"  satellite
systems. Additionally,  Tandy operates certain related retail support groups and
consumer electronics manufacturing businesses.

Another retail concept, Computer City, Inc. ("CCI" or "Computer City"), was sold
effective  August 31, 1998.  Computer  City sales  related to personal  computer
hardware and  software,  printers,  peripheral  equipment and  accessories  sold
through retail locations and direct sales to corporate, government and education
customers.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation:  The Consolidated  Financial Statements include the
accounts  of Tandy and its  majority  owned  subsidiaries.  CCI was  included in
Consolidated Financial Statements through August 31, 1998, the date of its sale.
Investments  in 20% to 50%  owned  companies  are  accounted  for on the  equity
method. Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Pervasiveness  of  Estimates:  The  preparation  of  financial  statements,   in
conformity with accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  related
revenues and expenses and the disclosure of gain and loss  contingencies  at the
date of the  financial  statements.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those
estimates.

Foreign  Currency  Translation:  The functional  currency of  substantially  all
operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency.  Translation gains
or losses related to net assets located outside the United States are shown as a
component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss and are  classified in the
equity section of the balance sheet.

Cash and Cash  Equivalents:  Cash on hand in stores,  deposits  in banks and all
highly liquid  investments with an original  maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase are considered cash and cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents
are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Marketable  Securities:  Marketable  securities  are marked to market based upon
market value fluctuations and resulting adjustments,  net of deferred taxes, are
reported as a component of stockholders' equity until realized. Declines in fair
market value that are  considered to be other than  temporary are  recognized in
earnings and  establish a new cost basis for the  security.  Realized  gains and
losses  are   included  in  earnings   and  are   determined   on  the  specific
identification  method.  In April 1999,  Tandy made an  investment in NorthPoint
Communications, Inc. ("NorthPoint") common stock. This investment is included in
other current assets in the accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheet at December
31, 1999 and is designated as  "securities  available for sale." At December 31,
1999, the fair value of Tandy's investment in NorthPoint was equal to its cost.

Accounts  Receivable  and  Allowance  For Doubtful  Accounts:  An allowance  for
doubtful  accounts is provided when accounts are determined to be uncollectible.
Concentrations  of credit risk with respect to customer  receivables are limited
due to the large number of customers  comprising Tandy's customer base and their
location in many different geographic areas of the country.  However, Tandy does
have  some   concentration  of  credit  risk  in  the  wireless   telephone  and
direct-to-home   satellite  services  industries  due  to  increased  sales  and
outstanding balances as of December 31, 1999 from these service providers.

Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally  based on
average cost) or market value and are comprised primarily of finished goods.

Property,  Plant and  Equipment:  Property and equipment are stated at cost. For
financial  reporting  purposes,  depreciation  and  amortization  are  primarily
calculated  using the  straight-line  method,  which  amortizes  the cost of the
assets over their estimated useful lives.  When  depreciable  assets are sold or
retired,  the related  cost and  accumulated  depreciation  are removed from the
accounts.   Any  gains  or  losses  are   included  in   selling,   general  and
administrative   ("SG&A")   expense.   Major   additions  and   betterments  are
capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs which do not materially  improve or extend
the  lives of the  respective  assets  are  charged  to  operating  expenses  as
incurred.  Amortization  of  buildings  under  capital  leases  is  included  in
depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Capitalized  Software  Costs:  Tandy  capitalizes  qualifying  costs relating to
developing or obtaining  internal-use  software.  Capitalization of costs begins
after the conceptual formulation stage has been completed. Capitalized costs are
amortized  over the  estimated  useful life of the  software,  which ranges from
three to five years.

Goodwill:  Goodwill,  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of net assets  acquired,  is amortized on a straight-line  basis over
the expected life of the underlying assets.  Goodwill was $52.9 million and $3.2
million,  net of  accumulated  amortization  of $0.9 million and $0.4 million at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Goodwill and amortization expense for
1999 related primarily to the acquisition of AmeriLink Corporation ("AmeriLink")
in July 1999 (see Note 5 - "AmeriLink Acquisition").

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:  Long-lived assets (primarily  property,  plant
and  equipment  and  goodwill)  held and used by Tandy or to be  disposed of are
reviewed for impairment  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate
that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss
is recognized  if the sum of the expected  future cash flows  (undiscounted  and
before  interest)  from the use of the asset is less than the net book  value of
the asset.  The amount of the  impairment  loss is  measured  as the  difference
between  the net book value of the assets  and the  estimated  fair value of the
related assets.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  The fair value of financial instruments is
determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques as
appropriate.   Unless  otherwise   disclosed,   the  fair  values  of  financial
instruments  approximate  their recorded  values due primarily to the short-term
nature of their maturities or their varying interest rate.

Revenues:  Retail sales are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Residual  income is
recognized  based upon the  contractual  percentage of each  customer's  monthly
bill.

Extended  Service  Contracts:  Tandy's retail  operations offer extended service
contracts on products sold. These contracts  generally  provide extended service
coverage for periods of 12 to 60 months.  Tandy offers these contracts on behalf
of an unrelated third party, who is named as obligor on these  contracts.  Tandy
is not named as an obligor on these contracts.  In these circumstances,  Tandy's
share of commission revenue is recognized as income at the time of sale.

During  1997,  Tandy  sold its own  extended  service  contracts  in one  state.
Revenues from the sale of these contracts are recognized  ratably over the lives
of the contracts. Costs directly related to sales of such contracts are deferred
and charged to expense proportionately as the revenues are recognized. A loss is
recognized  on extended  service  contracts if the sum of the expected  costs of
providing services pursuant to the contracts exceeds related unearned revenue.

Income  Taxes:  Income  taxes are  accounted  for using the asset and  liability
method.  Deferred taxes are recognized  for the tax  consequences  of "temporary
differences" by applying enacted  statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to  differences  between the financial  statement  carrying  amounts and the tax
basis of existing  assets and  liabilities.  The effect on  deferred  taxes of a
change in tax rates is  recognized  in income in the period  that  includes  the
enactment date. In addition,  Tandy recognizes future tax benefits to the extent
that realization of such benefits are more likely than not.

Earnings  Per Share:  Basic  earnings  per share is  computed  based only on the
weighted average number of common shares  outstanding for each period presented.
Dilutive  earnings per share  reflects the  potential  dilution  that would have
occurred if securities or other  contracts to issue common stock were exercised,
converted,  or  resulted in the  issuance  of common  stock that would have then
shared in the earnings of the entity.

The following table  reconciles the numerator and denominator  used in the basic
and diluted  earnings  per share  calculation  for the years ended  December 31,
1999, 1998 and 1997:

Options to purchase  3.3 million,  3.4 million and 1.4 million  shares of common
stock in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, were not included in the computation
of diluted  earnings  per common  share  because the option  exercise  price was
greater than the average market price of the common stock during the year.

Stock-Based  Compensation:  Tandy has  adopted  SFAS No.  123,  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation"  ("FAS  123"),  on a  disclosure  basis  only.  Tandy
measures  compensation  costs  under  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion 25,
"Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to  Employees"   ("APB  25")  and  its  related
interpretations.

Advertising  Costs:  All advertising  costs of Tandy are expensed the first time
the advertising  takes place.  Advertising  expense was $199.9  million,  $208.7
million and $195.4 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

Comprehensive  Income (Loss):  Effective January 1, 1998, Tandy adopted SFAS No.
130, "Reporting  Comprehen-sive  Income." Comprehensive income is defined as the
change in equity (net assets) of a business  enterprise during a period,  except
those changes resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.

The following tables summarize the tax effects of other comprehensive income and

New  Pronouncements:  In June 1998,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board
("FASB") issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities."  In June 1999,  the FASB  issued SFAS No.  137,  which  delayed the
effective date of SFAS No. 133 to quarters  beginning  after June 15, 2000. SFAS
No. 133 requires a company to record all derivative instruments at fair value on
the balance sheet. Tandy does not use derivatives for speculative  purposes.  As
such, its market risk was not material in 1999.

NOTE 3 - STOCK SPLIT
On May 20, 1999,  Tandy's  Board of Directors  declared a  two-for-one  split of
Tandy common stock,  payable on June 21, 1999.  This resulted in the issuance of
96.6 million shares of common stock along with a corresponding decrease of $96.6
million in additional paid-in capital.  Treasury shares were not split. However,
an adjustment  was made to Tandy's  stockholders'  equity section of the balance
sheet to split the cost of treasury stock (in effect a cancellation  of treasury
shares by reducing paid-in capital and retained earnings). All references to the
number of shares  (other than common  stock  issued or  outstanding  on the 1998
Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  and  1997  and  1998  Consolidated  Statements  of
Stockholders'  Equity),  per  share  amounts,  cash  dividends,  and  any  other
reference to shares in the Consolidated  Financial Statements,  the accompanying
Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements  ("Notes"),  unless otherwise noted,
have been  adjusted  to reflect  the split on a  retroactive  basis.  Previously
awarded stock options, restricted stock awards, and all other agreements payable
in Tandy's common stock have also been adjusted or amended to reflect the split.

NOTE 4 - SALE OF COMPUTER CITY, INC.
On August 31, 1998,  Tandy completed the sale of 100% of the outstanding  common
stock of its Computer City, Inc. subsidiary to CompUSA Inc. ("CompUSA").  In the
third quarter of 1998, Tandy received approximately $75.0 million in cash and an
unsecured  subordinated  note for $136.0 million as consideration  for the sale.
The amount of cash to be retained  was subject to  adjustment  and in the fourth
quarter of 1998 the amount of cash  consideration  was reduced to $36.5 million.
Tandy  recognized  a loss of $108.2  million  in 1998 from the sale of  Computer
City, which included certain liabilities and contractual obligations incurred by
Tandy.

The note  bears  interest  at 9.48%  per annum  and is  payable  over a ten year
period.  Interest is payable on June 30 and  December 31 of each year,  with the
first  payment  made on December  31,  1998.  Beginning  on December  31,  2001,
principal  payments will be due semiannually  until the note matures on June 30,
2008. Tandy intends to hold the subordinated  note until maturity.  The note had
an estimated fair value of $133.0 million at December 31, 1999.

Computer City's results from operations  through August 31, 1998 are included in
the accompanying  Consolidated  Financial Statements.  Below is a summary of net
sales and operating revenues and net losses, for Computer City:

(1) Includes  operations for only eight months, due to sale to CompUSA on August
    31, 1998.

NOTE 5 - AMERILINK ACQUISITION
On July 30, 1999, Tandy acquired AmeriLink in an all stock transaction valued at
approximately $75.8 million. Tandy exchanged approximately 1.8 million shares of
Tandy common stock for all of the  outstanding  common stock of  AmeriLink.  The
transaction  was  accounted  for under the purchase  method of  accounting.  The
purchase  price was  allocated to the assets  acquired and  liabilities  assumed
based on their  estimated  fair  values  at the date of the  acquisition,  which
resulted in  approximately  $50.7  million of goodwill  being  recorded in other
assets on the  accompanying  1999  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  The associated
goodwill will be amortized over 20 years.

NOTE 6 - RADIOSHACK.COM, LLC
In   October   1999,   Tandy   launched   its   e-commerce    enabled   website,
www.RadioShack.com.  On November 10, 1999,  Tandy and Microsoft formed a limited
liability company, RadioShack.com,  LLC ("RS.com"), for the purpose of marketing
and selling electronics  products on the Internet.  Tandy contributed assets and
also extended a royalty-free license for certain trademarks and service marks to
RS.com  and  Microsoft  contributed  cash of $100.0  million on January 4, 2000.
Tandy owns 100% of the common units of RS.com,  while Microsoft owns 100% of the
preferred  units and Tandy will  include  RS.com in its  consolidated  financial
statements.  Tandy is  entitled  to  receive  75% of the  profits  and losses of
RS.com,  while  Microsoft will receive 25%;  however,  the preferred  units have
liquidation  rights  which  could  impact the  allocation  of profits and losses
between the unit holders.  The preferred units are convertible into common units
at any time and must be converted in the event of certain capital  transactions.
In certain circumstances,  Microsoft has the option to require Tandy to purchase
its units and Tandy has the right to purchase  Microsoft's  units.  Also, in the
event of liquidation,  the preferred units have  preferential  rights to recover
their initial investment.

NOTE 7 - 1996 BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING
In the fourth quarter of 1996, Tandy initiated  certain  restructuring  programs
resulting from the highly competitive environment in the electronics industry at
the time. In conjunction with these programs,  Tandy closed 53 McDuff stores and
21 unprofitable Computer City stores in January 1997. Additionally, Tandy either
closed or sold all of its Incredible  Universe stores during 1997.  During 1997,
Tandy sold the assets related to several  closed  stores,  including the sale of
the real estate,  related fixed assets and inventory of six Incredible  Universe
stores, to Fry's Electronics, Inc. and its affiliates ("Fry's). These six stores
were sold for  approximately  $21.5  million in cash and $97.4  million in notes
receivable  with no material gain or loss  recognized upon the sale. At December
31, 1999,  the notes  receivable  balance was $26.3 million with interest  rates
ranging from 6.57% to 6.70% and maturity  dates in 2001 and 2002.  Tandy intends
to hold the notes until maturity. The notes had an estimated fair value of $25.0
million at December 31, 1999.

Net sales and  operating  revenues  and  operating  losses of the stores  closed
pursuant to the restructuring plans are shown below for each year ended December
31 (unaudited):

NOTE 11 - TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On  March 3,  1997,  Tandy  announced  that its  Board of  Directors  authorized
management to purchase up to 20.0 million  additional shares of its common stock
through Tandy's existing share repurchase program.  The share repurchase program
was initially  authorized in December 1995 and increased in October 1996 and was
undertaken  as a result of  management's  view of the economic  value of Tandy's
stock.  The  share  increase  for 1997  brought  the total  authorization  since
inception to 60.0 million  shares,  of which  approximately  56.7 million shares
totaling  $949.2  million  had  been   repurchased  as  of  December  31,  1999.
Approximately  4.8 million  shares were  repurchased  in 1999 for $203.4 million
under the program.

Additionally,  on October 26, 1998,  Tandy announced that its Board of Directors
authorized  the  repurchase of up to 10.0 million shares of Tandy's common stock
for an  indefinite  period of time to be used to offset the  dilution  of grants
under  Tandy's  incentive  stock  plans  (see  Note  19  -  "Stock  Options  and
Performance Awards").  Approximately 4.2 million shares were repurchased in 1999
for $190.7  million,  bringing the total share  repurchase  at December 31, 1999
under this program to 7.0 million shares totaling $254.5 million.

These purchases under the two share repurchase  programs  described above are in
addition to the shares  required for employee  stock plans,  which are purchased
throughout the year.

In connection  with the share  repurchase  program,  the Board of Directors,  at
their October 23, 1998 meeting,  authorized management to sell up to 2.0 million
put options on Tandy common  stock.  Such put options  grant the  purchaser  the
right to sell shares of Tandy's  common stock to Tandy at specified  prices upon
exercise of the put options.  These put options are exercisable only at maturity
and can be settled in cash at Tandy's option, in lieu of repurchasing the stock.
The  issued put  options  have a maturity  of up to six  months.  Tandy has sold
approximately 1.4 million put options since the inception of the program and 0.4
million put options  remained  outstanding at December 31, 1999. The put options
expire on various dates  through April 2000. At December 31, 1999 and 1998,  the
full  redemption  value of the put options was  classified  as common  stock put
options in the accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheets. The related offset was
recorded in common stock in treasury, net of premiums received.

NOTE 12 - INDEBTEDNESS AND BORROWING FACILITIES
Tandy's  short-term  credit  facilities,  including  revolving credit lines, are
summarized in the accompanying  short-term borrowing facilities table below. The
method used to compute averages in the short-term  borrowing facilities table is
based on a daily weighted average computation which takes into consideration the
time period such debt was outstanding as well as the amount outstanding. Tandy's
primary  source of short-term  debt,  for which  borrowings  and  repayments are
presented net of each other in the accompanying  Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows,  consists of short-term  seasonal  bank debt and  commercial  paper.  The
commercial  paper  has a  typical  maturity  of 90 days  or  less,  as does  the
short-term  seasonal  bank  debt.  The  amount of  commercial  paper that may be
outstanding is limited to a maximum of $500.0 million.

In the second  quarter of 1999,  Tandy  extended the maturity date of its $200.0
million 364-day  revolving credit facility to June 2000. Tandy also has a $300.0
million  five-year  revolving credit facility  maturing June 2003. The revolving
credit  facilities are used as backup for the  commercial  paper program and may
also be utilized for general corporate purposes.  Annual commitment fees for the
facilities are 0.07% of the $200.0 million  facility per annum and 0.085% of the
$300.0 million facility per annum, whether used or unused. Tandy plans to extend
the $200.0 million facility to June 2001 during the second quarter of 2000.

In May 1997,  Tandy filed a $300.0  million  Debt Shelf  Registration  Statement
("Shelf  Registration") with the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  which was
declared  effective in August 1997. In August 1997,  Tandy issued $150.0 million
of 10 year unsecured  notes under the Shelf  Registration.  The interest rate on
the notes is 6.95% per annum with interest payable on September 1 and March 1 of
each year,  commencing  March 1, 1998.  The notes are due  September 1, 2007. In
December  1997 and January  1998,  Tandy issued $4.0 million and $45.0  million,
respectively,  in  medium-term  notes under the remaining  $150.0  million Shelf
Registration.  An additional  $32.0 million,  $37.0 million and $32.0 million of
medium-term  notes were issued in January 1999,  August 1999 and September 1999,
respectively,  completing the remaining 1997 Shelf Registration.  Tandy's medium
and  long-term  notes  outstanding  at  December  31,  1999 under the 1997 Shelf
Registration  totaled $300.0 million,  compared to $199.0 million outstanding at
December 31, 1998. The interest  rates at December 31, 1999 for the  outstanding
$150.0 million in  medium-term  notes ranged from 6.09% to 7.35% with a weighted
average coupon rate of 6.6%.

Tandy  established  an  employee  stock  ownership  trust in June 1990.  Further
information  on the trust and its related  indebtedness,  which is guaranteed by
the Company, is detailed in the discussion of the Tandy Fund in Note 17.

Long-term  borrowings and capital lease obligations  outstanding at December 31,
1999 mature as follows:

The fair value of Tandy's  long-term debt of $321.2 million  (including  current
portion,  but excluding  capital  leases) was  approximately  $317.0  million at
December 31, 1999.  The fair value was computed  using interest rates which were
in effect at December 31, 1999 for similar debt instruments.  Borrowings payable
within one year are summarized in the accompanying  short-term debt table below.
Short-term  debt at December 31, 1999 and 1998  consisted  primarily of domestic
seasonal borrowings.

NOTE 14 - LEASES AND COMMITMENTS
Tandy leases  rather than owns most of its  facilities.  The  RadioShack  stores
comprise the largest portion of Tandy's leased facilities. The RadioShack stores
are located  primarily in major  shopping  malls and shopping  centers  owned by
other companies.  Some leases are based on a minimum rental plus a percentage of
the  store's  sales in excess of a  stipulated  base  figure.  Tandy also leases
distribution  centers and office space.  In addition,  Tandy has capital  leases
related to its computer and operating systems.

Future  minimum  rent  commitments  at  December  31,  1999  for  all  long-term
noncancelable  leases (net of  immaterial  amounts of sublease  rent income) are
included in the following table.

Management anticipates generating enough pre-tax income in the future to realize
the full  benefit  of U.S.  deferred  tax assets  related  to future  deductible
amounts. Accordingly, a valuation allowance is not required at December 31, 1999
or 1998.

NOTE 16 - TANDY STOCK PLAN
Eligible  employees may contribute 1% to 7% of annual  compensation  to purchase
Tandy common stock at the monthly  average  daily closing  price.  Tandy matches
40%, 60% or 80% of the employee's  contribution,  depending on the length of the
employee's  continuous  participation in the Tandy Stock Plan. The Company match
is also for the purchase of Tandy common  stock.  Tandy's  contributions  to the
Stock Plan were $15.6  million,  $14.5  million and $13.7  million for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

NOTE 17 - TANDY FUND
The Tandy Fund ("Plan") is a defined  contribution plan.  Eligible employees may
direct their contributions into various investment options,  including investing
in Tandy common stock.  Participants may defer, via payroll reductions, 1% to 8%
of annual  compensation.  Contributions  per  participant are limited to certain
annual maximums  permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.  Company  contributions
are made directly to the Plan through the Tandy  Employees  Stock Ownership Plan
("TESOP") portion of the Plan. The TESOP is a leveraged employee stock ownership
plan. Participants become fully vested in Company contributions upon the earlier
to occur of five years of service with Tandy or three years of  participation in
the Plan.

TESOP  Portion of the Plan:  On July 31, 1990,  the trustee of the Plan borrowed
$100.0  million at an interest rate of 9.34% with varying  semiannual  principal
payments due through June 30, 2000  ("TESOP  Notes").  The Plan trustee used the
proceeds  from the  issuance of the TESOP Notes to  purchase  100,000  shares of
TESOP  Preferred  Stock from Tandy at a price of $1,000 per share.  In  December
1994,  the Plan  entered  into an  agreement  with an  unrelated  third party to
refinance up to $16.7 million of the TESOP Notes in a series of up to six annual
notes,  beginning  December  30, 1994.  As of December  31,  1999,  the Plan had
borrowed all of the $16.7  million (the  "Refinanced  Notes") in a series of six
notes at  interest  rates  ranging  from 5.84% to 8.76% to  refinance  the TESOP
Notes.  The  maturity  dates of these  six notes  range  from  December  2000 to
December 2002.  Dividend  payments and  contributions  received by the Plan from
Tandy will be used to repay the indebtedness.

Each share of TESOP Preferred  Stock is convertible  into 87.072 shares of Tandy
common stock. The annual cumulative  dividend on TESOP Preferred Stock is $75.00
per share, payable  semiannually.  Because Tandy has guaranteed the repayment of
the TESOP  Notes  and the  Refinanced  Notes,  the  indebtedness  of the Plan is
recognized as a long-term  obligation in the accompanying  Consolidated  Balance
Sheets. An offsetting  charge has been made in the stockholders'  equity section
of the accompanying  Consolidated  Balance Sheets to reflect  unearned  deferred
compensation related to the Plan.

Compensation and interest  expenses related to the Plan before the reduction for
the allocation of dividends are presented below for each year ended December 31:

(In millions)                  1999          1998           1997
- -------------                  ----          ----           ----
Compensation expense         $  8.7        $ 10.2         $  9.5
Interest expense                2.3           3.4            4.4

During the terms of the TESOP Notes and Refinanced  Notes,  the TESOP  Preferred
Stock will be allocated to the  participants  annually,  based on the total debt
service made on the  indebtedness.  As shares of the TESOP  Preferred  Stock are
allocated to Plan  participants,  compensation  expense is recorded and unearned
deferred  compensation  is  reduced.  Interest  expense  on the TESOP  Notes and
Refinanced  Notes is also  recognized  as a cost of the Plan.  The  compensation
component of the Plan  expense is reduced by the amount of dividends  accrued on
the TESOP  Preferred  Stock,  with any  dividends in excess of the  compensation
expense reflected as a reduction of interest expense.

Contributions from Tandy to the Plan for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998
and 1997 totaled $12.0 million,  $14.7 million and $14.5 million,  respectively,
including  dividends  paid on the TESOP  Preferred  Stock of $5.5 million,  $5.8
million and $6.1 million, respectively.

As of  December  31,  1999,  83,686  shares  of TESOP  Preferred  Stock had been
released  to  participants'  accounts  in  the  Plan,  including  27,243  shares
previously withdrawn by participants. A total of 75,442 of these shares had also
been allocated to participants'  accounts as of year end and the remaining 8,244
shares will be allocated to participants'  accounts on the March 31, 2000 annual
allocation  date. At December 31, 1999,  16,314 shares of TESOP  Preferred Stock
were available for later release and allocation to  participants'  accounts over
the remaining life of the TESOP Notes and Refinanced  Notes. The appraised value
of these  remaining  shares was $70.5  million at December 31,  1999.  The TESOP
Preferred  Stock has certain  liquidation  preferences and may be redeemed after
July 1, 1994, at specified premiums.

NOTE 18 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
In October 1997, the Board of Directors approved the Tandy Corporation Executive
Deferred  Compensation Plan and the Tandy Corporation  Executive  Deferred Stock
Plan  ("Compensation  Plans"),  which became  effective on April 1, 1998.  These
plans permit employees who are corporate or division officers to defer up to 80%
of their base salary and/or bonuses.  Certain executive officers may defer up to
100% of their base salary and/or bonuses. In addition, officers are permitted to
defer any  restricted  stock or  nonstatutory  stock  option  gains  that  would
otherwise  vest.  Cash deferrals may be invested in Tandy common stock or mutual
funds; however, restricted stock and nonstatutory stock option gains may only be
invested in Tandy common stock.  Tandy matches 12% of salary and bonus deferrals
in the form of Tandy common stock.  Tandy will match an additional 25% of salary
and bonus  deferrals if the deferral period exceeds five years and the deferrals
are invested in Tandy common  stock.  Payment of deferrals  will be made in cash
and Tandy common stock in accordance with the employee's  specifications  at the
time of the  deferral;  payments  may be  received  in a lump  sum or in  annual
installments not to exceed 20 years.

Contributions  from Tandy to the Compensation Plans for the years ended December
31, 1999 and 1998 totaled $1.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

NOTE 19 - STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS
Tandy applies APB 25 and related  interpretations  in  accounting  for its stock
option plans,  which are described  below.  Historically,  the exercise price of
options has been equal to or greater  than the fair market  value on the date of
grant.

The 1993,  1997 and 1999  Incentive  Stock Plans ("ISP"s)  described  below each
terminate on the tenth anniversary of the day preceding its adoption date by the
Board;  no option or award may be granted under each plan after the  termination
date.  The terms for  grants of  options  under  each ISP are  specified  by the
Organization  and  Compensation  Committee  (the  "Committee");  terms  of these
options  may not  exceed  10  years.  Option  agreements  issued  under the ISPs
generally provide that, in the event of a change in control,  all options become
immediately and fully exercisable.

Tandy's three ISPs specify that each non-employee director of Tandy will receive
a grant of  nonstatutory  stock options  (options which are not incentive  stock
options ) ("NSOs") for 16,000 shares of Tandy common stock on the first business
day of September of each year ("Director Options").  New directors upon election
or appointment will receive a one-time grant of 20,000 shares.  Director Options
under the 1993 and 1997 ISPs have an  exercise  price of 100% of the fair market
value of Tandy  common  stock on the  trading  day  prior to the date of  grant.
Director  Options under the 1999 ISP have an exercise  price of 100% of the fair
market value of a share of Tandy  common stock on the date of grant.  If a grant
is made under the 1999 ISP on a non-trading  date, the closest  previous trading
date is used. For Director Options under the three ISPs, one-third of the shares
vest  annually  on the first  three  anniversary  dates of the date of grant and
shares expire 10 years after the date of grant.

The exercise  price of shares under an option (other than a Director  Option) is
determined by the  Committee,  provided that the exercise price is not less than
100% of the fair market  value of a share of Tandy's  common  stock on the grant
date.

Tandy  Corporation  1985 Stock Option Plan ("1985 SOP"):  Under the 1985 SOP, as
amended,  options to acquire up to 8.0 million  shares of Tandy's  common  stock
were authorized to be granted to officers and key management employees of Tandy.
The 1985 SOP expired in 1995 and no further  grants may be made under this plan.
Under the 1985 SOP,  there were 38,298 and 529,342  vested  options  which could
have been  exercised  for a total  price of $0.3  million  and $4.0  million  at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Tandy  Corporation  1993 Incentive Stock Plan ("1993 ISP"): The 1993 ISP permits
the grant of up to 12.0 million  shares in the form of incentive  stock  options
("ISOs"),   NSOs,  stock   appreciation   rights  ("SARs"),   restricted  stock,
performance units or performance shares.

Under the 1993 ISP,  there were  2,489,569  and 4,116,852  vested  options which
could have been  exercised for a total exercise price of $32.0 million and $51.2
million at December 31, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  In  addition,  there were
693,650  and  665,652   shares   available   at  December  31,  1999  and  1998,
respectively, for additional grants under the 1993 ISP.

On February 1, 1997,  in an effort to reduce the  turnover  rate among its store
managers and to align the store managers'  interests and goals with those of the
shareholders,  Tandy  granted,  under  the  1993  ISP,  approximately  4,082,400
restricted stock awards  consisting of 800 shares each to 4,907 RadioShack store
managers and 1,600 shares each to 98 Computer City store managers.  The February
1997 restricted  stock awards had a weighted average fair market value of $11.30
per share when  granted.  This  restricted  stock was to vest at the end of five
years on February 2, 2002,  if managers  receiving  the grants were  employed by
Tandy at a store manager or higher position,  at that time. However,  the grants
provided  that the  restricted  shares would vest early if Tandy's  common stock
closed  at  $16.90625  or more for any 20  consecutive  trading  days  beginning
February 1, 1999.  At December 31,  1998,  it was  probable  that the  2,579,200
shares  that  remained  outstanding  under this grant would vest under the early
vesting  provisions.  The  resulting  charge to  compensation  expense  of $82.6
million,  including related payroll taxes, was recorded in the December 31, 1998
financial statements. The awards vested on March 1, 1999 and the actual price of
the stock and the number of shares vested  differed  slightly from the estimated
accrual at December 31, 1998. The amount of this difference,  $5.1 million,  was
recorded as a credit to expense in the first quarter of 1999.

Tandy  Corporation  1997 Incentive Stock Plan ("1997 ISP"): The 1997 ISP permits
the  grant  of up to 11.0  million  shares  in the  form of  ISOs,  NSOs,  SARs,
restricted stock, performance units or performance shares. The 1997 ISP provides
that the  maximum  number of  shares  of Tandy  common  stock  that an  eligible
employee may receive in any calendar year in respect to options and  performance
awards may not exceed 1.0 million  shares.  The maximum dollar amount of cash or
the fair market value of shares in any calendar  year in respect of  performance
units may not exceed $1.5 million.

Under the 1997 ISP,  there were  916,811  vested  options  which could have been
exercised  for a total  exercise  price of $22.9  million at December  31, 1999;
there were 2,000 vested  options at December 31, 1998.  In addition,  there were
4,591,568  and  6,760,000  shares  available  on  December  31,  1999 and  1998,
respectively, for grants under the 1997 ISP.

On February 1, 1998, Tandy granted,  under the 1997 ISP,  approximately  649,500
restricted stock awards  consisting of 500 shares each to 1,299 RadioShack store
managers  not  included  in the  February  1, 1997 grant  described  above.  The
February 1998 restricted  stock awards had a weighted  average fair market value
of $19.61 per share when granted. This restricted stock grant was to vest at the
end of five years on February 2, 2003,  if  managers  receiving  the grants were
employed by Tandy at a store manager or higher position,  at that time. However,
the grants  provided  that the  restricted  shares would vest early if the Tandy
common  stock  closed at $29.0625 or more for any 20  consecutive  trading  days
beginning  February 1, 2000.  At December 31, 1999, it was probable that 348,000
restricted  stock awards that remained  outstanding  under this grant would vest
under early vesting provisions.  The resulting charge to compensation expense of
$14.7 million, including related payroll taxes, was recorded in the December 31,
1999 financial statements.

Also during 1998, the Committee  granted a total of 172,000 shares of restricted
stock awards to three executive  officers;  60,000 shares granted under the 1997
ISP and 40,000 shares  granted under the 1993 ISP vest ratably over a three year
period.  The remaining  72,000 shares,  which were granted under the 1997 ISP to
one  executive  officer,  were to vest on October 23, 2005;  however,  shares in
blocks of 24,000  would vest  earlier if Tandy's  common  stock  price  exceeded
certain  levels for 15  consecutive  trading  days.  All of these 72,000  shares
vested in 1999.

Tandy  Corporation 1999 Incentive Stock Plan ("1999 ISP"): In February 1999, the
Board of Directors authorized the adoption of the 1999 ISP. The 1999 ISP permits
the grant of up to 9.5 million shares in the form of NSOs and stock appreciation
rights to broad based employee groups,  primarily  RadioShack's 5,000 plus store
managers, and to other eligible employees and non-employee directors.  Grants of
restricted  stock,  performance  awards  and  options  intended  to  qualify  as
incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code are not authorized under
the 1999 ISP. In addition,  repricing of  outstanding  options is not  permitted
under the 1999 ISP. The 1999 ISP provides  that the maximum  number of shares of
Tandy common stock that an eligible employee may receive in any calendar year in
respect to options and SARs may not exceed 1.0 million shares.

Under the 1999 ISP,  there  were  4,600  vested  options  which  could have been
exercised  for a total  exercise  price of $0.2 million at December 31, 1999. In
addition,  there were 5,856,900 shares available on December 31, 1999 for grants
under the 1999 ISP.

Pro Forma Information:  Pro forma information  regarding net income and earnings
per share as required by FAS 123 has been  determined  as if Tandy had accounted
for its employee stock options and restricted  stock awards under the fair value
method of that  statement.  The fair value of each  option or  restricted  stock
award is estimated on the date of grant using the  Black-Scholes  option pricing
model.  The weighted  average  assumptions used for stock option grants in 1999,
1998 and 1997 were,  respectively:  expected  dividend  yields of 1.7%, 1.6% and
1.7%; expected  volatilities of 30.9%, 24.3% and 25.5%; risk free interest rates
of 5.5%,  4.5% and 6.1% and expected  lives of six years.  The weighted  average
assumptions  used for  restricted  stock grants in 1998 and 1997 were:  expected
dividend yields of 1.6% and 1.7%; expected volatilities of 24.8% and 25.9%; risk
free interest rates of 5.4% and 6.3% and expected lives of five years.

For purposes of pro forma  disclosures,  the estimated fair value of the options

NOTE 20 - PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
In August 1986,  the Board of Directors  adopted a  stockholder  rights plan and
declared  a dividend  of one right for each  outstanding  share of Tandy  common
stock.  This plan was amended and restated on July 24, 1999. The rights plan, as
amended and  restated,  will expire on July 26, 2009.  The rights are  currently
represented   by  the  common  stock   certificates.   When  the  rights  become
exercisable,  they will entitle each holder to purchase 1/10,000th of a share of
Tandy Series A Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock for an exercise  price of
$250 (subject to adjustment).  The rights will become exercisable and will trade
separately from the common stock only upon the date of public  announcement that
a  person,  entity  or group  ("Person")  has  acquired  15% or more of  Tandy's
outstanding  common stock  without the consent or approval of the  disinterested
directors  ("Acquiring  Person")  or ten days after the  commencement  or public
announcement  of a tender or exchange  offer  which  would  result in any Person
becoming an Acquiring  Person. In the event that any Person becomes an Acquiring
Person,  the rights will be exercisable  for 60 days thereafter for Tandy common
stock with a market value (as  determined  under the rights plan) equal to twice
the exercise  price.  In the event that,  after any Person  becomes an Acquiring
Person,  Tandy engages in certain  mergers,  consolidations,  or sales of assets
representing 50% or more of its assets or earning power with an Acquiring Person
(or Persons  acting on behalf of or in concert with an  Acquiring  Person) or in
which all  holders of common  stock are not  treated  alike,  the rights will be
exercisable for common stock of the acquiring or surviving company with a market
value (as determined  under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise  price.
The rights  will not be  exercisable  by any  Acquiring  Person.  The rights are
redeemable  at a price of  $0.01  per  right  prior to any  Person  becoming  an
Acquiring  Person or, under  certain  circumstances,  after a Person  becomes an
Acquiring Person.

NOTE 21 - TERMINATION PROTECTION PLANS
In August 1990 and in May 1995, Tandy's Board of Directors approved  termination
protection   plans  and  amendments  to  the   termination   protection   plans,
respectively. These plans provide for defined termination benefits to be paid to
eligible employees of Tandy who have been terminated, without cause, following a
change in control of the Company (as defined). In addition, for a certain period
of time following employee termination,  Tandy, at its expense, must continue to
provide on behalf of the terminated  employee certain  employment  benefits.  In
general,  during the twelve months following a change in control,  Tandy may not
terminate or change existing employee benefit plans in any way which will affect
accrued benefits or decrease the rate of the Tandy's contribution to the plans.

NOTE 22 - SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
Cash flows from operating activities included cash payments as follows:

                                     Year Ended December 31,
                                 -------------------------------
(In millions)                      1999        1998       1997

Interest paid                    $   35.2    $   46.9   $   42.8
Income taxes paid                    81.8        84.2       51.9

Tandy  received a  subordinated  unsecured  note for  $136.0  million in 1998 as
partial payment on the sale of CCI to CompUSA.  In 1998 and 1997, Tandy received
notes  receivable of $3.0 million and $98.3  million,  respectively,  as partial
payment on the sales of Incredible Universe assets.

No capital  lease  obligations  were  recorded  in 1999 or 1998.  Capital  lease
obligations  of  $22.1  million  were  recorded  during  1997  for the  lease of
equipment and certain retail stores.

NOTE 23 - CONTINGENCIES
Tandy has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties,  investigations
and pending  actions  involving  allegations  of  negligence,  product  defects,
discrimination,  infringement of intellectual property rights, tax deficiencies,
violations  of permits or  licenses,  and breach of contract  and other  matters
against  Tandy and its  subsidiaries  incident to the operation of its business.
The liability,  if any,  associated  with these matters was not  determinable at
December 31, 1999.  Although  occasional adverse  settlements or resolutions may
occur  and  negatively  impact  earnings  in the year of  settlement,  it is the
opinion of management that their ultimate  resolution will not have a materially
adverse effect on Tandy's financial position.

NOTE 24 - RELATIONS WITH INTERTAN
InterTAN, Inc. ("InterTAN"),  the former foreign retail operations of Tandy, was
spun off to Tandy  stockholders as a tax-free dividend in fiscal 1987. Under the
terms of a  merchandise  agreement  reached with  InterTAN in October  1993,  as
amended,  InterTAN may  purchase,  on payment  terms,  certain  products sold or
secured by Tandy. A&A International  Limited Partnership ("A&A"),  which is 100%
owned by Tandy and its  subsidiaries,  is and will  continue to be the exclusive
purchasing  agent for products  originating  in Asia for InterTAN.  A&A receives
commission income for this service. License agreements, as amended, also provide
a royalty  payable to Tandy.  The table below  summarizes the income  components
generated from operations relative to InterTAN:

NOTE 26 - QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)
As Tandy's operations are predominantly retail oriented, its business is subject
to seasonal fluctuations with the December 31 quarter being the most significant
in terms of sales and profits because of the Christmas selling season.

As a result of the sale of  Computer  City (see Note 4),  Tandy  recorded a loss
provision of $108.2  million in 1998.  Tandy  recorded $73.2 million of the loss
provision  during the second quarter upon announcing the sale,  $30.0 million in
the third quarter and $5.0 million in the fourth quarter upon  completion of due
diligence.  Additionally,  Tandy recorded  provisions of $14.7 million and $82.6
million  related to restricted  stock awards for RadioShack  store managers (see
Note 19) in the fourth quarters of 1999 and 1998, respectively.

stockholder and bearing a date not more than three years prior to the meeting in
question, unless said instrument provides for a longer period during which it is
to remain in force.

At all meetings of the stockholders,  a quorum being present,  all matters shall
be decided by  majority  vote of the  shares of stock  entitled  to vote held by
stockholders  present in person or by proxy, except as otherwise required by the
Certificate  of  Incorporation  or the laws of the State of Delaware.  Unless so
directed by the chairman of the meeting, or required by the laws of the State of
Delaware, the vote thereat on any question need not be by ballot.

On a vote by ballot,  each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder  voting, or
in his name by his proxy, if there be such proxy,  and shall state the number of
shares voted by him and the number of votes to which each share is entitled.  On
a vote by ballot,  the chairman  shall appoint two  inspectors of election,  who
shall first take and subscribe an oath or affirmation  faithfully to execute the
duties of inspector at such meeting with strict  impartiality  and  according to
the best of their  ability  and who shall take charge of the polls and after the
balloting  shall  make a  certificate  of the result of the vote  taken;  but no
director or  candidate  for the office of director  shall be  appointed  as such
inspector.

SECTION  7.  Stock  List.  At least  ten (10)  days  before  every  election  of
directors,  a complete list of  stockholders  entitled to vote at such election,
arranged in  alphabetical  order,  with the  residence of each and the number of
voting shares held by each shall be prepared by the  Secretary.  Such list shall
be open at the place where the election is to be held for said ten (10) days, to
the examination of any  stockholder  entitled to vote at that election and shall
be  produced  and kept at the time and place of  election  during the whole time
thereof, and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.

SECTION 8.  Notice of Stockholder Proposals.

days'  notice or prior public  disclosure  of the date of the  scheduled  annual
meeting  is given or made,  notice by the  stockholder  to be timely  must be so
delivered  or received  not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th)
day  following  the  earlier of the day on which such  notice of the date of the
scheduled  annual meeting was mailed or the day on which such public  disclosure
was made. A  stockholder's  notice to the  Secretary  shall set forth as to each
matter the  stockholder  proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief
description of the proposal  desired to be brought before the annual meeting and
the reasons for conducting  such business at the annual  meeting,  (ii) the name

Corporation's  stock which are beneficially owned by the stockholder on the date
of  such  stockholder  notice  and by  any  other  stockholders  known  by  such
stockholder  to be  supporting  such  proposal  on the date of such  stockholder
notice, and (iv) any financial interest of the stockholder in such proposal.

        (b) If the presiding  officer of the annual  meeting  determines  that a
stockholder  proposal was not made in accordance  with the terms of this Section
8, he shall so declare at the annual  meeting and any such proposal shall not be
acted upon at the annual meeting.

        (c) This provision shall not prevent the  consideration  and approval or
disapproval  at the  annual  meeting  of  reports  of  officers,  directors  and
committees of the Board of Directors,  but, in connection with such reports,  no
business shall be acted upon at such annual  meeting  unless  stated,  filed and
received as herein provided.

        (d) Any stockholder seeking to bring a proposal before an annual meeting
of the Corporation shall continue to be subject,  to the extent  applicable,  to
the requirements of Section 14(a) of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, and
the regulations thereunder, as well as the requirements of this Section 8.

                                    DIRECTORS

SECTION 1.  Number.  The  business  and  property  of the  Corporation  shall be
conducted and managed by a Board of Directors  consisting of not less than three
(3) or more than fourteen (14) members, none of whom need be a stockholder.

The Board of Directors of the  Corporation  shall initially be composed of three
(3) directors,  but the Board may at any time by resolution increase or decrease
the number of directors to not more than  fourteen  (14) or less than three (3).
The vacancies resulting from any such increase in the Board of Directors,  or an
increase  resulting  from an  amendment  of this  Section,  shall be  filled  as
provided in Section 3 of this ARTICLE III.

SECTION 2. Term of Office.  Except as  otherwise  provided by law such  director
shall hold office until the next annual meeting of  stockholders,  and until his
successor  is  duly  elected  and  qualified  or  until  his  earlier  death  or
resignation.

SECTION 3. Vacancies.  If any vacancy shall occur among the directors, or if the
number of directors  shall at any time be  increased,  the  directors in office,
although less than a quorum,  by a majority vote may fill the vacancies or newly
created directorships,  or any such vacancies or newly created directorships may
be filled by the  stockholders at any meeting.  When one or more directors shall
resign from the Board of  Directors,  effective  at a future date, a majority of
the directors then in office,  including those who have so resigned,  shall have
power to fill such  vacancy or  vacancies,  the vote thereon to take effect when
such resignation or resignations  shall become  effective,  and each director so
chosen shall hold office as herein provided in the filling of other vacancies.

SECTION 4.  Meetings.  Meetings of the Board of Directors  shall be held at such
place  within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be fixed
by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board,  or the
CEO as may be  specified  in the  notice or waiver of notice of any  meeting.  A
regular meeting of the Board of Directors may be held without notice immediately
following  the annual  meeting of  stockholders  at the place  where such annual
meeting is held.  Regular  meetings of the Board may also be held without notice
at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of
the Board of Directors.

Special  meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the
Board,  the CEO or the  Secretary  and shall be called by the  Secretary  on the
written request of two members of the Board of Directors.  Notice of any special
meeting  shall be given to each  director at least (a) twelve (12) hours  before
the meeting by  telephone  or by being  personally  delivered  or sent by telex,
telecopy,  telegraph,  or similar means or (b) three (3) days before the meeting
if  delivered  by mail to the  director's  residence or usual place of business.
Such notice shall be deemed to be delivered  when deposited in the United States
mail so addressed,  with postage prepaid,  or when transmitted if sent by telex,
telecopy,  telegraph or similar means. Neither the business to be transacted at,
nor the purpose of, any special  meeting of the Board of  Directors  needs to be
specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

Members of the Board of Directors may  participate in a meeting of such Board by
means of  conference  telephone or similar  communication  equipment by means of
which  all  persons  participating  in the  meeting  can hear  each  other,  and
participation in the meeting pursuant hereto shall constitute presence in person
at such meeting.

Any director may waive notice of any meeting by a writing signed by the director
entitled  to the notice and filed with the  minutes or  corporate  records.  The
attendance at or  participation  of the director at a meeting  shall  constitute
waiver of notice of such  meeting,  unless the director at the  beginning of the
meeting  or  promptly  upon his  arrival  objects  to  holding  the  meeting  or
transacting business at the meeting.

SECTION 5. Quorum. A majority, but not less than two (2), of the directors shall
constitute a quorum for the  transaction  of business.  If at any meeting of the
Board of  Directors  there  shall be less than a quorum  present,  a majority of

than  announcement  of the  adjournment  at the meeting,  and at such  adjourned
meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted  which might
have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

SECTION 6.  Compensation.  The directors may be paid their expenses,  if any, of
attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, a fixed sum for attendance
at each  meeting of the Board of Directors  and/or a stated fee as director.  No
such payment  shall  preclude any director from serving the  Corporation  in any
other  capacity and receiving  compensation  therefor.  Members of the Executive
Committee  and/or of other  committees  may be  allowed  like  compensation  and
reimbursement of expenses for attending committee meetings.

SECTION 7.  Chairman.  From its  members,  the Board of  Directors  will elect a
chairman to preside  over  meetings of the  shareholders  and of the Board.  The
Chairman may simultaneously serve as any Officer of the Corporation set forth in
Article V. The Board may elect one or more Vice Chairmen.  In the absence of the
Chairman  or a Vice  Chairman,  if any,  the Board  shall  designate a person to
preside  at such  meetings.  The  director's  fee of the  Chairman  and the Vice
Chairman, if any, will be set by the Board.

SECTION 8. Director  Nominations.  Nominations for the election of directors may
be made by the Board of  Directors or a  nominating  committee  appointed by the
Board of  Directors  or by any  stockholder  entitled to vote in the election of
directors  generally.  However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election
of  directors  generally  may  nominate  one or more  persons  for  election  as
directors at a meeting only if written  notice of such  stockholder's  intent to
make such nomination or nominations has been given,  either by personal delivery

and of the person or  persons to be  nominated:  (b) a  representation  that the
stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the  Corporation  entitled to vote
at such  meeting  and  intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to
nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all
arrangements or understandings  between the stockholder and each nominee and any
other person or persons  (naming  such person or persons)  pursuant to which the
nomination  or  nominations  are to be made by the  stockholder;  (d) such other
information  regarding  each nominee  proposed by such  stockholder  as would be
required to be included in a proxy  statement  filed pursuant to the proxy rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission as then in effect; and (e) the consent
of each  nominee to serve as a director of the  Corporation  if so elected.  The
presiding officer of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any
person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.

SECTION 9. Director Stock Ownership in the Corporation. Each director elected or
appointed  to the Board of  Directors  shall own  shares of common  stock of the
Corporation.  On and after the third annual anniversary of a director's election
or  appointment  to the Board of Directors,  each  director  shall own shares of
common stock of the Corporation having a fair market value of not less than 200%
of the amount of the Board of Directors' annual retainer as then in effect.

of the  Corporation  shall be evidenced by a  certificate  or  certificates  for
shares of stock in such form as may be  prescribed  from time to time by law and
by the Board of Directors.  The  certificates  of stock of each class and series

Treasurer of the Corporation,  and may be  countersigned  and registered in such
manner as the Board of Directors  may  prescribe,  and shall bear the  corporate

of any such Chairman of the Board, CEO,  President,  Vice President,  Treasurer,

be  facsimiles  engraved or printed.  In case any officer or officers  who shall
have signed,  or whose facsimile  signature or signatures shall have been placed
upon,  such  certificate or certificates  shall have ceased to be such,  whether
because  of  death,  resignation  or  otherwise,   before  such  certificate  or
certificates  shall  have  been  issued  and  delivered,   such  certificate  or
certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered with the same effect as if
such  officer or officers had not ceased to be such at the date of its issue and
delivery.

SECTION 2. Transfer of Shares.  The shares of the stock of the Corporation shall
be transferred  on the books of the  Corporation by the holder thereof in person
or by his attorney  lawfully  constituted,  upon surrender for  cancellation  of
certificates  for the same  number of shares,  with an  assignment  and power of
transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, with such proof or
guaranty of the  authenticity  of the signature as the Corporation or its agents
may reasonably require. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of
record  of any  share or  shares  of stock as the  holder  in fact  thereof  and
accordingly  shall not be bound to recognize  any equitable or other claim to or
interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person  whether or not
it shall have express or other  notice  thereof,  except as otherwise  expressly
provided by law.

SECTION 3. Closing of Transfer  Books and Record  Dates.  The Board of Directors
may in its  discretion  prescribe in advance a period not  exceeding  sixty (60)
days prior to the date of any meeting of the  stockholders  or prior to the last
day on which the consent or dissent of stockholders may be effectively expressed
for any  purpose  without a meeting,  during  which no  transfer of stock on the
books of the  Corporation may be made; or in lieu of prohibiting the transfer of
stock, may fix in advance a time not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date
of any meeting of  stockholders or prior to the last day on which the consent or
dissent of stockholders  may be effectively  expressed for any purpose without a
meeting, as the time as of which stockholders  entitled to notice of and to vote
at such a meeting or whose  consent or dissent is required  or may be  expressed
for any purpose,  as the case may be, shall be  determined;  and all persons who
were  holders  of  record of  voting  stock at such time and no others  shall be
entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their consent or
dissent,  as the case may be,  notwithstanding  any transfer of any stock on the
books of the Corporation after any record date fixed as aforesaid.  The Board of
Directors may also, in its discretion, fix in advance a date not exceeding sixty
(60) days preceding the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or the making
of any distribution,  or for the delivery of evidence of rights, or evidences of
interests arising out of any issuance, change, conversion or exchange of capital
stock, as a record date for the  determination of the  stockholders  entitled to
receive or participate in any such dividend, distribution,  rights or interests,
notwithstanding  any transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after
any record date fixed as  aforesaid,  or, at its option,  in lieu of so fixing a
record date,  may  prescribe in advance a period not  exceeding  sixty (60) days
prior to the date for such  payment,  distribution  or delivery  during which no
transfer of stock on the books of the Corporation may be made.

SECTION 4. Lost or Destroyed Certificates. In case of the loss or destruction of
any  outstanding  certificate of stock, a new certificate may be issued upon the
following conditions:

The owner of said  certificate  shall file with the Secretary of the Corporation
an affidavit  giving the facts in relation to the ownership,  and in relation to
the loss or destruction of said  certificate,  stating its number and the number
of shares  represented  thereby;  such  affidavit to be in such form and contain
such  statements as shall  satisfy the Chairman of the Board and Secretary  that
said  certificate  has  been  accidentally  destroyed  or  lost,  and that a new
certificate  ought to be issued in lieu thereof.  Upon being so  satisfied,  the
Chairman of the Board and  Secretary  shall  require such owner to file with the
Secretary a bond in such penal sum and in such form as they may deem  advisable,
and with a surety or sureties  approved by them,  to indemnify and save harmless
the  Corporation  from  any  claim,  loss,  damage  or  liability  which  may be
occasioned by the issuance of a new certificate in lieu thereof, or if they deem
it appropriate,  to waive the  requirement to secure a bond with a surety.  Upon
such bond being so filed, a new  certificate for the same number of shares shall
be issued to the owner of the certificate so lost or destroyed; and the transfer
agent and registrar of stock,  if any, shall  countersign  and register such new
certificate  upon receipt of a written  order signed by the said Chairman of the
Board and  Secretary,  and  thereupon  the  Corporation  will save harmless said
transfer  agent and registrar in the  premises.  The CEO or the President or any
Vice President may act hereunder in the stead of the Chairman of the Board,  and
an Assistant  Secretary in the stead of the Secretary.  In case of the surrender
of the original certificate, in lieu of which a new certificate has been issued,
or the  surrender  of  such  new  certificate,  for  cancellation,  the  bond of
indemnity  given as a  condition  of the  issue of such new  certificate  may be
surrendered.  A new certificate may be issued without requiring any bond when in
the judgment of the Board of Directors it is proper to do so.

        are terminated by the Company, your rights to receive a bonus will be at

        the remaining months of the year. Example: Retirement date is August 10.
        Bonus calculations would include actual results thru July 31 and the
        latest budgeted numbers from August thru December. The bonus calculated,
        which will be an annual bonus, will then be prorated for the partial

        Stock Price percentage will be calculated using only actual results to
        the nearest end of the month for this year and last year.  The amount
        will be paid to you or the legal representative of your estate.

        stock price increases, based on the average daily closing price for 1998
        and 1999.

        b.   If Tandy's average daily closing stock price outperforms the "Peer
        Group's" average daily closing stock price, you will receive an
        additional bonus of $.

           Income and Earnings Per Share will be calculated excluding the effect
           of Financial Accounting Standards requirements i.e. FAS121.
           Percentages shall be calculated to two decimal points.

           Your factors to be used for each of the calculations  above are as
           follows:

               1.  Income  increase:  $

               2.  Earnings per share increase:  $

               3.  Stock price increase: $

                                               Minimum Increase %
                                               ------------------
               1.  Income

               2.  Earnings per share

               3.  Stock price
                    a.  Tandy Stock Increase

        Bonus  amounts  earned from each of the factors which exceed the Minimum
        Increase  above will be  accumulated.  No bonus will be paid  unless the
        accumulated bonus exceeds % of your base salary.

        Bonus will only be paid on each goal which exceeds the Minimum  Increase
        % set forth above.

IV.     Maximum Bonus:

        The bonus paid will be limited to an amount not to exceed $.

V.      This compensation plan is not an employment contract, but a method of
        calculating your total earnings.  You forfeit your rights to receive a
        bonus if you resign before the end of the current Fiscal year.  If you
        are terminated by the Company, your rights to receive a bonus will be at
        the sole discretion of the Company and in such amount as the Company
        might decide.  If you retire at age 55 or over, provided the Company has
        given its consent to your early retirement, or die before the end of the
        then current fiscal year, your bonus will be calculated using actual
        results to the nearest end of the month preceding or succeeding such
        event, which will then be adjusted using the latest budget to include
        the remaining months of the year. Example: Retirement date is August 10.
        Bonus calculations would include actual results thru July 31 and the
        latest budgeted numbers from August thru December. The bonus calculated,
        which will be an annual bonus, will then be prorated for the partial
        year worked i.e. 7/12 times annual bonus calculated in this example. The
        Stock Price percentage will be calculated using only actual results to
        the nearest end of the month for this year and last year.  The amount
        will be paid to you or the legal representative of your estate.

   VI. If at any time during your  continued  employment,  your  responsibility,
       duties or title changes,  this plan is subject to revision or termination
       by the Company at the time of the foregoing  change. A partial year bonus
       will be calculated using the methodology set forth in paragraph V.
