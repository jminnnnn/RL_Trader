PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL
Tandy Corporation, a Delaware corporation,  was incorporated in 1967 ("Tandy" or
the "Company").  The Company engages in the retail sale of consumer  electronics
including  personal  computers,  primarily in the United  States.  Sales derived
outside  of the  United  States  are  not  material.  Tandy's  principal  retail
operations in 1998 included the RadioShack(R) and Computer City(R) store chains.

    RadioShack.  RadioShack is the Company's largest operating business unit. At
    December 31, 1998, the  RadioShack  division  operated  5,039  company-owned
    stores  located   throughout   the  United  States.   These  stores  average
    approximately 2,200 square feet in gross area and are located in major malls
    and strip centers,  as well as individual  store fronts.  RadioShack had, on
    the same date,  a network of 1,991  dealer/franchise  stores.  These  stores
    provide  RadioShack  products  to  smaller  communities.   The  dealers  are
    generally  engaged in other retail  operations  and augment their sales with
    RadioShack  products.  This  network  included 53  international  dealers at
    December 31, 1998.

    The  company-owned  RadioShack  stores  carry a broad  assortment  of mostly
    private  label  electronic  parts  and   accessories,   cellular,   PCS  and
    conventional  telephones,  audio  and  video  equipment,  digital  satellite
    systems,  personal  computers and related  products,  as well as specialized
    products  such as  scanners,  electronic  toys and  hard-to-find  batteries.
    RadioShack  also provides  consumers  access to third party services such as
    cellular  phone,  PCS,  direct  satellite  programming  and  pager  service.
    RadioShack,  through its "Sprint Store at  RadioShack",  provides  customers
    with access to wireless and  residential  telephones  and related  telephony
    products and services. A second "store-within-a-store"  concept was launched
    in early 1998, when the Company announced its strategic alliance with Compaq
    Computer Corporation ("Compaq").

    Computer City. On June 22, 1998, the Company  announced that it had signed a
    definitive  agreement  to sell 100% of the  outstanding  common stock of its
    Computer City, Inc.  subsidiary  ("CCI" or "Computer  City") to CompUSA Inc.
    ("CompUSA").  The sale was completed August 31, 1998. (See "Sale of Computer
    City,  Inc." in Item 7  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Results of
    Operations and Financial Condition" ("MD&A")). Prior to the sale, there were
    101  Computer  City  stores  open,  including  seven  in  Canada.  Operating
    primarily  as a  supercenter  format,  the average  store size  approximated
    21,050 square feet in gross area and offered approximately 4,000 products in
    its  merchandising  assortment,  including  personal  computer  hardware and
    software and related  products and  accessories.  To complement its hardware
    and software  sales,  Computer  City also offered such services as classroom
    and on-site  training  for  widely-used  software  applications,  as well as
    repair,  maintenance,  custom  configuration,  diagnostic testing,  computer
    upgrades and other  technical  services on all major brands of computers and
    related products.

    Incredible Universe.  In December 1996, the Company announced its  intent to
    exit the Incredible Universe business. All Incredible Universe  stores  were
    closed  or  sold  by  the  end  of  1997.  See   "Provisions  for   Business
    Restructuring and Asset Impairment" in MD&A for further discussion.

Supporting the retail operations is an extensive infrastructure that includes:

    A&A International, Inc.("A&A") - This wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
    serves the wide-ranging international import/export,  sourcing,  evaluation,
    logistics  and  quality  control  needs of the  Company.  A&A also  provides
    services for outside customers, primarily InterTAN, Inc. ("InterTAN").  Most
    of A&A's activity for InterTAN involves sourcing of goods from manufacturers
    in Asia.

    Consumer   Electronics   Manufacturing   -  The   Company   operates   seven
    manufacturing facilities in the United States and one overseas manufacturing
    operation  in China,  which is a joint  venture.  These eight  manufacturing
    facilities  employed  approximately 3,400 employees as of December 31, 1998.
    The Company  manufactures  a variety of  products,  primarily  sold  through
    RadioShack,  including audio,  video,  telephony,  antennas,  wire and cable
    products and a wide variety of "hard to find" parts for consumer  electronic
    products.

    Tandy Service Centers-The Company maintains a service and support network to
    service the consumer  electronics  and personal  computer retail industry in
    the U.S. At December 31, 1998,  there were 53 Tandy  Service  Centers in the
    U.S. which  repaired  name-brand and private label products sold through the
    Company's retail distribution  channels.  The Company is a vendor-authorized
    service provider for such leading  manufacturers as Compaq, Sony, Panasonic,
    Hitachi,  Hewlett-Packard,  RCA/Thomson  and Nokia,  among others,  and also
    performs  repairs for third-party  service centers and extended service plan
    providers under national service agreements.

    Regional  Distribution Centers - The 11 distribution centers operated by the
    Company  ship over one million  cartons each month to the  Company's  retail
    outlets.

    Tandy Transportation, Inc.-A large fleet of tractors and trailers transports
    merchandise from  manufacturers or ports of entry to the Company's  regional
    distribution centers and local distribution  facilities and also delivers to
    the Company's retail outlets.

    Tandy Customer Support - Using state-of-the-art telephone and data networks,
    Tandy Customer Support responds to more than five million calls annually for
    answers to technical questions, customer service inquiries, and direct sales
    related to RadioShack's catalog operations,  the Internet and "hard to find"
    products offered through its RadioShack Unlimited program.

SEASONALITY
As is the case with other retail  businesses,  the Company's net sales and other
revenues are greater  during the  Christmas  season than during other periods of
the year. There is a corresponding  pre-seasonal  inventory  build-up  requiring
working capital associated with the anticipated increased sales volume. See Note
24 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for quarterly data.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
Tandy owns or is licensed to use many trademarks  related to its business in the
United States and in foreign  countries.  Radio Shack,  RadioShack,  Optimus and
You've Got Questions.  We've Got Answers.  are some of the registered marks most
widely used by the Company.  Tandy believes that the RadioShack name and mark is
well-recognized  by consumers,  and that the name and mark are associated with a
high-quality  service  provider.  The Company's  manufactured  products are sold
primarily  under the RadioShack and Optimus  trademarks  which are registered in
the U.S. and many foreign countries. Tandy also owns various patents relating to
retail and support  functions and various  products  which Tandy has  previously
designed and continues to manufacture. The Company believes that the loss of the
RadioShack name and RadioShack trademarks would be material to its business, but
does not believe that the loss of any other marks would be material.

SUPPLIERS
The Company  obtains  merchandise  from a large number of  suppliers  located in
various  parts of the  world.  Alternative  sources  of  supply  exist  for most
merchandise and raw materials purchased by the Company. As the Company's product
line is diverse,  the  Company  would not expect a lack of  availability  of any
single  product or raw  material  to have a material  impact on its  operations.
Management  does not  believe  that the loss of any one  supplier  would  have a
material impact on its operations.

BACKLOG ORDERS
The Company has no material backlog of orders for the products it sells.

COMPETITION
The consumer  electronics retail business remains highly competitive,  driven by
technology and product cycles,  as well as the overall state of the economy.  In
the consumer electronics retailing business,  competitive factors include price,
product  quality,  product  features,   consumer  services,   manufacturing  and
distribution  capability and brand reputation.  The Company competes in the sale
of its products and services with department stores, mail order houses, discount
stores,  general  merchants  and gift  stores  which  sell  comparable  products
manufactured by others.  Competitors  range in size from local drug and hardware
stores to large chains and department stores.  Consumer  electronics  mail-order
companies  also  compete  with the  Company  as do a number of  competitors  via
on-line commerce on the Internet.  The products which compete with those sold by
the Company are  manufactured  by numerous  domestic and foreign  manufacturers.
Many of these products carry nationally recognized brand names or private labels
and are sold in markets common to the Company. Some of the Company's competitors
have financial resources equal to or greater than the Company's resources.

Management believes that many factors are important to its competitive position,
including  price,  quality,  service and the broad  selection of electronic  and
telecommunications  products carried at conveniently  located  RadioShack retail
outlets.  RadioShack's strategic alliances with well-recognized partners such as
Sprint Communications  Company,  Compaq Computer Corporation and DirecTV,  among
others,  allow the  Company to leverage  name brand  recognition  and  marketing
efforts  and   advertising   campaigns  as  well  as  to  create   cross-revenue
opportunities  such as repair service  income,  customer  residuals and cellular
commissions.  The Company's  utilization of trained personnel and its ability to
use national and local  advertising media are important to the Company's ability
to compete in the consumer  electronics  marketplace.  Management of the Company
believes  it is a  strong  competitor  with  respect  to  each  of  the  factors
referenced  above.   Given  the  highly   competitive  nature  of  the  consumer
electronics  retail  business,  no assurance  can be given that the Company will
continue to compete  successfully with respect to each of the factors referenced
above.  Also, in light of the  ever-changing  nature of the  electronics  retail
industry,  the Company would be adversely  affected if its  competitors  were to
offer their  products at  significantly  lower prices,  introduce  innovative or
technologically  superior  products  not yet  available to the Company or if the
Company were unable to obtain products in a timely manner for an extended period
of time.

In 1998, Tandy operated two retailing formats:  RadioShack and, until August 31,
1998,  Computer City.  Each of the Company's  retailing  formats used a distinct
path  to  the  marketplace,  based  on its  unique  customer  appeal,  marketing
strengths and margin structure:

   RadioShack: RadioShack stores offer the shopping convenience of approximately
   7,000  company-owned  and  dealer/franchise  stores  which offer high quality
   branded and private label computer,  telephony and  electronics  products and
   parts, unique selection, repair services, knowledgeable personnel, convenient
   credit   options   and   excellent    customer    service,    including   its
   "service-oriented"  approach.  In  addition  to  providing  enhanced  product
   explanation,  specially  trained  sales staff assist  customers  with service
   activation,  where  applicable,  and  selection of  appropriate  accessories.
   RadioShack has formed strategic  relationships  with key vendors in computers
   (Compaq),  "direct-to-home"  satellite (RCA,  PrimeStar,  DirecTV, and USSB),
   telecommunications  (Sprint)  and  wireless  communications  (Sprint  PCS) to
   augment  the strong  position  that it has  historically  maintained  in core
   product categories such as batteries,  communications equipment,  telephones,
   antennas and electronic components, and parts and accessories.

   Computer City, Inc.: This subsidiary operated 101 stores prior to the sale to
   CompUSA.  Computer City stores  offered  approximately  4,000  different name
   brand items,  competitive  prices and excellent  customer service on personal
   computer  hardware  and  software,  as  well  as  accessories,  printers  and
   peripherals.  The stores averaged  approximately 21,050 square feet. Although
   retail sales were the largest  component  of Computer  City's  business,  its
   stores also fulfilled other  functions,  including direct sales to corporate,
   government  and  education  customers,  as  well  as  software  training  and
   technical services.

See "Segment  Reporting  Disclosures"  in MD&A for 1998, 1997 and 1996 net sales
and  operating  revenues,   operating  profit  (loss)  and  capital  assets  for
RadioShack and Computer City.

EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 1998, the Company had approximately  38,200  employees.  That
number included  approximately  6,500 temporary  retail employees who were hired
for the Christmas selling season. None of the Company's employees are covered by
collective   bargaining  agreements  nor  are  they  members  of  labor  unions.
Management of the Company  considers its  relationship  with its employees to be
good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
Information on the Company's  properties is in MD&A and the financial statements
included  in this  Form  10-K  and is  incorporated  herein  by  reference.  The
following items are discussed further on the referenced pages:

                                                  Page
Retail Outlets...............................      12
Property, Plant and Equipment................      45
Leases.......................................      48

The Company leases, rather than owns, most of its retail facilities.  RadioShack
stores are located primarily in major shopping malls,  stand-alone  buildings or
shopping centers owned by other entities.  The Company owns most of the property
on which its executive  offices are located in downtown Fort Worth,  Texas,  all
distribution  centers,  except  for  two  which  are  leased,  and  most  of its
manufacturing   facilities  located  throughout  the  United  States.  A&A,  the
Company's import/export  subsidiary,  leases eight administrative offices in the
Asia  Pacific  region.  Existing  warehouse  and  office  facilities  are deemed
adequate to meet the Company's needs in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
Tandy has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties,  investigations
and pending  actions  involving  allegations  of  negligence,  product  defects,
discrimination,  infringement of intellectual property rights, tax deficiencies,
violations  of permits or  licenses,  and breach of contract  and other  matters
against the  Company  and its  subsidiaries  incident  to the  operation  of its
business.  The  liability,  if  any,  associated  with  these  matters  was  not
determinable at December 31, 1998.  Although  occasional adverse  settlements or
resolutions may occur and negatively  impact earnings in the year of settlement,
it is the opinion of management  that their ultimate  resolution will not have a
materially adverse effect on Tandy's financial position.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
No  matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders  during the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 1998.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  AND
        FINANCIAL CONDITION ("MD&A").

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
With the  exception of  historical  information,  the matters  discussed in MD&A
contain forward-looking  statements that involve various risks and uncertainties
and are  indicated  by  words  such  as  "anticipates",  "expects",  "believes",
"plans",  "could", and similar words and phrases. Factors that could cause Tandy
Corporation's  ("Tandy" or the "Company")  actual  results to differ  materially
from management's  projections,  forecasts,  estimates and expectations include,
but are not limited to, the following:

o   changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity exerted by current
    competitors  and  potential  new  competition  from both  retail  stores and
    alternative  methods or channels of  distribution,  such as  electronic  and
    telephone shopping services and mail order;
o   changes in general U.S. or regional U.S. economic conditions  including, but
    not limited to, consumer credit  availability,  interest  rates,  inflation,
    personal  discretionary  spending  levels  and  consumer sentiment about the
    economy in general;
o   the  presence  or  absence  of  new  products  or  product  features  in the
    merchandise categories the Company sells and changes in the Company's actual
    merchandise sales mix;
o   the inability to negotiate profitable contracts with service providers;
o   the inability to collect the level of anticipated residuals and  commissions
    for products and services sold by the Company's RadioShack division;
o   lack of  availability  or access to sources of supply  inventory (as a large
    importer  of  consumer  electronic  products  from Asia,  unfavorable  trade
    imbalances could negatively affect the Company);
o   the inability to retain and grow an effective  management  team in a dynamic
    environment or changes in the cost or  availability of a suitable work force
    to manage and support the Company's service-driven operating strategies;
o   the potential negative impact of Year 2000 issues; or
o   the  imposition of new  restrictions  or  regulations  regarding the sale of
    products  and/or  services  the  Company  sells,  changes  in tax  rules and
    regulations applicable to the Company.

Additionally, as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the deregulated
telecommunications  market  will  continue  to present  both  opportunities  and
increased  competition  for the  provision of  telecommunication  equipment  and
services to consumers.

STOCK SPLIT
On August 21, 1997,  the  Company's  Board of Directors  declared a  two-for-one
split of Tandy common stock,  payable on September 22, 1997.  All  references to
the number of shares of common stock issued or  outstanding,  per share  prices,
cash  dividends,  income per common  share  amounts and any other  reference  to
shares,  unless  otherwise  noted,  have been adjusted to reflect the split on a
retroactive basis.

SEGMENT REPORTING DISCLOSURES
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  ("SFAS") No. 131,  "Disclosures  about  Segments of an Enterprise and
Related  Information".  All  references to RadioShack  and Computer City in MD&A
refer to the Company's reportable segments, unless otherwise noted.

The RadioShack  segment includes the RadioShack  retail division and its related
retail support  operations.  The Computer City segment  includes  Computer City,
Inc. ("CCI" or "Computer City"),  until its sale to CompUSA Inc.  ("CompUSA") on
August 31, 1998,  and, in the prior year's  information,  the five Computer City
Europe  stores sold by the Company in the fourth  quarter of 1997.  Transactions
between  operating  segments  are not common and the  amounts  included  are not
material  to the segment  information.  The closed  units/restructuring  segment
includes  all Tandy  stores and  non-retail  units  which were part of the store
closure  plan  announced  in  December  1996  (see   "Provisions   For  Business
Restructuring and Asset Impairment"  below).  The corporate  administration  and
other segment includes corporate units which serve all areas of the Company and,
also,  income or expenses which are not allocated to the RadioShack and Computer
City segments.

Summarized  in the  table  below  are  the net  sales  and  operating  revenues,
operating profit (loss) and assets for the Company's reportable segments for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CALENDAR 1998 COMPARED WITH CALENDAR 1997
- -----------------------------------------

NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES

Consolidated  net sales and  operating  revenues  decreased  10.9% from $5,372.2
million in 1997 to $4,787.9  million in 1998;  this  decrease  was  attributable
primarily  to the  sale  of  Computer  City  to  CompUSA  on  August  31,  1998.
Consolidated comparable store sales for 1998 are not meaningful, due to the sale
of Computer City.

RadioShack Segment
- ------------------

Sales for the RadioShack segment in 1998 increased 8.7% to $3,591.2 million from
$3,303.9  million in 1997, due primarily to a 7.4%  comparable  store sales gain
and the opening of 67 new stores, net of store closures. RadioShack's comparable
store  sales  increase  was driven  primarily  by  increased  sales of  wireless
communication and telephony  products and services.  A continued healthy economy
and a strong retail  consumer  electronics  industry are expected to result in a
comparable   store  sales  gain  for  1999.  The  following   table   summarizes
RadioShack's  retail  sales  breakdown  by class of products and each class as a
percent of total RadioShack  retail sales  (excluding  outside sales from retail
support operations):

(1) Computer  accessories  have been  reclassified  in the prior  years from the
    personal   computers  category  to  the  electronic  parts  and  accessories
    category.
(2) Includes  residuals,  prepaid wireless  airtime,  repair income and extended
    service contracts.

Electronic  parts,  accessories  and specialty  equipment,  the largest  product
category of RadioShack's  retail sales mix,  decreased 1.5 percentage  points in
1998 when  compared  to 1997,  despite a 4.1%  increase  in dollar  sales.  This
decrease as a percent of retail sales was  primarily  due to the  communications
and services categories becoming a higher percent of the product mix in 1998.

The  communications  category  increased  to 28.5% of retail sales from 27.5% in
1997.  Dollar  sales of the  category  increased  13.2%  over  last  year.  This
category,  which  includes  wireless  communications  such as  cellular  and PCS
telephones,  as well as residential telephones,  answering machines,  pagers and
other related telephony products,  continues to benefit from the Sprint Store at
RadioShack  launched in  September  1997.  This  "store-within-a-store"  concept
provides  customers  with access to a full  service  communications  center that
offers, where available, Sprint local and long-distance telephone service, Spree
SM prepaid phone cards and Sprint branded residential telephones.  Additionally,
RadioShack  earns  commissions from cellular  carriers for activating  customers
with cellular services. Sales of communication products are expected to continue
to grow in 1999.

Sales of audio and video products declined to 15.5% of retail sales in 1998 from
16.8% of retail sales in 1997, primarily due to the overall shift in the product
mix to communications and services. Sales dollars were flat from the prior year,
due in part to RadioShack's limited selection of name brand products. RadioShack
plans to announce a strategic  alliance with a  well-recognized  audio and video
manufacturer  in the second quarter of 1999,  which  management  believes should
improve  sales in this  category.  The audio and video  category  also  includes
"direct-to-home" satellite sales, which includes digital satellite systems (DSS)
and Primestar satellite television services. Sales of these systems and services
increased significantly over the prior year.

Personal  electronics  and seasonal  products  decreased to 10.4% of  RadioShack
retail sales in 1998 from 11.6% in 1997,  due  primarily to an overall  shift in
the product mix to communications  and services.  The sales decreases since 1996
are also  attributable  to sales  declines in such items as boomboxes,  cassette
products and toys,  other than remote control cars.  This trend is indicative of
lower general consumer demand for these products.  In 1999,  RadioShack plans to
expand its  marketing  efforts in this category by  advertising  gift items year
round, as well as by offering a broader selection of products.

On February 25,  1998,  RadioShack  entered  into a multi-year  retail sales and
service  agreement  with  Compaq  Computer  Corporation  ("Compaq").  Under this
agreement,  Compaq became the sole supplier of personal  computers  sold through
RadioShack  retail outlets via a  "store-within-a-store"  concept similar to the
Sprint Store at RadioShack.  Despite a large unit gain and a 5.8% sales gain for
this  category for 1998,  the personal  computer  category  decreased to 9.1% of
RadioShack  retail  sales  in 1998  from  9.4%  in  1997.  RadioShack  computers
experienced a 32% decline in the average 1998 selling price of desktop computers
from the 1997 annual average selling price.  Aggressive  pricing  strategies put
into place as RadioShack  transitioned  from IBM to Compaq branded computers and
products  during the first six months of 1998 and general selling price declines
in the  personal  computer  industry  contributed  to this  decline.  Management
believes that the downward  trend in selling  prices of personal  computers will
continue  in 1999,  but to a lesser  extent  than  seen in  1998.  Despite  this
downward  trend,  RadioShack  believes  that the higher  unit  sales  volumes of
personal  computers  will  contribute to increased  sales of higher gross margin
products and services,  such as accessories and extended  service plans, as well
as to  increased  customer  traffic  to the store.  Additionally,  in the fourth
quarter of 1998,  RadioShack launched the Compaq  "Built-For-You"  program which
enables  consumers  to  custom-configure  personal  computers  at  their  nearby
RadioShack store with convenient direct shipment to their home, office or nearby
RadioShack store.

Sales in the services and other  category,  which  includes  residuals,  prepaid
wireless  airtime,  repair income and extended service  contracts,  increased in
1998 in dollars and as a percent of RadioShack  retail sales, due to an increase
in  residual  income  received  from  RadioShack's   third  party  providers  of
communication and "direct-to-home"  satellite products and services,  as well as
to a large increase in sales of prepaid  wireless  airtime.  Residual  income is
earned  on  sales  of  Sprint  long   distance  and  PCS   services,   sales  of
"direct-to-home"  satellite programming and sales of other wireless products and
services. Residuals vary by service provider, but are typically a portion of the
continuing  service  revenue  throughout the ensuing months and/or years of that
customer's subscription.  In 1998, RadioShack earned approximately $34.2 million
of  residual  income,  compared  to $7.9  million  in 1997.  Residual  income is
expected to continue to increase in 1999; however,  increases are dependent upon
such factors as customers'  continued usage of certain services and stability of
average revenue per subscriber,  among other factors.  Prepaid  wireless airtime
sales are expected to continue to increase in 1999.

Computer City Segment
- ---------------------

Computer City's overall sales  decreased 37.1% to $1,196.7  million in 1998 from
1997, due to the sale of this subsidiary to CompUSA on August 31, 1998.

For the  eight  months  ended  August  31,  1998,  sales of  personal  computers
decreased  in dollars due to a  reduction  of  approximately  25% in the average
selling  price of desktop and notebook  computers  from the same period in 1997.
Additionally,  both overall and comparable stores sales were negatively impacted
by the  announced  sale of Computer  City to CompUSA on June 22, 1998,  at which
time Computer City took promotional  mark-downs to sell both its third-party and
private-label inventory in preparation for the sale to CompUSA.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross  profit for the  Company  was  $2,004.4  million or 41.9% of net sales and
operating  revenues in 1998,  compared with $2,014.3  million or 37.5%, in 1997.
This  increase  in gross  profit as a  percentage  of net  sales  and  operating
revenues was primarily the result of RadioShack  sales  accounting  for a larger
portion of the Company's  consolidated net sales and operating revenues in 1998,
when  compared to 1997due to the sale of Computer  City to CompUSA on August 31,
1998. Computer City had an inherently lower gross margin than RadioShack.

RadioShack's  gross profit  increased in dollars for the year ended December 31,
1998 versus 1997, but decreased as a percentage of  RadioShack's  total sales by
0.6  percentage  points  over the same  period.  This  percentage  decrease  was
primarily  due to a shift  within  RadioShack's  product  offerings to increased
sales of prepaid wireless airtime,  which has a significantly lower gross margin
than the overall  RadioShack  average gross margin.  This decrease was partially
offset by an increase in residual  income which has close to 100% gross  margin.
Gross  profit for  RadioShack  is expected to increase in dollars in 1999 due to
expected  sales  volume  increases  in both  products  and  services,  including
residual  income  and  sales of  prepaid  wireless  airtime.  Gross  profit as a
percentage  of  RadioShack's  sales,  however,  is expected to decrease in 1999,
similar to 1998, because of increased sales of prepaid wireless airtime.

Computer  City's  gross  profit  as a  percent  of  Computer  City net sales and
operating  revenues  decreased 2.3 percentage points for the year ended December
31, 1998 when  compared to 1997.  This  decrease was primarily due to aggressive
marketing  of  inventory,   especially   private-label  branded  inventory,   in
preparation for the sale of the subsidiary.

</TABLE>

The  Company's  SG&A expense was flat in dollars,  but increased as a percent of
net sales and operating  revenues to 33.0% for the year ended  December 31, 1998
versus 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 1997. The higher SG&A percentage is
due primarily to RadioShack becoming a larger percentage of Tandy's consolidated
operations during 1998 (see "Gross Profit" above). RadioShack operates at higher
relative SG&A expense  levels than  consolidated  Tandy  Corporation.  Excluding
Computer City and closed units associated with the 1996 restructuring plan, SG&A
expense  as a  percentage  of sales  would  have been  37.7% for the year  ended
December 31, 1998 versus 38.9% for the year ended December 31, 1997.

Although  payroll and  commissions  expense for 1998 remained flat in dollars in
comparison  with 1997,  this cost  increased  as a  percentage  of net sales and
operating  revenues  from  13.7% in 1997 to  15.3%  in 1998,  due in part to the
increase  in  RadioShack  sales as a  percentage  of  total  Company  sales  and
operating revenues, as described above.  RadioShack has inherently higher salary
expense  as  a  percentage  of  sales,  when  compared  to  consolidated   Tandy
Corporation.  To a lesser extent,  payroll  expense was  negatively  impacted by
higher payroll costs  associated with  infrastructure-building  at CCI, prior to
its announced sale in June 1998.

Advertising  expense  increased both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales
and operating  revenues,  in the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the
year ended  December 31, 1997.  This  increase  over the prior year is primarily
attributable to increased advertising expense at Computer City in 1998, compared
to 1997.  Somewhat offsetting this increase was a dollar decrease in advertising
expense at RadioShack in 1998 from 1997. In 1997, however,  the marketing launch
of the Sprint Store at RadioShack resulted in increased  advertising expense for
that year. In 1999, advertising expense in dollars for RadioShack is expected to
be comparable to or slightly more than 1998.

Rent expense decreased in dollars in comparison with 1997 and increased slightly
as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues to 4.5% in 1998 from 4.1% in
1997.  This  increase is related to the sale of Computer  City,  which had lower
rent expense as a percentage of sales than consolidated Tandy Corporation.  Rent
expense in dollars for RadioShack  increased in 1998 compared to the prior year,
but  decreased  slightly  as a percent of sales.  Rent  expense  in dollars  for
RadioShack is expected to increase  slightly in 1999,  due to new store openings
and lease renewals at slightly higher rates.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

On February 1, 1997,  in an effort to reduce the  turnover  rate among its store
managers and to align the store managers'  interests and goals with those of the
shareholders,  the  Company  granted,  under  the  1993  Incentive  Stock  Plan,
approximately 2,041,200 restricted stock awards consisting of 400 shares each to
4,907  RadioShack  store  managers and 800 shares each to 98 Computer City store
managers.  The restricted  stock awards had a weighted average fair market value
of $22.59 per share when  granted.  This  restricted  stock vested at the end of
five years on February 2, 2002, if the Company  employed the managers at a store
manager or higher position,  at that time. However, the grants provided that the
restricted  shares could vest early if the Company's  common stock closed at $33
13/16 or more for any 20  consecutive  trading days after  February 1, 1999.  At
December  31, 1998,  it was probable  that the  1,289,600  shares that  remained
outstanding under this grant would vest under the early vesting provisions.  The
resulting  charge to compensation  expense of $82.6 million,  including  related
payroll taxes, was recorded in the December 31, 1998 financial statements.

Vesting of these  restricted  stock awards  occurred when the  Company's  common
stock closed above the targeted amount for the twentieth consecutive trading day
on March 1, 1999.  Vesting  resulted in the issuance of 1,272,000  shares of the
Company's  common  stock  at a fair  market  value  of  $56.09  per  share.  The
difference  between the December 31, 1998 accrual for  compensation  expense and
the actual expense when vested will be recorded in the first quarter of 1999.

On February 1, 1998, the Company  granted,  under the 1997 Incentive Stock Plan,
approximately  324,750  restricted stock awards consisting of 250 shares each to
1,299  RadioShack  store  managers  not  included in the  February 1, 1997 grant
described  above. The restricted stock awards had a weighted average fair market
value of $39.22 per share when granted.  This restricted  stock will vest at the
end of five years on February 2, 2003, if the Company  employs the managers at a
store manager or higher position, at that time. However, the grants provide that
the restricted  shares could vest early if the Company's  common stock closes at
$58 1/8 or more for any 20  consecutive  trading  days after  February  1, 2000.
Compensation  expense,  equal to the fair market  value of the  shares,  will be
recognized over the remaining  vesting period when it becomes  probable that the
performance  criteria will be met or upon actual vesting.  At December 31, 1998,
there were 222,000 restricted stock awards outstanding and eligible for ultimate
vesting pursuant to this restricted stock award.

The  Company  does not plan to  continue  granting  restricted  stock  awards to
RadioShack  store managers.  See "1999 Incentive Stock Plan" below regarding the
February 1999 grant of stock options to RadioShack store managers.

SALE OF COMPUTER CITY, INC.

On June  22,  1998,  the  Company  announced  that it had  signed  a  definitive
agreement with CompUSA for the sale of 100% of the  outstanding  common stock of
the Company's Computer City, Inc.  subsidiary.  On August 31, 1998, the sale was
completed.  The  Company  received  approximately  $36.5  million in cash and an
unsecured  subordinated  note for $136.0 million as consideration  for the sale.
The note, which is of equal priority with CompUSA's existing  subordinated debt,
bears  interest  at 9.48%  per  annum  and is  payable  over a ten year  period.
Interest  is payable  on June 30 and  December  31 of each year,  with the first
payment  made on December 31,  1998.  Beginning on December 31, 2001,  principal
payments will be due  semiannually  until the note matures on June 30, 2008. The
Company  recognized a loss of $108.2 million from the sale of CCI in 1998, which
included  certain  liabilities  and  contractual  obligations  incurred  by  the
Company.  Although no  significant  additional  provisions  are expected in 1999
relating to the sale of CCI, unexpected contractual requirements associated with
the  sale,  among  other  factors,  could  result  in  additional  charges.  The
management of the Company  believes that the sale of CCI will enable it to focus
exclusively on the growth potential of RadioShack.

Net sales and operating  revenues,  operating losses and restructuring and other
charges for  Computer  City for each of the three  years  ended  December 31 are
presented below:

(2) As  described  more fully in  "Provisions  for  Business  Restructuring  and
    Asset Impairment" below, during the fourth  quarter of 1996 Tandy elected to
    close 21   unprofitable  stores.   CCI  recognized  a  restructuring  charge
    aggregating $14.8 million associated with these closings.The charges related
    primarily to lease obligations and employee termination expenses.  CCI  also
    recognized asset impairment charges aggregating   $18.7  million during 1996
    and  lower  of  cost  or  market impairments aggregating approximately $20.7
    million  related to inventory liquidated at the affected stores.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE

The  accompanying  table below  summarizes the breakdown of interest  income and
interest expense:

                                                  Year Ended December 31,

                                             --------     --------     --------

Net interest expense                         $  (34.6)    $  (32.9)    $  (23.4)
                                             ========     ========     ========

Net interest  expense was $34.6  million for 1998 versus $32.9 million for 1997.
Interest expense decreased slightly during 1998, due to a corresponding decrease
in the  Company's  average  debt  outstanding  during 1998 as well as to a small
decrease in short-term interest rates for the year.

Interest  income  decreased in 1998 due to the repayment of the  InterTAN,  Inc.
("InterTAN")  note  receivable  on December 31, 1997.  On August 31, 1998,  the
Company received a note from CompUSA for $136.0 million with an interest rate of
9.48% per annum. Interest income relating to the Fry's Electronics, Inc. and its
affiliates ("Fry's") notes receivables resulted from the 1997 sale of assets and
real estate of six Incredible Universe stores. At December 31, 1998, the Company
held multiple notes receivable from Fry's totaling  approximately  $47.6 million
(see "Provisions for Business Restructuring and Asset Impairment" below).

Assuming the existing  interest rate  environment  remains stable,  net interest
expense is  expected to  decrease  during  1999,  primarily  due to  anticipated
interest income of $12.9 million on the CompUSA note receivable.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

The  provision  for income  taxes  reflects an  effective  tax rate of 38.5% for
fiscal years 1998 and 1997. The Company  expects the effective tax rate for 1999
to increase  slightly to 39.0%,  due  primarily to an increase in the  effective
state tax rate, which results from a higher percentage of income being earned in
states with higher tax rates.

CALENDAR 1997 COMPARED WITH CALENDAR 1996
- -----------------------------------------

NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES

Consolidated  net sales  and  operating  revenues  decreased  14.5% to  $5,372.2
million in 1997 from  $6,285.5  million in 1996,  attributable  to Tandy's store
closure plan  announced in December  1996. For the year ended December 31, 1997,
the Company showed a 2.0% comparable store sales increase over fiscal 1996.

RadioShack Segment
- ------------------

Sales for the RadioShack segment in 1997 increased 4.5% to $3,303.9 million from
$3,160.5  million  in 1996,  adjusted  for  stores  closed  under the 1996 store
closure plan,  due to positive same store sales gains and the opening of 108 new
stores,  net of RadioShack store closures.  RadioShack's  comparable store sales
increase  was 1.9% for the year ended  December 31,  1997,  driven  primarily by
increased  sales of wireless  communication  and  telephone  products.  Sales of
electronic  parts,  accessories  and specialty  equipment,  the largest  product
category of RadioShack's sales mix in 1997, remained relatively  consistent with
the prior year; however, the category as a percentage of RadioShack retail sales
decreased   as  sales  of   communications   products   increased   16.7%.   The
communications category increased to 27.5% of RadioShack retail sales from 24.4%
in 1996. This category benefited from the successful rollout of the Sprint Store
at RadioShack in September 1997.  Sales of audio and video products  declined to
16.8% of retail sales in 1997 from 18.0% in 1996, due to lower  consumer  demand
for these products and the heightened level of competition  within the industry.
Offsetting  the decline in audio and video sales was a 7.0%  increase in 1997 of
"direct-to-home" satellite system sales, despite a substantially reduced average
selling price of digital satellite  systems.  Personal  electronics and seasonal
products  decreased  to 11.6% of retail  sales in 1997 from  12.4% in 1996,  due
primarily  to an overall  shift in the product mix to  communications.  Personal
computer  sales  decreased  as a percentage  of total  retail  sales  despite an
overall unit gain for 1997,  due to a 17.8% decrease in the average 1997 selling
price on desktop  and  notebook  computers  from 1996.  The  services  and other
category  increased in 1997 due to residual  income  received from  RadioShack's
third party providers of communication and "direct-to-home"  satellite products,
as well as an increase in income from prepaid wireless airtime.

Computer City Segment
- ---------------------

Computer City's overall sales in 1997 increased  10.6% to $1,903.7  million from
$1,721.6 million in 1996, adjusted for the 21 stores closed pursuant to the 1996
store closure plan.  Computer City's  comparable  store sales increased 2.2% for
the year ended  December  31, 1997.  The overall  sales  increase was  primarily
attributable  to positive  same store sales plus  revenues  generated  by 14 new
stores  opened in 1996.  In stores  open at least  one year,  sales of  personal
computers were up slightly in 1997 due to a significant increase in direct sales
to corporate,  education and government  customers.  This increase was offset by
the decrease in the annual average  selling price of retail  desktop  computers,
which fell approximately  15.0% from the 1996 annual average selling price. To a
lesser extent, a decrease in sales of non-DOS machines in 1997 also impacted the
personal  computers sales increase.  Product  categories which experienced sales
and unit increases in 1997 included  scanners,  which  benefited from both lower
selling  prices  and  new  technology,  as  well  as  notebook  computers  which
experienced  a large  increase in both sales  dollars  and unit sales.  Sales of
software,  accessories  and supplies also  experienced  positive sales growth in
1997.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross  profit for the Company was  $2,014.3  million,  or 37.5% of net sales and
operating revenues,  in 1997, compared with $2,022.4 million, or 32.2%, in 1996.
This  increase  in gross  profit as a  percentage  of net  sales  and  operating
revenues was  primarily  due to  RadioShack  sales  accounting  for 61.5% of the
Company's  total sales and operating  revenues in fiscal year 1997,  compared to
50.3% in fiscal  year  1996;  this  occurred  as a result of the  closure of the
Incredible Universe stores in early 1997 and, to a lesser extent, the closure of
21 Computer  City  stores at December  31,  1996.  Excluding  stores in the 1996
closure  plan and  excluding  the 1996  fourth  quarter  lower of cost or market
inventory  impairment,  the slight decline in the Company's  gross profit margin
from  38.8% in 1996 to  38.4%  in 1997  resulted  primarily  from the fact  that
RadioShack's  1997  percentage  sales  increase  was less than  Computer  City's
percentage sales increase. Computer City had inherently lower gross margins than
RadioShack.

RadioShack's gross profit as a percentage of RadioShack sales increased slightly
for the year ended December 31, 1997 versus 1996, due to a positive shift within
RadioShack's  product  offerings  to increased  cellular  and  telecommunication
sales,  as a percent of sales,  and was further  enhanced by decreased  sales of
lower margin personal computers.

Computer City's gross profit for continuing stores as a percent of Computer City
sales  increased 0.9  percentage  points in 1997 when  compared to 1996,  due to
improvement  in  inventory   management,   increased   sales  of  higher  margin
accessories  and  software  and an increase in the ratio of service  revenues to
total  revenues.  Service  revenues  typically  have a higher  gross margin than
merchandise sales.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

The  Company's  SG&A  expense as a percent of net sales and  operating  revenues
increased for the year ended  December 31, 1997 to 29.4% from 28.0% for the year
ended  December  31,  1996.  The higher SG&A  percentage  was due  primarily  to
RadioShack,  which became a larger percentage of Tandy's consolidated operations
during 1997 (see "Gross Profit" above).  RadioShack  operated at higher relative
SG&A expense levels than consolidated Tandy Corporation.  Excluding those stores
in the 1996 store closure plan, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales would have
approximated  29.5% for the year ended  December 31, 1997. See  "Provisions  for
Business Restructuring and Asset Impairment" below.

Although  payroll  and  commissions  expense  for 1997  decreased  in dollars in
comparison with 1996, this cost increased as a percentage of sales and operating
revenues from 12.1% in 1996 to 13.7% in 1997,  due to the increase in RadioShack
sales as a percentage of total sales and  operating  revenues  described  above.
RadioShack  has  inherently  higher  salary  expense  as a  percentage  of total
RadioShack sales when compared to the total Company.  RadioShack payroll expense
increased in dollars and as a percentage of  RadioShack  sales in 1997 from 1996
due to increased staffing at the store level. Computer City payroll expense as a
percentage  of  Computer  City  sales  increased  from  1996 to 1997  due to the
addition of new stores in 1997,  added  headcount in the direct sales area and a
realignment of support staff from Tandy Corporation to Computer City.

Advertising expense decreased,  both in dollars and as a percentage of sales and
operating  revenues,  in 1997 as compared to 1996.  This decrease over the prior
year was primarily the result of reductions in Incredible  Universe  advertising
in 1997, due to stores closed pursuant to the 1996 restructuring  plan. Computer
City had a  substantial  increase  in vendor  participation  in its  advertising
campaigns in 1997 compared to 1996.  Somewhat  offsetting  these decreases was a
slight  dollar  increase in  advertising  expense at  RadioShack  to promote the
Sprint  "store-within-a-store"  concept,  which was launched in September  1997.
RadioShack  advertising  expense as a  percentage  of  RadioShack  sales in 1997
remained constant with 1996.

Rent expense  increased  as a  percentage  of sales to 4.1% in 1997 from 3.8% in
1996. This increase was related to a decrease in the number of Computer City and
Incredible Universe stores which had lower rent expense as a percentage of sales
than the Company as a whole. Rent expense in dollars decreased in 1997 from 1996
due to Incredible Universe and Computer City store closures pursuant to the 1996
restructuring  plan.  Rent expense for RadioShack  remained  consistent with the
prior year in dollars and decreased slightly as a percentage of sales.

Credit card fees expense,  which includes fees  associated with third party bank
credit cards and fees paid for  promotional  accounts such as "zero interest for
six  months",  decreased as a result of the closure of the  Incredible  Universe
stores and decreased usage by RadioShack during 1997.

Other SG&A expense  decreased  both as a percentage  of net sales and  operating
revenues  and in dollars when  compared to fiscal year ended  December 31, 1996.
Increases in other  income were  primarily  attributable  to the receipt of $9.0
million,  pre-tax, of income from O'Sullivan Industries ("O'Sullivan") (see "Tax
Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement  Agreement" below) and non-recurring gains
of $4.7 million  recorded on repayment of the note  receivable from InterTAN and
$3.0  million  on sale  of  certain  assets.  These  increases  were  offset  by
additional  restructuring expense of the $11.6 million related to store closings
pursuant to the 1996 store closure plan.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE

Net interest  expense was $32.9  million for 1997 versus $23.4  million in 1996.
Interest expense increased in 1997 as the Company continued  purchasing treasury
stock and continued to fund store  expansion.  Interest  expense also  increased
during  1997  when  the  Company  refinanced  existing  short-term  indebtedness
(average  maturity  of 90 days or less) by issuing  $150.0  million of  ten-year
unsecured notes, resulting in a moderately higher interest rate when compared to
the short-term financing used in 1996.

Interest  income  relating to the InterTAN  notes  decreased in 1997 as InterTAN
made the scheduled  principal payments on the note balances.  The remaining note
was repaid in December 1997. In addition,  the $90.0 million AST Research,  Inc.
("AST") note was repaid in 1996 and, accordingly, the Company no longer received
interest income from this source in 1997.  Interest income relating to the Fry's
notes  receivables  resulted from the 1997 sale of assets and real estate of six
Incredible  Universe  stores.  At December 31, 1997,  the Company held  multiple
notes  receivable  from  Fry's  of  approximately  $75.3  million  with  varying
maturities  ranging  from one to five  years and  interest  rates  ranging  from
approximately 5.9% to 6.7%.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

The  provision  for income  taxes  reflects an  effective  tax rate of 38.5% for
fiscal year 1997,  compared to an effective tax rate of 37.1% for the comparable
period in fiscal year 1996. The fiscal 1997 effective tax rate differed from the
fiscal  1996  effective  tax rate  primarily  because  the fiscal  1996 tax rate
included  foreign income taxes which were incurred on foreign income despite the
overall loss incurred by the Company.

PROVISIONS FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT
In the fourth quarter of 1996, Tandy initiated certain restructuring programs to
exit its  Incredible  Universe  business,  close 21  unprofitable  Computer City
stores and close its 53 remaining McDuff stores.  These  restructuring  programs
were  undertaken  as a  result  of the  highly  competitive  environment  in the
electronics  industry.  The Company  recorded  total  pre-tax  charges of $162.1
million  in 1996  related  to  future  lease  obligations,  real  estate  costs,
disposition  of  fixed  assets,   employee  termination  expenses  and  contract
cancellation  costs  related to this  restructuring  program.  The Company  also
recognized,   in  1996,  lower  of  cost  or  market   impairments   aggregating
approximately  $91.4 million,  pre-tax,  primarily related to inventory that was
liquidated at the affected stores.  Inventory impairment charges were recognized
in the  Consolidated  Statements  of Income as an  increase  in cost of sales in
1996. The Company also recognized a non-cash  impairment charge of $86.8 million
to write down the carrying values of long-term  assets pursuant to SFAS No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of" ("FAS 121") as part of the restructuring plan.

Upon adoption of FAS 121 in the first quarter of 1996, the Company recognized an
initial non-cash  impairment loss of approximately $26.0 million to conform with
this  statement,  primarily as a result of grouping  long-lived  assets at their
lowest  level  of  cash  flows  to  determine  impairment  as  required  by this
statement.

In January  1997,  the Company  closed the  respective 53 McDuff and 21 Computer
City stores.  Additionally,  by July 1997, all of the Incredible Universe stores
were either closed or sold.  During 1997, the Company sold the assets related to
several  closed  stores,  including  the sale of the real estate,  related fixed
assets and  inventory  of six  Incredible  Universe  stores to Fry's.  These six
stores were sold for  approximately  $21.5  million in cash and $97.4 million in
notes  receivable  with no material  gain or loss  recognized  upon the sale. At
December 31, 1998, the notes receivable balance was $47.6 million with remaining
interest rates ranging from 6.6% to 6.7% and maturity dates in 2001 and 2002. In
1997,  additional  costs totaling  $11.6 million  related to store closings were
recorded  and  included  in  SG&A  expense  in  the  accompanying   Consolidated
Statements of Income.

On January 1, 1998, five closed Incredible Universe locations  remained.  During
1998,  three were sold for a total of $13.3  million in cash and a $3.0  million
note  receivable.  The balance on the note  receivable  was  approximately  $3.0
million at December 31, 1998. The lease on an additional location was terminated
during 1998, leaving one Incredible  Universe location remaining at December 31,
1998.  In 1998,  $6.5  million  was  accrued  and  charged to SG&A  expense  for
additional lease obligations and real estate costs.

The components of the  restructuring  charge and an analysis of the reserves are
outlined in a table in Note 5 - "Provisions for Business Restructuring and Asset
Impairment"  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  ("Notes").
Although no significant  additional  provisions are expected in 1999 relating to
the 1996  restructuring,  unexpected delays in the closing of real estate sales,
among other factors, could result in additional charges.

Net sales and  operating  revenues  and  operating  losses of the stores  closed
pursuant to the restructuring plans are shown below for each year ended December
31 (unaudited):

TAX SHARING AND TAX BENEFIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
Under the Company's  Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit  Reimbursement  Agreement  (the
"Agreement")  with  O'Sullivan  Industries,  a former  subsidiary of Tandy,  the
Company receives payments from O'Sullivan  approximating the federal tax benefit
that  O'Sullivan  realizes from the increased tax basis of its assets  resulting
from the initial  public  offering  completed in February  1994.  The higher tax
basis increases  O'Sullivan's  tax deductions and,  accordingly,  reduces income
taxes payable by  O'Sullivan.  For the years ended  December 31, 1998,  1997 and
1996,  the Company  recognized  income of $6.0  million,  $5.8  million and $0.2
million,  net of tax,  respectively,  under this Agreement.  These payments will
continue  to be  made  over a  15-year  time  period  and  are  contingent  upon
O'Sullivan's  level of earnings  from year to year.  The income is recorded as a
reduction of SG&A expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",  which  is
effective  for all companies for quarters  beginning  after June 15, 1999.  This
statement requires a company to record all derivative  instruments at fair value
on the balance  sheet.  The Company  does not use  derivatives  for  speculative
purposes.  As such, its market risk was not material in 1998 and is not expected
to be material in 1999.

CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY

                                            Year Ended December 31, 
                                     ----------------------------------        
(In millions)                          1998         1997         1996
- -------------                        --------     --------     --------
Operating activities                 $  414.8     $  320.3     $  307.5
Investing activities                    (93.0)       (63.9)      (112.9)
Financing activities                   (363.2)      (272.0)      (216.6)

In 1998, cash flow provided by operating activities approximated $414.8 million,
compared  to $320.3  million in 1997.  Cash flow from net income,  adjusted  for
non-cash items including restricted stock awards, loss on sale of Computer City,
depreciation and deferred tax items,  decreased $33.1 million from 1997 to 1998.
This  decrease was primarily  due to the  increased  operating  losses of CCI in
1998,  prior to CCI's sale to CompUSA.  During 1998,  changes in working capital
generated  $55.2 million of cash flow compared to a use of cash of $72.4 million
in  1997.  The  increase  was  caused  primarily  by the  liquidation  of  CCI's
inventories.

In 1997, cash flow from operations  before working capital changes  increased to
approximately  $392.7  million  from  $258.3  million in 1996,  due to  improved
operating  performance.  For 1997,  the Company used $72.4  million in cash from
operations due to changes in working capital accounts, primarily attributable to
a decrease in other current liabilities of $209.6 million, related, for the most
part, to resulting expenditures associated with the 1996 restructuring activity.
Substantially  offsetting the decreased cash flow from  expenditures  related to
restructuring was a decrease in inventory at closed Incredible Universe stores.

In 1996, the working capital  components of operations cash flow generated $49.2
million  of  positive  cash  flow  from a  $38.1  million  increase  in  current
liabilities.  In 1996,  inventory for RadioShack and related support  operations
decreased  approximately $30.0 million,  while during the same period,  Computer
City and Incredible Universe  inventories (prior to the restructuring  reserves)
increased approximately $30.1 million. These year-to-year inventory fluctuations
offset one another, resulting in no material net cash effect for 1996.

Investing  activities  used  $93.0  million in cash in 1998,  compared  to $63.9
million in 1997 and $112.9 million in 1996.  Capital  expenditures  approximated
$131.5 million in 1998, compared to $118.4 million in 1997 and $174.8 million in
1996.  Capital  expenditures  for 1998 and 1997 were used  primarily  for retail
expansion,  upgrading information systems and infrastructure  enhancements prior
to the announced  sale of CCI on June 22, 1998.  Capital  expenditures  for 1996
were  primarily used for retail  expansion,  upgrading  information  systems and
headquarter   building   renovations.   Management   anticipates   that  capital
expenditure  requirements  for 1999 will  approximate  $100.0  million to $110.0
million,  and will consist  primarily of RadioShack  future store expansions and
remodels,   upgrades  of   machinery  in  selected   distribution   centers  and
manufacturing plants and updated information systems. These expenditures will be
funded  primarily from  operating cash flow.  Cash proceeds from the sale of CCI
generated  $36.5  million in cash in 1998.  Cash  proceeds in 1997 totaled $57.4
million  and  related  to the  sale of  various  corporate  assets  and  certain
Incredible  Universe  locations,  final  repayment of the note  receivable  from
InterTAN and the sale of the Company's remaining shares of AST common stock. The
cash portion of payments on the AST note receivable amounted to $60.0 million in
1996.

Cash used by financing activities was $363.2 million in 1998, compared to $272.0
million and $216.6 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively. Purchases of treasury
stock  required cash of $337.4  million,  $425.6  million and $232.9  million in
1998,  1997 and  1996,  respectively.  (See  "Capital  Structure  and  Financial
Condition"  below for further  information  on the  Company's  stock  repurchase
programs.) The 1998, 1997 and 1996 stock  repurchases  were partially  funded by
$57.8  million,  $50.7 million and $46.8  million,  respectively,  received from
stock option  exercises and the sale of treasury stock to Tandy's employee stock
purchase  plans.  Dividends paid, net of tax, in 1998, 1997 and 1996 amounted to
$44.8  million,  $48.2 million and $52.5  million,  respectively.  In 1998,  the
Company  used excess cash flow to decrease  its  short-term  debt from the prior
year by $44.9  million.  Medium-term  notes issued by the Company under its 1997
Debt Shelf Registration  Statement provided  approximately $45.0 million in cash
in 1998, the majority of which was used to repay current maturities of long-term
debt. In 1997,  the Company's  short-term  debt increased over the prior year by
$43.6  million.  The Company's  net change in long-term  debt was an increase of
$107.5 million, due to the utilization of $150.0 million of long-term debt under
the Company's $300.0 million Debt Shelf Registration Statement and the repayment
of $42.3 million of long-term borrowings, primarily medium-term notes.

The current credit ratings for Tandy, which are generally considered  investment
grade, follow:

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
The Company's balance sheet and financial  condition  continue to be strong. The
Company's available borrowing facilities as of December 31, 1998 are detailed in
Note 10 - "Indebtedness and Borrowing Facilities" of the Notes.

On March 3, 1997, the Company  announced that its Board of Directors  authorized
management to purchase an additional 10.0 million shares, as adjusted to reflect
the two-for-one  split, of its common stock through the Company's existing share
repurchase  program.  The share repurchase  program was initially  authorized in
December  1995 and  increased in October 1996 and was  undertaken as a result of
management's  view of the  economic  value of the  Company's  stock.  The  share
increase for 1997 brought the total  authorization  to 30.0 million  shares,  of
which 25.9  million  shares  totaling  $745.8  million had been  purchased as of
December 31, 1998. Approximately 4.9 million shares were repurchased in 1998 for
$216.6 million under the program. Additionally, on October 26, 1998, the Company
announced  that its Board of Directors  authorized  the  repurchase of up to 5.0
million shares of the Company's common stock for an indefinite period of time to
be used to offset the dilution of grants  under  Tandy's  incentive  stock plans
(see Note 17 - "Stock Options and Performance Awards" in Notes). These purchases
are in addition to the shares  required  for  employee  stock  plans,  which are
purchased throughout the year. Purchases will continue to be made in 1999 in the
open  market.  It is expected  that funding of the program will come from excess
free cash flow.

In connection  with the share  repurchase  program,  the Board of Directors,  at
their October 23, 1998 meeting,  authorized management to sell up to one million
put options on the Company's common stock.  During 1998, the Company sold 80,000
put options with a strike price of $40.71 to an  independent  third party.  Such
options grant the purchaser the right to sell shares of Tandy's  common stock to
the Company at specified prices upon exercise of the options.  These put options
are  exercisable  only at maturity  and can be settled in cash at the  Company's
option,  in lieu of  repurchasing  the  stock.  The issued  put  options  have a
maturity of six months.  At  December  31,  1998,  all 80,000  options  remained
outstanding  and the full  redemption  value of the  options was  classified  as
common stock put options in the accompanying  1998  Consolidated  Balance Sheet.
The related  offset was recorded in common  stock in  treasury,  net of premiums
received.  Additionally,  200,000 put  options  have been sold in 1999 at strike
prices ranging from $45.08 to $55.20;  these put options have six month maturity
dates.  Put options will continue to be sold by the Company from time to time in
order to take  advantage of  attractive  share price  levels,  as  determined by
management.  The timing  and terms of the  transactions,  including  maturities,
depend on market conditions, the Company's liquidity and other considerations.

The Company's primary source of short-term debt consists of short-term  seasonal
bank debt and commercial  paper,  which have maturities of less than 90 days. In
the second quarter of 1998,  Tandy  replaced its existing  $500.0 million credit
facilities with new credit  facilities,  also totaling  $500.0 million.  The new
facilities were granted by a syndicate of 17 banks,  including a new agent bank,
and consist of a $200.0 million 364-day  revolving credit facility maturing June
1999 and a $300.0 million  five-year  revolving  credit  facility  maturing June
2003.  The revolving  credit  facilities  are used as backup for the  commercial
paper program and may also be utilized for general  corporate  purposes.  Annual
commitment fees for the facilities are 0.06% of the $200.0 million  facility per
annum and 0.085% of the $300.0  million  facility  per  annum,  whether  used or
unused. Tandy plans to extend the $200.0 million facility to June 2000.

The total  debt-to-capitalization ratio was 35.6% at December 31, 1998, 33.6% at
December  31,  1997 and 22.3% at  December  31,  1996.  These  increases  in the
debt-to-capitalization  ratios  in  1998  and  1997  resulted  primarily  from a
reduction in Tandy's  stockholders'  equity due to the share repurchase  program
and the impact of divested businesses.

In May  1997,  the  Company  filed a  $300.0  million  Debt  Shelf  Registration
Statement ("Shelf  Registration")  with the Securities and Exchange  Commission,
which was declared  effective in August  1997.  On August 19, 1997,  the Company
issued $150.0 million of 10 year unsecured  notes under the Shelf  Registration.
The  interest  rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum  with  interest  payable  on
September 1 and March 1 of each year,  commencing  March 1, 1998.  The notes are
due September 1, 2007.

In December 1997, the Company issued $4.0 million in medium-term notes under the
Shelf  Registration.  In January 1998,  the Company  issued an additional  $45.0
million in  medium-term  notes under the remaining  $150.0  million of the Shelf
Registration. Tandy's medium-term notes outstanding at December 31, 1998 totaled
$49.8  million,  compared to $30.0  million at December 31,  1997.  The interest
rates at December  31, 1998 for the  outstanding  $49.8  million in  medium-term
notes ranged from 6.09% to 7.25%, with weighted average coupon rates of 6.2% and
8.2% at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. An additional $32.0 million of
medium-term notes were issued in January 1999 yielding a 6.15% interest rate. As
of February 24, 1999,  the Company had remaining  availability  of $69.0 million
under the Shelf Registration.

Management  believes that the Company's  present  borrowing  capacity is greater
than the established  credit lines and long-term debt in place.  Management also
believes that the Company's cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents
and its available  borrowing  facilities  are more than adequate to fund planned
store expansion,  to meet debt service and dividend requirements and to fund its
share repurchase program.

1999 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN
In February 1999, the Company, based upon the Board of Directors' authorization,
adopted the Tandy  Corporation  1999  Incentive  Stock Plan ("1999 ISP"),  which
authorizes  the grants of stock options and stock  appreciation  rights to broad
based employee groups and other eligible  employees.  Grants of restricted stock
and  performance  awards are not  authorized  under the 1999 ISP.  In  addition,
repricing of outstanding options is not permitted without shareholder  approval.
The 1999 ISP will be  administered  as a broadly  based  plan to  provide  stock
option  incentives  primarily to the Company's  5,000 plus store managers and to
other eligible  employees of the Company.  A total of 4.75 million shares of the
Company's common stock was reserved for issuance under the 1999 ISP.

The Board granted  approximately  1,082,000  stock options under the 1999 ISP at
fair market value on February 24, 1999 to over 5,000  RadioShack  store managers
employed as of that date.

INFLATION
Inflation has not significantly  impacted the Company over the past three years.
Management does not expect inflation to have a significant  impact on operations
in the foreseeable  future,  unless global situations  substantially  affect the
world economy.

YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE
The Company's  management  recognizes  the need to take action to reach its goal
that its  operations  and  relationships  with key vendors,  service  providers,
customers  and other third  parties will not be  adversely  impacted by software
processing errors arising from calculations using the Year 2000 and beyond. Like
many  companies,  a  significant  number of Tandy's  computer  applications  and
systems  require  modifications  in order for these  systems to be ready for the
Year 2000.  All  statements  made and  referred to here are Year 2000  Readiness
Disclosures under the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.

The Company's  State of Readiness:  Tandy is using a combination of internal and
external  resources to identify,  assess,  remediate and test its many different
information  technology ("IT") systems such as point of sale,  payroll,  credit,
purchase   ordering,    merchandise    distribution,    management    reporting,
manufacturing,  mainframe, and client/server applications, as well as its non-IT
systems  (e.g.  heating,  ventilating  and air  conditioning  systems,  building
security systems, etc.).

Since  beginning the project in 1995, the Company has completed  identifying and
assessing  100% of its internal  mid-range  and  mainframe IT  applications  and
approximately 80% of its data  communication and  telecommunication  systems for
Year 2000 readiness.  An inventory and assessment of the Company's workstations,
which includes desktop and notebook  computers,  will be completed in the second
quarter of 1999.  As of December  31,  1998,  remediation  and unit  testing was
approximately  90% complete  for  mid-range  and  mainframe  applications.  Unit
testing  ensures the accuracy of the  programming  changes to the code. For data
communication and  telecommunication  systems,  remediation and unit testing was
approximately  75%  complete as of December  31, 1998 and is expected to be 100%
complete by September 30, 1999.  Remediation  and testing to determine if all of
the Company's mission critical systems will interface and operate effectively to
process data  containing  dates  subsequent to January 1, 2000 for all remaining
servers, systems software and personal computers are expected to be completed by
the third quarter of 1999.

Third-party  software systems,  including  financial systems,  point-of-sale and
manufacturing have been or will be implemented during 1999. The vendors of these
third-party  software  packages  have  stated  that  they are Year  2000  ready;
however, the Company has and/or intends to conduct its own testing in 1999.

With  respect  to  non-IT  system  issues,  the  Company  is in the  process  of
identifying,  assessing and remediating,  if necessary, its building and process
and  production  control  systems  for any  Year  2000  issues  relating  to the
operations of its facilities.  Identification and assessment of security access,
building  control  systems and  elevators  in the  buildings  which serve as the
Company's  corporate  headquarters  have  been  completed  and  remediation  was
approximately  60% complete at December 31, 1998.  The Company is in the process
of identifying and assessing Year 2000 issues of its remote  locations,  such as
its distribution centers,  manufacturing plants, and administrative  offices and
does not expect any  significant  issues to arise from this process.  All of the
Company's non-IT systems are expected to be Year 2000 ready by the third quarter
of 1999.

Although  unforeseen  circumstances may arise, the Year 2000 remediation program
is presently on schedule.  The Company will continue  communicating with its key
suppliers, utilities, financial institutions,  customers and others to determine
their state of Year 2000 readiness,  to coordinate Year 2000  conversions  where
appropriate and to determine the extent to which the Company's interface systems
are vulnerable.

Costs: In management's opinion, the financial impact of being Year 2000 ready is
not expected to be material to the Company's  consolidated  financial  position,
results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.   Management  anticipates  that  total
expenditures  associated  with the Year 2000 internal  modifications  will range
from $10.0  million to $14.0  million,  which has been and will  continue  to be
funded from operating cash flow. As of December 1998, approximately $6.5 million
representing  internal  payroll  and  related  benefits,  depreciation  expense,
machine time and incentive  bonuses,  among other costs, has been spent on these
internal  modifications.  An  additional  $0.5 million has been paid to external
parties for consulting and professional  fees. As required by generally accepted
accounting  principles,  all these  costs are  expensed as  incurred.  Combined,
internal  and  external  costs  related  to the Year 2000  project  account  for
approximately 7.0% of the Company's annual IT budget. Additionally,  the Company
has purchased  and is installing  third party  financial  software  packages and
related hardware totaling  approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million in light
of the Year  2000  issue.  These  purchases  are in  addition  to other  capital
investments  made in the normal  course of  business  for  certain  third  party
software  systems  and  applications   which  address  the  ongoing  retail  and
operational needs of the Company.

The  Risks  of the  Company's  Year  2000  Issues:  With  respect  to the  risks
associated  with its IT and non-IT systems,  the Company  believes that the most
reasonably  likely  worst  case  scenario  is that some of the  Company's  store
operating and inventory  management systems could fail in one or more geographic
areas of the United  States.  The  consequence of such failure could include the
inability of those affected  RadioShack  stores to  electronically  record sales
transactions.  This could further result in a breakdown in the Company's  supply
chain as the Company  relies on electronic  information to replenish its stores.
Such an  occurrence  would  result  in a loss  of  revenue;  however,  it is not
possible to quantify the possible range of such loss.

There  can be no  assurance  that the  systems  of third  parties  on which  the
Company's  systems rely will be  converted  timely and that the systems will not
have an adverse effect on the Company's systems or ongoing operations.  However,
concerning the risks  associated with third parties,  the Company  believes that
the most  reasonably  likely worst case  scenario is that some of the  Company's
merchandise  vendors will not be compliant and will have difficulty  filling and
distributing  orders.  Failure of one or more third party  service  providers on
whom the Company  relies to address  Year 2000 issues  could also  result,  in a
worst case scenario, in some business  interruption.  The lost revenues, if any,
resulting  from  such  failures  would  depend  on the time  period in which the
failure goes uncorrected and on how widespread the impact was.

The Company is also in the process of  assessing  the  implications  of possible
Year 2000-related  claims regarding  products it has manufactured or sold, or is
currently manufacturing or selling. The outcomes of any Year 2000 claims and the
impact of such claims  cannot be  determined  at this time;  such  outcomes will
depend on the facts and circumstances of each situation and an evolving state of
law as these types of claims are addressed by legal systems in the United States
and worldwide.

The Company has limited the scope of its risk  assessment  to those factors upon
which it can  reasonably  be expected to have an  influence.  For  example,  the
Company has made the  assumption  that  financial  institutions  and the Federal
Reserve System as well as most utility companies and national telecommunications
providers will continue to operate.  Obviously,  the lack of such services could
have a material effect on the Company's ability to operate,  but the Company has
little,  if any,  ability to influence  such an outcome,  or to reasonably  make
alternative  arrangements  in advance  for such  services  in the event they are
unavailable.

Contingency  Plans:  The Company has  completed  a  prioritization  of Year 2000
issues in order to develop and document Year 2000 contingency plans. The Company
has identified its critical  applications to be its  merchandising and inventory
systems,  which  include  purchasing,   receiving  and  distribution  and  store
replenishment, its point-of-sale store operating system as well as its financial
systems, which includes payroll, accounts payable and receivable and banking and
other  financial  applications.  Should any or all of the critical  applications
fail to perform properly  subsequent to January 1, 2000, the Company will resort
to  temporary  manual  processing  for  recording  sales,  ordering  product and
replenishing  the  Company's  stores,  which is not  expected to have a material
adverse  impact on its  operations  in the  short-term.  Management  anticipates
having a formal  documented  contingency  plan to deal  with  this  scenario  by
November 1999. The Company's eleven distribution  centers are located in various
geographic areas of the United States.  Should one or more of these distribution
centers  fail to operate  due to  regional  power  outages  or other  unforeseen
circumstances,  the Company's other distribution  centers which may be operating
could replenish stores typically  serviced by those  distribution  centers for a
relatively  short period of time.  Management  is in the process of  documenting
this  contingency  plan.  Although no single  internal  or third party  supplier
accounts for a material  portion of the Company's sales and operating  revenues,
management is  evaluating  the need for a formal list of  alternative  suppliers
should some existing  suppliers be unable to provide  product  beyond the end of
calendar year 1999.  Should the decision be made that such a list and agreements
with alternate suppliers be necessary,  they will be developed prior to November
1999.

All statements  concerning  Year 2000 issues other than  historical  statements,
including,  without  limitation,  estimated costs and the projected timetable of
Year 2000 compliance, constitute "forward-looking statements", as defined in the
Private  Securities   Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995.  Such   forward-looking
statements  should be read in conjunction with the Company's  disclosures  under
the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results".

ITEM 7a.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133,
"Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",  which  is
effective  for all companies for quarters  beginning  after June 15, 1999.  This
statement requires a company to record all derivative  instruments at fair value
on the balance  sheet.  The Company  does not use  derivatives  for  speculative
purposes.  As such, its market risk was not material in 1998 and is not expected
to be material in 1999.

All schedules have been omitted because they are not applicable, not required or

Separate  financial  statements of Tandy  Corporation  have been omitted because
Tandy is primarily an operating  company and the amount of restricted net assets
of  consolidated   and   unconsolidated   subsidiaries  and  Tandy's  equity  in
undistributed  earnings  of 50% or  less-owned  companies  accounted  for by the
equity method are not  significant.  All  subsidiaries of Tandy  Corporation are
included in the consolidated  financial statements.  Financial statements of 50%
or  less-owned  companies  have been  omitted  because  they do not,  considered
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a significant subsidiary.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Tandy Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index  on page 32  present  fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  financial
position of Tandy  Corporation and its subsidiaries  (the "Company") at December
31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with
generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These financial  statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management;  our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tandy Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Tandy  Corporation  ("Tandy" or the "Company") is primarily  engaged in consumer
electronics retailing principally through RadioShack's  company-owned stores and
dealer/franchise outlets.  RadioShack's sales and operating revenues are related
to  private  label  and  branded  consumer  electronics,   brand  name  personal
computers,   wireless  communication   products  and  services,   telephony  and
"direct-to-home" satellite systems. Additionally, Tandy operates certain related
retail support groups and consumer electronics manufacturing businesses.

Another retail concept,  Computer City, Inc. ("CCI" or "Computer City") was sold
effective  August 31, 1998.  Computer  City sales  related to personal  computer
hardware and  software,  printers,  peripheral  equipment and  accessories  sold
through retail locations and direct sales to corporate, government and education
customers.

In December  1996,  the Company  announced its intention to exit the  Incredible
Universe business and certain other stores (see Note 5).

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts  of Tandy and its  majority  owned  subsidiaries.  CCI was  included in
Consolidated Financial Statements through August 31, 1998, the date of its sale.
Investments  in 20% to 50%  owned  companies  are  accounted  for on the  equity
method.  The fiscal periods of certain foreign  operations end one month earlier
than the Company's year end to facilitate  their  inclusion in the  consolidated
financial statements.  Significant  intercompany  transactions are eliminated in
consolidation.

Foreign  Currency  Translation:  The functional  currency of  substantially  all
operations outside the U.S. is the respective local currency.  Translation gains
or losses related to net assets located outside the United States are shown as a
component of  comprehensive  loss,  and  classified in the equity section of the
balance sheet.

Cash and Cash  Equivalents:  Cash on hand in stores,  deposits  in banks and all
highly liquid  investments with a remaining  maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase are considered cash and cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents
are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

Marketable  Securities:  The Company had an  investment  in AST  Research,  Inc.
("AST")  common stock at December  31, 1996 which it sold in August  1997.  This
investment was classified in other current  assets in the  Consolidated  Balance
Sheet at December 31, 1996 and  categorized as "available for sale".  Securities
classified as "available  for sale" are marked to market based upon market value
fluctuations.  Resulting  adjustments,  net of deferred taxes, are reported as a
component of  stockholders'  equity until realized.  Declines in fair value that
are  considered  to be other than  temporary  are  recognized  in  earnings  and
establish a new cost basis for the security.  Realized gains and losses are also
included in earnings and are determined on the specific identification method.

Accounts  Receivable  and  Allowance  For Doubtful  Accounts:  An allowance  for
doubtful  accounts is provided when accounts are determined to be uncollectible.
Concentrations  of credit risk with respect to customer  receivables are limited
due to the large number of customers  comprising the Company's customer base and
their location in many different  geographic areas of the country;  however, the
Company does have some  concentration  of credit risk in the cellular  telephone
industry due to increased sales and outstanding balances as of December 31, 1998
from cellular telephone carriers. The increase was due primarily to RadioShack's
growth in wireless telephone sales (see Note 7).

Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally  based on
average cost) or market value and are comprised primarily of finished goods.

Property,  Plant and  Equipment:  Property and equipment are stated at cost. For
financial  reporting  purposes,  depreciation  and  amortization  are  primarily
calculated  using the  straight-line  method,  which  amortizes  the cost of the
assets over their estimated useful lives.  When  depreciable  assets are sold or
retired,  the related  cost and  accumulated  depreciation  are removed from the
accounts.   Any  gains  or  losses  are   included  in   selling,   general  and
administrative  SG&A expense.  Major additions and betterments are  capitalized.
Maintenance  and repairs which do not materially  improve or extend the lives of
the   respective   assets  are  charged  to  operating   expenses  as  incurred.
Amortization of buildings  under capital leases is included in depreciation  and
amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:  Long-lived assets (primarily  property,  plant
and equipment  and  goodwill)  held and used by the Company or to be disposed of
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss
is recognized  if the sum of the expected  future cash flows  (undiscounted  and
before  interest)  from the use of the asset is less than the net book  value of
the asset.  The  amount of the  impairment  loss is  generally  measured  as the
difference between the net book value of the assets and the estimated fair value
of the related assets.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  The fair value of financial instruments is
determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques as
appropriate.   Unless  otherwise   disclosed,   the  fair  values  of  financial
instruments  approximate  their recorded  values due primarily to the short-term
nature of their maturities or their varying interest rate.

Hedging and  Derivative  Activity:  The Company  entered into interest rate swap
agreements  in the first quarter of 1995 to manage its interest rate exposure by
effectively  trading  floating  interest  rates for fixed  interest  rates.  The
Company used the swaps to hedge certain  obligations with floating rates;  thus,
the difference  between the floating and fixed  interest rate amounts,  based on
these swap agreements,  was recorded as income or expense.  Through December 31,
1996,  the Company had entered  into five swaps with regard to notional  amounts
totaling $90.0 million.  In 1996,  the Company  terminated the underlying  lease
obligations  related to these  swaps and  recognized  a charge of $3.8  million,
which  was  the  fair  market  value  of the  swaps  at the  time  of the  lease
terminations  (see Note 5).  These  swaps  were  terminated  in March 1997 at no
material gain or loss.

Revenues:  Retail sales are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Residual  income is
typically  recognized  based upon the contractual  percentage of each customer's
monthly bill.

Extended  Service  Contracts:  Tandy's retail  operations offer extended service
contracts on products sold. These contracts  generally  provide extended service
coverage for periods of 12 to 60 months.  The Company extends service  contracts
on behalf of an unrelated  third party and, to a much lesser  extent,  sells its
own extended service contracts.  Revenues from sales of its own extended service
contracts are recognized ratably over the lives of the contracts. Costs directly
related  to  sales  of such  contracts  are  deferred  and  charged  to  expense
proportionately as the revenues are recognized. A loss is recognized on extended
service  contracts if the sum of the expected costs of providing  services under
the contracts  exceeds  related  unearned  revenue.  Commission  revenue for the
unrelated  third party extended  service  contracts is recognized at the time of
sale.

Income  Taxes:  Income  taxes are  accounted  for using the asset and  liability
method.  Deferred taxes are recognized  for the tax  consequences  of "temporary
differences" by applying enacted  statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to differences  between the financial statement and carrying amounts and the tax
basis of existing  assets and  liabilities.  The effect on deferred  taxes for a
change in tax rates is  recognized  in income in the period  that  includes  the
enactment date. In addition,  the Company  recognizes future tax benefits to the
extent that realization of such benefits are more likely than not.

Earnings Per Share:  Effective  December 31, 1997, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 128, "Earnings per Share" ("FAS
128"). FAS 128 establishes  standards for computing and presenting  earnings per
share ("EPS"). The statement requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS
on the face of the income statement for entities with complex capital structures
and requires a reconciliation  of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS
computation  to the numerator and  denominator  of the diluted EPS  computation.
Basic EPS excludes the effect of potentially  dilutive  securities while diluted
EPS reflects the  potential  dilution  that would have occurred if securities or
other contracts to issue common stock were exercised,  converted, or resulted in
the  issuance of common stock that would have then shared in the earnings of the
entity.  EPS data for the year ended  December  31,  1997 and all prior  periods
presented  herein have been  restated  to conform  with the  provisions  of this
statement.

</TABLE>

Options to purchase  1.6 million and 0.7 million  shares of common stock in 1998
and 1997, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings
per common share because the option  exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the common stock during the year. In 1996,  4.6 million  options
to  purchase  common  stock and an  additional  3.6  million  shares of Series B
preferred  stock were not included in the  computation  of diluted  earnings per
common  share  because the Company was in a loss  position  and their  inclusion
would have been antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation:  The Company adopted, on a disclosure basis only, SFAS
No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation"  ("FAS 123") in 1996. The
Company  continues to measure  compensation  costs under  Accounting  Principles
Board Opinion 25,  "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and its
related interpretations.

Advertising  Costs: All advertising  costs of the Company are expensed the first
time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense was $208.7 million, $195.4
million,  and $254.6  million for the years ended  December 31,  1998,  1997 and
1996, respectively.

Capitalized Software Costs: The Company capitalizes qualifying costs relating to
developing or obtaining  internal-use  software.  Capitalization of costs begins
after the conceptual formulation stage has been completed. Capitalized costs are
amortized over the estimated  useful life of the software,  which ranges between
three and five years.  Capitalized software costs at December 31, 1998, 1997 and
1996 totaled $27.6 million, $25.4 million, and $23.5 million, net of accumulated
amortization of $4.0 million, $5.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively.

Pervasiveness  of  Estimates:   The  preparation  of  financial   statements  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities,  and related revenues and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss
contingencies  at the date of the  financial  statements.  Actual  results could
differ from those estimates.
<PAGE>
Comprehensive Income (Loss): Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 130, "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income".  Comprehensive income is defined as
the change in equity  (net  assets) of a  business  enterprise  during a period,
except those changes  resulting from investments by owners and  distributions to
owners.

The following tables summarize the tax effects and the cumulative  amount of the
separate  components  of other  comprehensive  income (loss) for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996:

NOTE 3 - STOCK SPLIT
On September 22, 1997,  the Company  distributed  a  two-for-one  split of Tandy
common  stock.  This  resulted in the issuance of 52.7 million  shares of common
stock along with a corresponding decrease of $52.7 million in additional paid-in
capital.  Treasury shares were not split. However, an adjustment was made to the
Company's stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet to split the cost of
treasury stock (in effect a cancellation of treasury shares).  All references to
the number of shares of common stock issued or  outstanding,  per share  prices,
and income per common share amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and
the accompanying Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements ("Notes") have been
adjusted to reflect the split on a retroactive  basis.  Previously awarded stock
options,  restricted  stock  awards,  and all other  agreements  payable  in the
Company's  common  stock have been  adjusted  or  amended to reflect  the split.
Additionally, cash dividends which were $0.20 per share per quarter prior to the
two-for-one  split have been  restated at $0.10 per share per quarter to reflect
the two-for-one split.

NOTE 4 - SALE OF COMPUTER CITY, INC.
On June  22,  1998,  the  Company  announced  that it had  signed  a  definitive
agreement with CompUSA, Inc. ("CompUSA") for the sale of 100% of the outstanding
common stock of the Company's  Computer  City,  Inc.  subsidiary.  On August 31,
1998, the sale was completed.  The Company received  approximately $36.5 million
in cash and an unsecured  subordinated  note for $136.0 million as consideration
for the sale.  The note,  which is of equal  priority  with  CompUSA's  existing
subordinated  debt,  bears interest at 9.48% per annum and is payable over a ten
year period.  Interest is payable on June 30 and December 31 of each year,  with
the first  payment made on December  31,  1998.  Beginning on December 31, 2001,
principal  payments will be due semiannually  until the note matures on June 30,
2008.  The Company  recognized a loss of $108.2  million from the sale of CCI in
1998, which included certain liabilities and contractual obligations incurred by
the Company.

In connection  with the sale,  the Company  reacquired the 19.9% interest of CCI
from Eureka Venture Partners III LLP ("EVP"), which was acquired by EVP from the
Company in July 1997.  Related to the  reacquisition  of EVP's ownership in CCI,
the management  agreement with the three  principals of EVP was  terminated.  In
addition, the warrant that EVP purchased for an additional 20.1% interest in CCI
was canceled.

Net sales and operating  revenues,  operating losses and restructuring and other
charges for  Computer  City for each of the three  years  ended  December 31 are

(1) Includes  operations for only eight months, due to sale to CompUSA on August
    31, 1998.  
(2) As described  more fully in Note 5, during the fourth quarter of 1996 Tandy 
    elected to  close 21  unprofitable stores.  CCI  recognized  a restructuring
    charge aggregating $14.8 million associated with these closings. The charges
    related  primarily to lease obligations and employee  termination  expenses.
    CCI also  recognized  asset  impairment  charges  aggregating  $18.7 million
    during  1996  and  lower  of   cost  or   market   impairments   aggregating
    approximately $20.7 million related to inventory  liquidated at the affected
    stores.

NOTE 5 - PROVISIONS FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT
In the fourth quarter of 1996, Tandy initiated certain restructuring programs to
exit its  Incredible  Universe  business,  close 21  unprofitable  Computer City
stores and close its 53 remaining McDuff stores.  These  restructuring  programs
were  undertaken  as a  result  of the  highly  competitive  environment  in the
electronics  industry.  The Company  recorded  total  pre-tax  charges of $162.1
million  in 1996  related  to  future  lease  obligations,  real  estate  costs,
disposition  of  fixed  assets,   employee  termination  expenses  and  contract
cancellation  costs  related to this  restructuring  program.  The Company  also
recognized,   in  1996,  lower  of  cost  or  market   impairments   aggregating
approximately  $91.4 million,  pre-tax,  primarily related to inventory that was
liquidated at the affected stores.  Inventory impairment charges were recognized
in the  Consolidated  Statements  of Income as an  increase  in cost of sales in
1996. The Company also recognized a non-cash  impairment charge of $86.8 million
to write down the carrying values of long-term  assets pursuant to SFAS No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of" ("FAS 121") as part of the restructuring plan.

Upon adoption of FAS 121 in the first quarter of 1996, the Company recognized an
initial non-cash  impairment loss of approximately $26.0 million to conform with
this  statement,  primarily as a result of grouping  long-lived  assets at their
lowest  level  of  cash  flows  to  determine  impairment  as  required  by this
statement.

In January  1997,  the Company  closed the  respective 53 McDuff and 21 Computer
City stores.  Additionally,  by July 1997, all of the Incredible Universe stores
were either closed or sold.  During 1997, the Company sold the assets related to
several  closed  stores,  including  the sale of the real estate,  related fixed
assets and inventory of six  Incredible  Universe  stores to Fry's  Electronics,
Inc. and its affiliates ("Fry's").  These six stores were sold for approximately
$21.5  million in cash and $97.4  million in notes  receivable  with no material
gain or loss  recognized  upon  the  sale.  At  December  31,  1998,  the  notes
receivable  balance was $47.6 million with remaining interest rates ranging from
6.6% to 6.7% and  maturity  dates in 2001 and 2002.  In 1997,  additional  costs
totaling  $11.6 million  related to store closings were recorded and included in
SG&A expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

On January 1, 1998, five closed Incredible Universe locations  remained.  During
1998,  three were sold for a total of $13.3  million in cash and a $3.0  million
note  receivable.  The balance on the note  receivable  was  approximately  $3.0
million at December 31, 1998. The lease on an additional location was terminated
during 1998, leaving one Incredible  Universe location remaining at December 31,
1998.  In 1998,  $6.5  million  was  accrued  and  charged to SG&A  expense  for
additional lease obligations and real estate costs.

Net sales and  operating  revenues  and  operating  losses of the stores  closed
pursuant to the restructuring plans are shown below for each year ended December

NOTE 9 - TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On March 3, 1997, the Company  announced that its Board of Directors  authorized
management  to purchase an  additional  10.0 million  shares of its common stock
through the Company's  existing share repurchase  program.  The share repurchase
program was initially authorized in December 1995 and increased in October 1996.
The share  increase  for 1997  brought the total  authorization  to 30.0 million
shares,  of which 25.9 million shares totaling $745.8 million had been purchased
as of  December  31,  1998.  Additionally,  on October  26,  1998,  the  Company
announced  that its Board of Directors  authorized  the  repurchase of up to 5.0
million shares of the Company's common stock for an indefinite period of time to
be used to offset the dilution of grants  under  Tandy's  incentive  stock plans
(see Note 17).  These  purchases  are in  addition  to the shares  required  for
employee stock plans, which are purchased throughout the year.

In connection  with the share  repurchase  program,  the Board of Directors,  at
their October 23, 1998 meeting,  authorized management to sell up to one million
put options on the Company's common stock.  During 1998, the Company sold 80,000
put options with a strike price of $40.71 to an  independent  third party.  Such
options grant the purchaser the right to sell shares of Tandy's  common stock to
the Company at specified prices upon exercise of the options.  These put options
are  exercisable  only at maturity  and can be settled in cash at the  Company's
option,  in lieu of  repurchasing  the  stock.  The issued  put  options  have a
maturity of six months.  At  December  31,  1998,  all 80,000  options  remained
outstanding  and the full  redemption  value of the  options was  classified  as
common stock put options in the accompanying  1998  Consolidated  Balance Sheet.
The related  offset was recorded in common  stock in  treasury,  net of premiums
received.  Additionally,  200,000 put  options  have been sold in 1999 at strike
prices ranging from $45.08 to $55.20;  these put options have six month maturity
dates.

NOTE 10 - INDEBTEDNESS AND BORROWING FACILITIES
Tandy's  short-term  credit  facilities,  including  revolving credit lines, are
summarized in the accompanying  short-term borrowing facilities table below. The
method used to compute averages in the short-term  borrowing facilities table is
based on a daily weighted average computation which takes into consideration the
time period such debt was  outstanding  as well as the amount  outstanding.  The
Company's primary source of short-term debt, for which borrowings and repayments
are  presented net of each other in the  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows,
consists of short-term  seasonal bank debt and commercial  paper. The commercial
paper has a typical maturity of 90 days or less, as does the short-term seasonal
bank debt. The amount of commercial  paper that may be outstanding is limited to
a maximum of $500.0 million.

In the second quarter of 1998, Tandy replaced its existing $500.0 million credit
facilities with new credit  facilities,  also totaling  $500.0 million.  The new
facilities were granted by a syndicate of 17 banks,  including a new agent bank,
and consist of a $200.0 million 364-day  revolving credit facility maturing June
1999 and a $300.0 million  five-year  revolving  credit  facility  maturing June
2003.  The  Company  plans to extend the $200.0  million  facility to June 2000.
Annual  commitment  fees for the two  facilities are 0.06% of the $200.0 million
facility per annum and 0.085% of the $300.0 million facility per annum,  whether
used or  unused.  The  revolving  credit  facilities  are used as backup for the
commercial paper program and may be utilized for general corporate purposes.  At
December 31, 1998,  there was $179.0  million of  commercial  paper  outstanding
backed by these facilities.

On August 19,  1997,  the Company  issued  $150.0  million of 10 year  unsecured
senior  notes under a $300.0  million  Debt Shelf  Registration  Statement  (the
"Shelf Registration"),  which was effective August 6, 1997. The interest rate on
the notes is 6.95% per annum with interest payable on September 1 and March 1 of
each year,  commencing on March 1, 1998. The notes are due September 1, 2007. In
December 1997 and January 1998,  the Company issued $49.0 million in medium-term
notes under the Shelf  Registration.  The  proceeds  were used to repay  current
maturities of long-term debt. Tandy's  medium-term notes outstanding at December
31, 1998 totaled $49.8  million  compared to $30.0 million at December 31, 1997.
The interest  rates at December 31, 1998 for the  outstanding  $49.8  million in
medium-term notes ranged from 6.09% to 7.25%, with weighted average coupon rates
of 6.2% and 8.2% at December  31,  1998 and 1997,  respectively.  An  additional
$32.0 million of medium-term  notes were issued in January 1999 at a coupon rate
of 6.15%.  As of February 24, 1999,  the Company had remaining  availability  of
$69.0 million under the Shelf Registration.

At December 31, 1997, a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of Tandy had a $125.0  million
subordinated note which was repaid by Tandy on July 14, 1998.

The Company  established an employee stock ownership trust in June 1990. Further
information  on the trust and its related  indebtedness,  which is guaranteed by
the Company, is detailed in the discussion of the Tandy Fund in Note 15.

Long-term  borrowings and capital lease obligations  outstanding at December 31,
1998 mature as follows:

The fair value of the  Company's  long-term  debt of $233.7  million  (including
current portion,  but excluding capital leases) was approximately $236.7 million
at December 31, 1998.  The fair value was computed  using  interest  rates which
were in effect at December 31, 1998 for similar debt instruments.

Borrowings payable within one year are summarized in the accompanying short-term
debt table below.  Short-term  debt at December 31, 1998 consisted  primarily of
domestic seasonal borrowings.  Short-term debt at December 31, 1997 consisted of
the $125.0  million note payable and the $30.0  million  outstanding  on the CCI
revolving  credit  facility  (see  above) as well as $70.2  million in  domestic
seasonal borrowings.

NOTE 11 - LEASES AND COMMITMENTS
Tandy leases rather than owns most of its facilities.  The RadioShack(R)  stores
comprise the largest portion of Tandy's leased facilities. The RadioShack stores
are located  primarily in major  shopping  malls and shopping  centers  owned by
other  companies.  Store leases are generally  based on a minimum  rental plus a
percentage  of the store's  sales in excess of a stipulated  base figure.  Tandy
also leases distribution centers and office space. In addition, the Company also
has capital leases related to its computer and operating systems.

Future  minimum  rent  commitments  at  December  31,  1998  for  all  long-term
noncancelable  leases (net of  immaterial  amounts of sublease  rent income) are
included in the following table.

The 1996 tax rate  differed  from the 1998 and 1997 tax rates due  primarily  to
foreign  income taxes which were incurred on foreign  income despite the overall
loss incurred by the Company.

Deferred  tax assets  and  liabilities  as of  December  31,  1998 and 1997 were
comprised of the following:

or 1997.

NOTE 14 - TANDY STOCK PLAN
Eligible  employees may contribute 1% to 7% of annual  compensation  to purchase
Company  common stock at the monthly  average daily closing  price.  The Company
matches 40%, 60% or 80% of the employee's contribution,  depending on the length
of the  employee's  continuous  participation  in the Tandy Stock Plan.  Tandy's
contributions  to the Stock Plan were $14.5  million,  $13.7  million  and $14.5
million for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

NOTE 15 - TANDY FUND
On January 1, 1996,  the Tandy  Employees  Stock  Ownership  Plan  ("TESOP"),  a
leveraged  employee stock  ownership plan, was amended and merged with the Tandy
Employees Deferred Salary and Investment Plan ("DIP") and renamed the Tandy Fund
("Plan"). The Plan is a defined contribution plan. Eligible employees may direct
their  contributions into various  investment  options,  including  investing in
Company common stock.  Participants may defer, via payroll reductions,  1% to 8%
of annual  compensation.  Contributions  per  participant are limited to certain
annual maximums  permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.  Company  contributions
are  made  directly  to  the  Plan  through  the  TESOP  portion  of  the  Plan.
Participants  become fully vested in Company  contributions  upon the earlier to
occur of five years of service with the Company or three years of  participation
in the Plan.

TESOP Portion of the Plan: On July 31, 1990,  prior to its merger into the Tandy
Fund,  the trustee of the TESOP,  now the Plan,  borrowed  $100.0  million at an
interest rate of 9.34% with varying  semiannual  principal  payments due through
June 30, 2000 ("TESOP  Notes").  The Plan  trustee  used the  proceeds  from the
issuance of the TESOP Notes to purchase  100,000 shares of TESOP Preferred Stock
from Tandy at a price of $1,000 per share.  In December  1994,  the Plan entered
into an agreement with an unrelated third party to refinance up to $16.7 million
of the TESOP Notes in a series of up to six annual notes, beginning December 30,
1994.  As of  December  31,  1998,  the Plan had  borrowed  $16.2  million  (the
"Refinanced  Notes") of a possible  $16.7 million at interest rates ranging from
5.84% to 8.76% to refinance  the TESOP Notes.  The maturity  dates of these five
notes  range  from  December  2000  to  December  2002.  Dividend  payments  and
contributions  received  by the  Plan  from  Tandy  will be used  to  repay  the
indebtedness.  Each share of TESOP  Preferred  Stock is convertible  into 43.536
shares  of  Company  common  stock.  The  annual  cumulative  dividend  on TESOP
Preferred  Stock is $75.00 per share,  payable  semiannually.  Because Tandy has
guaranteed  the  repayment  of the TESOP  Notes and the  Refinanced  Notes,  the
indebtedness  of  the  Plan  is  recognized  as a  long-term  obligation  in the
accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheets. An offsetting charge has been made in
the stockholders' equity section of the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets
to reflect unearned deferred compensation related to the Plan.

Compensation and interest expenses related to the Plan before the reduction for 
the allocation of dividends are presented below for each year ended December 31:

(In millions)                1998              1997              1996
- -------------              --------          --------           --------
Compensation expense       $ 10.2            $  9.5             $  8.0
Interest expense              3.4               4.4                5.1

During the terms of the TESOP Notes and Refinanced  Notes,  the TESOP  Preferred
Stock will be allocated to the  participants  annually,  based on the total debt
service made on the  indebtedness.  As shares of the TESOP  Preferred  Stock are
allocated to Plan  participants,  compensation  expense is recorded and unearned
deferred  compensation  is  reduced.  Interest  expense  on the TESOP  Notes and
Refinanced  Notes is also  recognized  as a cost of the Plan.  The  compensation
component of the Plan  expense is reduced by the amount of dividends  accrued on
the TESOP  Preferred  Stock,  with any  dividends in excess of the  compensation
expense reflected as a reduction of interest expense.

Contributions from Tandy to the Plan for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997
and 1996 totaled $14.7 million,  $14.5 million and $11.4 million,  respectively,
including  dividends  paid on the TESOP  Preferred  Stock of $5.8 million,  $6.1
million and $6.3 million, respectively.

At December 31, 1998,  65,290 shares of TESOP  Preferred Stock had been released
and allocated to  participants'  accounts in the Plan  (including  23,029 shares
which had been withdrawn by  participants).  At December 31, 1998, an additional
10,152  shares  of  TESOP  Preferred  Stock  were  released  for  allocation  to
participants on the March 31, 1999 annual allocation date. At December 31, 1998,
24,558  shares of TESOP  Preferred  Stock were  available  for later release and
allocation  to  participants  over the  remaining  life of the  TESOP  Notes and
Refinanced  Notes.  The  appraised  value of these  shares was $44.9  million at
December 31, 1998. The TESOP Preferred Stock has certain liquidation preferences
and may be  redeemed  after  July 1,  1994,  at  specified  premiums.  

NOTE 16 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS 
In October 1997, the Board of Directors approved the Tandy Corporation Executive
Deferred  Compensation Plan and the Tandy Corporation  Executive  Deferred Stock
Plan,  which became effective on April 1, 1998. These plans permit employees who
are corporate or division  officers to defer,  on a pre-tax basis,  up to 80% of
their base salary and/or  bonuses.  Certain  executive  officers may defer up to
100% of their base salary and/or bonuses. In addition, officers are permitted to
defer any  restricted  stock or  nonstatutory  stock  option  gains  that  would
otherwise vest. Cash deferrals may be invested in Company common stock or mutual
funds; however, restricted stock and nonstatutory stock option gains may only be
invested in Company  common stock.  The Company  matches 12% of salary and bonus
deferrals in the form of Company  common  stock.  Tandy will match an additional
25% of salary and bonus  deferrals if the deferral period exceeds five years and
the deferrals are invested in Company common stock. Payment of deferrals will be
made in cash  and  Company  common  stock  in  accordance  with  the  employee's
specifications  at the time of the deferral;  payments may be received in a lump
sum or annual installments not to exceed 20 years.

NOTE 17 - STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS
The Company applies APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
stock option plans, which are described below. Historically,  the exercise price
of options has been equal to or greater  than the fair market  value on the date
of grant.

The 1993 and 1997  Incentive  Stock  Plans  shall  each  terminate  on the tenth
anniversary  of the day  preceding  the date of its adoption by the Board and no
option or award shall be granted under each plan thereafter.

Tandy  Corporation  1985 Stock Option Plan ("1985 SOP"):  Under the 1985 SOP, as
amended,  options  to  acquire up to 4.0  million  registered  shares of Tandy's
common  stock  were  authorized  to be granted to  officers  and key  management
employees of the Company. The 1985 SOP expired in 1995 and no further grants may
be made under the 1985 SOP.  Under the 1985 SOP there were  264,671  and 916,513
vested options which could have been exercised for a total price of $4.0 million
and $15.6 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Tandy  Corporation  1993 Incentive Stock Plan ("1993 ISP"): The 1993 ISP permits
the grant of up to 6.0 million  shares in the form of  incentive  stock  options
("ISOs"),  nonstatutory  stock options  (options  which are not ISOs)  ("NSOs"),
stock  appreciation  rights ("SARs"),  restricted  stock,  performance  units or
performance  shares.  Grants  of  options  under the 1993 ISP shall be for terms
specified  by the  Organization  and  Compensation  Committee  of the  Board  of
Directors  (the  "Committee"),  except  that the term shall not exceed 10 years.
Option agreements issued under the 1993 ISP generally provide that, in the event
of a change in control, all options become immediately and fully exercisable.

Under the 1993 ISP, each  non-employee  director of the Company receives a grant
of NSOs for 8,000 shares of the Company's common stock on the first business day
of September  of each year  ("Director  Options"),  unless  similar  options are
granted from any other plan.  Director Options have an exercise price of 100% of
the fair market value of the Company's  common stock on the trading day prior to
the date of grant,  vest as to  one-third  of the shares  annually  on the first
three  anniversary dates of the date of grant and expire 10 years after the date
of grant.

The exercise price of an option (other than a Director  Option) is determined by
the  Committee,  provided that the exercise price shall not be less than 100% of
the fair market  value of a share of the  Company's  common stock on the date of
grant.

Under the 1993 ISP,  there were  2,058,426  and 1,528,054  vested  options which
could have been  exercised for a total exercise price of $51.2 million and $34.8
million at December 31, 1998 and 1997,  respectively.  In addition,  at December
31, 1998 and 1997 there were 332,826 and 59,160 shares  available for additional
grants under the 1993 ISP,  respectively.  

On February 1, 1997,  in an effort to reduce the  turnover  rate among its store
managers and to align the store managers'  interests and goals with those of the
shareholders,  the Company granted, under the 1993 ISP, approximately  2,041,200
restricted stock awards  consisting of 400 shares each to 4,907 RadioShack store
managers and 800 shares each to 98 Computer City store managers.  The restricted
stock  awards had a weighted  average fair market value of $22.59 per share when
granted.  This  restricted  stock vested at the end of five years on February 2,
2002,  if the  Company  employed  the  managers  at a store  manager  or  higher
position,  at that time. However, the grants provided that the restricted shares
could vest early if the  Company's  common stock closed at $33 13/16 or more for
any 20 consecutive trading days after February 1, 1999. At December 31, 1998, it
was probable that the  1,289,600  shares that  remained  outstanding  under this
grant would vest under the early vesting  provisions.  The  resulting  charge to
compensation  expense of $82.6 million,  including  related  payroll taxes,  was
recorded in the December 31, 1998 financial statements.

Tandy  Corporation  1997 Incentive Stock Plan ("1997 ISP"): The 1997 ISP permits
the  grant  of up to 5.5  million  shares  in the  form  of  ISOs,  NSOs,  SARs,
restricted  stock,  performance units or performance  shares.  Grants of options
under the 1997 ISP shall be for terms  specified by the  Committee,  except that
the term shall not exceed 10 years.  Option agreements issued under the 1997 ISP
generally  provide that in the event of a change in control,  all options become
immediately and fully exercisable. The 1997 ISP provides that the maximum number
of shares of Company  common stock that an eligible  employee may receive in any
calendar  year in  respect  to  options  and  performance  awards may not exceed
500,000  shares.  The maximum  dollar amount of cash or the fair market value of
shares in any calendar year in respect of performance  units may not exceed $1.5
million.

As part of the 1997 ISP,  each  non-employee  director of the Company  receives,
unless a grant is made at that time under the 1993 ISP,  Director  Options under
similar terms as described in the 1993 ISP section  above.  New  directors  upon
election or appointment will, unless a grant is made at that time under the 1993
ISP, receive a one-time grant of 10,000 shares.

The exercise  price of shares under an option (other than a Director  Option) is
determined by the Committee,  provided that the exercise price shall not be less
than 100% of the fair market value of a share of the  Company's  common stock on
the date of grant.  As  provided  in the 1993 ISP,  the  exercise  price of each
Director  Option  shall not be less than  100% of the fair  market  value of the
Company's common stock on the day preceding the date of grant.

Under the 1997 ISP,  there  were  1,000  vested  options  which  could have been
exercised  at December 31,  1998;  there were no vested  options at December 31,
1997.  In addition,  there were  3,380,000  and  5,500,000  shares  available on
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, for grants under the 1997 ISP.

On February  1, 1998,  the Company  granted,  under the 1997 ISP,  approximately
324,750  restricted  stock  awards  consisting  of  250  shares  each  to  1,299
RadioShack  store managers not included in the February 1, 1997 grant  described
above.  The restricted  stock awards had a weighted average fair market value of
$39.22 per share when  granted.  This  restricted  stock will vest at the end of
five years on February 2, 2003,  if the Company  employs the managers at a store
manager or higher position,  at that time. However,  the grants provide that the
restricted  shares could vest early if the Company's  common stock closes at $58
1/8 or more  for  any 20  consecutive  trading  days  after  February  1,  2000.
Compensation  expense,  equal to the fair market  value of the  shares,  will be
recognized over the remaining  vesting period when it becomes  probable that the
performance  criteria will be met or upon actual vesting.  At December 31, 1998,
there were 222,000 restricted stock awards outstanding and eligible for ultimate
vesting pursuant to this restricted stock award.

Also during 1998,  the Committee  granted a total of 50,000 shares of restricted
stock awards to three executive  officers;  30,000 shares were granted under the
1997 ISP and 20,000  shares were granted  under the 1993 ISP.  These shares vest
ratably over a three year period.  The Company also granted an additional 36,000
shares of  restricted  stock awards under the 1997 ISP to an executive  officer.
These shares vest on October 23, 2005;  however,  shares in blocks of 12,000 can
vest earlier if the Company's  common stock price exceeds  certain levels for 15
consecutive trading days.

Pro Forma Information:  Pro forma information  regarding net income and earnings
per share as  required  by FAS 123 has been  determined  as if the  Company  had
accounted for its employee stock options and  restricted  stock awards under the
fair value method of that statement. The fair value of each option or restricted
stock award is  estimated  on the date of grant using the  Black-Scholes  option
pricing model. The weighted average  assumptions used for stock option grants in
1998, 1997 and 1996 were,  respectively:  expected dividend yields of 1.6%, 1.7%
and 2.0%;  expected  volatilities of 24.3%,  25.5% and 27.9%; risk free interest
rates of 4.5%, 6.1% and 6.7% and expected lives of six, six and seven years. The
weighted  average  assumptions used for restricted stock grants in 1998 and 1997
were: expected dividend yields of 1.6% and 1.7%;  expected volatilities of 24.8%
and 25.9%;  risk free interest rates of 5.4% and 6.3% and expected lives of five
years.

NOTE 18 - PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
In August 1986,  the Board of Directors  adopted a  stockholder  rights plan and
declared  a dividend  of one right for each  outstanding  share of Tandy  common
stock. The rights, as amended, which will expire on June 22, 2000, are currently
represented by the common stock  certificates  and when they become  exercisable
will entitle holders to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Tandy Series A
Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock for an exercise price of $70 (subject to
adjustment).  The rights will become  exercisable and will trade separately from
the common stock only upon the date of public announcement that a person, entity
or group ("Person") has acquired 15% or more of Tandy's outstanding common stock
without the prior consent or approval of the disinterested directors ("Acquiring
Person") or ten days after the  commencement or public  announcement of a tender
or exchange offer which would result in any person becoming an Acquiring Person.
In the event that any person  becomes an  Acquiring  Person,  the rights will be
exercisable  for 60 days  thereafter  for Tandy common stock with a prior market
value (as determined  under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise  price.
In the event that,  after any person  becomes an Acquiring  Person,  the Company
engages in certain mergers, consolidations,  or sales of assets representing 50%
or more of its assets or  earning  power with an  Acquiring  Person (or  persons
acting on behalf of or in  concert  with an  Acquiring  Person)  or in which all
holders of common stock are not treated  alike,  the rights will be  exercisable
for common stock of the acquiring or surviving company with a prior market value
(as  determined  under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise  price.  The
rights  will  not be  exercisable  by  any  Acquiring  Person.  The  rights  are
redeemable  at a price of  $0.05  per  right  prior to any  person  becoming  an
Acquiring  Person or, under certain  circumstances,  after the expiration of the
60-day period  described above, but the rights may not be redeemed or the rights
plan amended for 180 days following a change in a majority of the members of the
Board (or if certain agreements are entered into during such 180-day period).

NOTE 19 - TERMINATION PROTECTION PLANS
In August 1990 and in May 1995,  the Board of Directors of the Company  approved
termination protection plans and amendments to the termination protection plans,
respectively. These plans provide for defined termination benefits to be paid to
eligible  employees  of the Company  who have been  terminated,  without  cause,
following a change in control of the Company (as  defined).  In addition,  for a
certain  period of time  following  employee  termination,  the Company,  at its
expense,  must continue to provide on behalf of the terminated  employee certain
employment benefits. In general,  during the twelve months following a change in
control, the Company may not terminate or change existing employee benefit plans
in any way which  will  affect  accrued  benefits  or  decrease  the rate of the
Company's contribution to the plans.

NOTE 20 - SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
Cash flows from operating activities included cash payments as follows:

                                Year Ended December 31,
                            --------------------------------              
(In millions)                 1998        1997        1996
- -------------               --------    --------    --------

Interest paid               $   46.9    $   42.8    $   37.8
Income taxes paid               84.2        51.9        60.7

The Company received a subordinated unsecured note for $136.0 million in 1998 as
partial  payment on the sale of CCI to  CompUSA.  In 1998 and 1997,  the Company
received notes  receivable of $3.0 million and $98.3 million,  respectively,  as
partial payment on the sales of Incredible Universe assets. In 1996, the Company
received $30.0 million in AST common stock as partial payment of a $90.0 million
note receivable from AST.

No capital lease obligations were recorded in 1998. Capital lease obligations of
$22.1 million and $4.4 million were recorded during the years ended December 31,
1997 and 1996,  respectively,  for the lease of  equipment  and  certain  retail
stores.

NOTE 21 - CONTINGENCIES
Tandy has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties,  investigations
and pending  actions  involving  allegations  of  negligence,  product  defects,
discrimination,  infringement of intellectual property rights, tax deficiencies,
violations  of permits or  licenses,  and breach of contract  and other  matters
against the  Company  and its  subsidiaries  incident  to the  operation  of its
business.  The  liability,  if  any,  associated  with  these  matters  was  not
determinable at December 31, 1998.  Although  occasional adverse  settlements or
resolutions may occur and negatively  impact earnings in the year of settlement,
it is the opinion of management  that their ultimate  resolution will not have a
materially adverse effect on Tandy's financial position.

NOTE 22 - RELATIONS WITH INTERTAN
InterTAN,  Inc., the former foreign retail  operations of Tandy, was spun off to
Tandy  stockholders as a tax-free  dividend in fiscal 1987. Under the terms of a
merchandise  agreement  reached  with  InterTAN  in October  1993,  as  amended,
InterTAN may purchase,  on payment  terms,  certain  products sold or secured by
Tandy.  A&A  International,  Inc.  ("A&A"),  a subsidiary of Tandy,  is and will
continue to be the exclusive  purchasing agent for products  originating in Asia
for  InterTAN.  A&A  receives  commission  income  for  this  service.   License
agreements,  as amended,  also provide a royalty payable to Tandy. The following
table  summarizes the income  components  generated from operations  relative to
InterTAN for each of the three years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996:

NOTE 23 - SEGMENT REPORTING DISCLOSURES
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131,  "Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". All references to RadioShack

fourth quarter of 1997.  Transactions  between operating segments are not common
and the amounts included are not material to the segment information. The closed
units/restructuring segment includes all Tandy stores and non-retail units which
were part of the store closure plan announced in December 1996 (see Note 5). The
corporate  administration and other segment includes corporate units which serve
all areas of the Company and,  also,  income or expenses which are not allocated
to the RadioShack and Computer City segments.

brought  before the annual  meeting (i) by, or at the direction of, the Board of
Directors or (ii) by any  stockholder of record of the  Corporation who complies

meeting  is given or made,  notice by the  stockholder  to be timely  must be so

SECTION 1.  Number.  The  business  and  property  of the  Corporation  shall be
conducted and managed by a Board of Directors  consisting of not less than three
(3) or more than fourteen (14) members, none of whom need be a stockholder.

The Board of Directors of the  Corporation  shall initially be composed of three
(3) directors,  but the Board may at any time by resolution increase or decrease
the number of directors to not more than  fourteen  (14) or less than three (3).
The vacancies resulting from any such increase in the Board of Directors,  or an
increase  resulting  from an  amendment  of this  Section,  shall be  filled  as
provided in Section 3 of this ARTICLE III.

SECTION 2. Term of Office.  Except as  otherwise  provided by law such  director
shall hold office until the next annual meeting of  stockholders,  and until his
successor  is  duly  elected  and  qualified  or  until  his  earlier  death  or
resignation.

SECTION 3. Vacancies.  If any vacancy shall occur among the directors, or if the
number of directors  shall at any time be  increased,  the  directors in office,
although less than a quorum,  by a majority vote may fill the vacancies or newly
created directorships,  or any such vacancies or newly created directorships may
be filled by the  stockholders at any meeting.  When one or more directors shall
resign from the Board of  Directors,  effective  at a future date, a majority of
the directors then in office,  including those who have so resigned,  shall have
power to fill such  vacancy or  vacancies,  the vote thereon to take effect when

place  within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be fixed
by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board,  or the
CEO as may be  specified  in the  notice or waiver of notice of any  meeting.  A
regular meeting of the Board of Directors may be held without notice immediately
following  the annual  meeting of  stockholders  at the place  where such annual
meeting is held.  Regular  meetings of the Board may also be held without notice
at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of
the Board of Directors.

Special  meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the
Board,  the CEO or the  Secretary  and shall be called by the  Secretary  on the
written request of two members of the Board of Directors.  Notice of any special
meeting  shall be given to each  director at least (a) twelve (12) hours  before
the meeting by  telephone  or by being  personally  delivered  or sent by telex,
telecopy,  telegraph,  or similar means or (b) three (3) days before the meeting
if  delivered  by mail to the  director's  residence or usual place of business.

mail so addressed,  with postage prepaid,  or when transmitted if sent by telex,
telecopy,  telegraph or similar means. Neither the business to be transacted at,
nor the purpose of, any special  meeting of the Board of  Directors  needs to be
specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

Members of the Board of Directors may  participate in a meeting of such Board by
means of  conference  telephone or similar  communication  equipment by means of
which  all  persons  participating  in the  meeting  can hear  each  other,  and
participation in the meeting pursuant hereto shall constitute presence in person
at such meeting.

Any director may waive notice of any meeting by a writing signed by the director
entitled  to the notice and filed with the  minutes or  corporate  records.  The
attendance at or  participation  of the director at a meeting  shall  constitute
waiver of notice of such  meeting,  unless the director at the  beginning of the
meeting  or  promptly  upon his  arrival  objects  to  holding  the  meeting  or
transacting business at the meeting.

SECTION 5. Quorum. A majority, but not less than two (2), of the directors shall

meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted  which might
have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

SECTION 6.  Compensation.  The directors may be paid their expenses,  if any, of
attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, a fixed sum for attendance
at each  meeting of the Board of Directors  and/or a stated fee as director.  No
such payment  shall  preclude any director from serving the  Corporation  in any
other  capacity and receiving  compensation  therefor.  Members of the Executive
Committee  and/or of other  committees  may be  allowed  like  compensation  and
reimbursement of expenses for attending committee meetings.

SECTION 7.  Chairman.  From its  members,  the Board of  Directors  will elect a
chairman to preside  over  meetings of the  shareholders  and of the Board.  The
Chairman may simultaneously serve as any Officer of the Corporation set forth in
Article V. The Board may elect one or more Vice Chairmen.  In the absence of the
Chairman  or a Vice  Chairman,  if any,  the Board  shall  designate a person to
preside  at such  meetings.  The  director's  fee of the  Chairman  and the Vice
Chairman, if any, will be set by the Board.

SECTION 8. Director  Nominations.  Nominations for the election of directors may
be made by the Board of  Directors or a  nominating  committee  appointed by the
Board of  Directors  or by any  stockholder  entitled to vote in the election of
directors  generally.  However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election
of  directors  generally  may  nominate  one or more  persons  for  election  as
directors at a meeting only if written  notice of such  stockholder's  intent to

and of the person or  persons to be  nominated:  (b) a  representation  that the
stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the  Corporation  entitled to vote
at such  meeting  and  intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to
nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all
arrangements or understandings  between the stockholder and each nominee and any
other person or persons  (naming  such person or persons)  pursuant to which the
nomination  or  nominations  are to be made by the  stockholder;  (d) such other
information  regarding  each nominee  proposed by such  stockholder  as would be
required to be included in a proxy  statement  filed pursuant to the proxy rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission as then in effect; and (e) the consent
of each  nominee to serve as a director of the  Corporation  if so elected.  The
presiding officer of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any
person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.

of the  Corporation  shall be evidenced by a  certificate  or  certificates  for
shares of stock in such form as may be  prescribed  from time to time by law and
by the Board of Directors.  The  certificates  of stock of each class and series

Treasurer of the Corporation,  and may be  countersigned  and registered in such
manner as the Board of Directors  may  prescribe,  and shall bear the  corporate

of any such Chairman of the Board, CEO,  President,  Vice President,  Treasurer,

be  facsimiles  engraved or printed.  In case any officer or officers  who shall
have signed,  or whose facsimile  signature or signatures shall have been placed
upon,  such  certificate or certificates  shall have ceased to be such,  whether
because  of  death,  resignation  or  otherwise,   before  such  certificate  or
certificates  shall  have  been  issued  and  delivered,   such  certificate  or
certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered with the same effect as if
such  officer or officers had not ceased to be such at the date of its issue and
delivery.

SECTION 2. Transfer of Shares.  The shares of the stock of the Corporation shall
be transferred  on the books of the  Corporation by the holder thereof in person
or by his attorney  lawfully  constituted,  upon surrender for  cancellation  of
certificates  for the same  number of shares,  with an  assignment  and power of
transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, with such proof or
guaranty of the  authenticity  of the signature as the Corporation or its agents
may reasonably require. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of
record  of any  share or  shares  of stock as the  holder  in fact  thereof  and
accordingly  shall not be bound to recognize  any equitable or other claim to or
interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person  whether or not
it shall have express or other  notice  thereof,  except as otherwise  expressly
provided by law.

SECTION 3. Closing of Transfer  Books and Record  Dates.  The Board of Directors
may in its  discretion  prescribe in advance a period not  exceeding  sixty (60)
days prior to the date of any meeting of the  stockholders  or prior to the last
day on which the consent or dissent of stockholders may be effectively expressed
for any  purpose  without a meeting,  during  which no  transfer of stock on the
books of the  Corporation may be made; or in lieu of prohibiting the transfer of
stock, may fix in advance a time not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date
of any meeting of  stockholders or prior to the last day on which the consent or
dissent of stockholders  may be effectively  expressed for any purpose without a
meeting, as the time as of which stockholders  entitled to notice of and to vote
at such a meeting or whose  consent or dissent is required  or may be  expressed
for any purpose,  as the case may be, shall be  determined;  and all persons who
were  holders  of  record of  voting  stock at such time and no others  shall be
entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their consent or
dissent,  as the case may be,  notwithstanding  any transfer of any stock on the
books of the Corporation after any record date fixed as aforesaid.  The Board of
Directors may also, in its discretion, fix in advance a date not exceeding sixty
(60) days preceding the date fixed for the payment of any dividend or the making
of any distribution,  or for the delivery of evidence of rights, or evidences of
interests arising out of any issuance, change, conversion or exchange of capital
stock, as a record date for the  determination of the  stockholders  entitled to
receive or participate in any such dividend, distribution,  rights or interests,
notwithstanding  any transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after
any record date fixed as  aforesaid,  or, at its option,  in lieu of so fixing a
record date,  may  prescribe in advance a period not  exceeding  sixty (60) days
prior to the date for such  payment,  distribution  or delivery  during which no
transfer of stock on the books of the Corporation may be made.

SECTION 4. Lost or Destroyed Certificates. In case of the loss or destruction of
any  outstanding  certificate of stock, a new certificate may be issued upon the
following conditions:

The owner of said  certificate  shall file with the Secretary of the Corporation
an affidavit  giving the facts in relation to the ownership,  and in relation to
the loss or destruction of said  certificate,  stating its number and the number
of shares  represented  thereby;  such  affidavit to be in such form and contain
such  statements as shall  satisfy the Chairman of the Board and Secretary  that
said  certificate  has  been  accidentally  destroyed  or  lost,  and that a new
certificate  ought to be issued in lieu thereof.  Upon being so  satisfied,  the
Chairman of the Board and  Secretary  shall  require such owner to file with the
Secretary a bond in such penal sum and in such form as they may deem  advisable,
and with a surety or sureties  approved by them,  to indemnify and save harmless
the  Corporation  from  any  claim,  loss,  damage  or  liability  which  may be
occasioned by the issuance of a new certificate in lieu thereof, or if they deem
it appropriate,  to waive the  requirement to secure a bond with a surety.  Upon
such bond being so filed, a new  certificate for the same number of shares shall
be issued to the owner of the certificate so lost or destroyed; and the transfer
agent and registrar of stock,  if any, shall  countersign  and register such new
certificate  upon receipt of a written  order signed by the said Chairman of the
Board and  Secretary,  and  thereupon  the  Corporation  will save harmless said
transfer  agent and registrar in the  premises.  The CEO or the President or any
Vice President may act hereunder in the stead of the Chairman of the Board,  and
an Assistant  Secretary in the stead of the Secretary.  In case of the surrender
of the original certificate, in lieu of which a new certificate has been issued,
or the  surrender  of  such  new  certificate,  for  cancellation,  the  bond of
indemnity  given as a  condition  of the  issue of such new  certificate  may be
surrendered.  A new certificate may be issued without requiring any bond when in
the judgment of the Board of Directors it is proper to do so.

                                   ARTICLE VII

the President,  any Executive Vice  President,  Senior Vice  President,  or Vice
President and by the  Secretary or any  Assistant  Secretary or the Treasurer or
any Assistant Treasurer, or by such other officer or officers,  agent or agents,
as shall be thereunto authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors.

signature  and  issuance  of  proxies  to vote  upon  shares  of  stock of other
companies  standing in the name of the  Corporation.  All such proxies  shall be
signed in the name of the  Corporation  by the  Chairman of the Board,  the CEO,

             b. If Tandy's  average daily closing stock price  outperforms  the
        "Peer Group's"  average  daily  closing  stock  price, you will  receive
        an additional bonus of $.

IV.  Maximum Bonus:

     The bonus paid will be limited to an amount not to exceed $.

V.   This  compensation  plan is not an  employment  contract,  but a method  of
     calculating your total earnings. You forfeit your rights to receive a bonus
     if you  resign  before  the  end of the  current  fiscal  year.  If you are
     terminated  by the  Company,  your rights to receive a bonus will be at the
     sole  discretion  of the Company  and in such  amount as the Company  might
     decide. If you retire at age 55 or over, provided the Company has given its
     consent to your early retirement, or die before the end of the then current
     fiscal year,  your bonus will be  calculated  using  actual  results to the
     nearest end of the month  preceding or  succeeding  such event,  which will
     then be adjusted using the latest budget to include the remaining months of
     the year.  Example:  Retirement date is August 10. Bonus calculations would
     include  actual results thru July 31 and the latest  budgeted  numbers from
     August thru December. The bonus calculated,  which will be an annual bonus,
     will then be prorated  for the partial  year worked i.e.  7/12 times annual
     bonus  calculated  in this  example.  The Stock  Price  percentage  will be
     calculated  using only  actual  results to the nearest end of the month for
     this  year and  last  year.  The  amount  will be paid to you or the  legal
     representative of your estate.

VI.  If at any time  during  your  continued  employment,  your  responsibility,
     duties or title changes, this plan is subject to revision or termination by
     the Company at the time of the foregoing  change. A partial year bonus will
     be calculated using the methodology set forth in paragraph V.

                               SEVERANCE AGREEMENT


THIS SEVERANCE  AGREEMENT  ("Agreement")  is made and entered into as of October
23, 1998 by and between Leonard H. Roberts  ("Executive")  and Tandy Corporation
("Tandy").

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Tandy (the "Board") recognizes Executive's 
valuable experience;

WHEREAS,  the Board has  determined  it is in the best interest of Tandy and its
shareholders to enter into this Agreement with Executive; and

WHEREAS,  for  these  reasons  Executive  and Tandy  desire  to enter  into this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective agreements of the parties 
contained herein, it is agreed as follows:

1.   Term of Agreement and Renewal.  This Agreement shall commence as of October
     23, 1998 and shall  continue in effect until October 23, 2005 (the "Term").
     Tandy, in its sole and absolute  discretion,  shall have the sole right and
     option to extend  the Term of this  Agreement  for such time and under such
     terms and  conditions it may deem necessary or desirable.  

2.   Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement the following terms shall have
     the following meaning:

A.   "Base Amount" shall mean the Executive's  annual salary at the highest rate
     in effect at any time during the 12 month period ending on the  termination
     date of his employment with Tandy,  determined without regard to any salary
     reduction or deferred compensation elections made by the Executive.

B.   "Cause"   shall  mean  if  (i)  the   Executive   intentionally   fails  to
     substantially  perform his  reasonably  assigned  duties  with Tandy,  (ii)
     Executive engages in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious
     to Tandy,  (iii) Executive commits or otherwise is charged with a felony or
     any crime  involving  moral  turpitude,  or any other criminal  activity or
     unethical  conduct which in the good faith opinion of the Board impairs his
     ability to  perform  the duties of his job with  Tandy,  or (iv)  Executive
     fails or refuses to comply with the policies,  standards or  regulations of
     Tandy.

C.   "Disability"  shall mean the  Executive  is  suffering  from a physical  or
     mental condition which, in the opinion of the Board, based upon appropriate
     medical advice and examination,  prevents the Executive from performing the
     duties of his job with Tandy.

D.   "Target  Bonus"  shall  mean  75%  of the  Base  Amount  or the  applicable
     percentage of the Base Amount then in effect.

3.   Compensation  and Benefits Upon  Termination of Employment.  If, during the
     Term,  the  Executive's   employment  with  Tandy  shall  be  involuntarily
     terminated  without  (i)  Cause,  or  other  than by  virtue  of  (ii)  the
     Executive's  Disability or (iii) the Executive's  death, Tandy shall pay to
     the Executive,  in lieu of any further  compensation for periods subsequent
     to the  termination  date,  an amount in cash equal to two times the sum of
     (x) the Executive's Base Amount and (y) the Executive's  Target Bonus (such
     total being hereinafter referred to as the "Cash Severance  Payment").  The
     Cash  Severance  Payment shall be paid in two  installments  with the first
     such  installment  payable on or before  ninety  (90) days from the date of
     termination  and the second and final  installment  payable within eighteen
     (18)  months  from the date of the  first  installment.  In  addition,  all
     outstanding Tandy stock options and restricted stock awards that would have
     otherwise become  exercisable or vested within two years following the date
     of  Executive's   termination  of  employment  with  Tandy,   shall  become
     exercisable  or  vested,  as the case may be,  as if  Executive  was  still
     employed by Tandy during such two year period.  Any options  exercisable by
     Executive  at the time of his  termination  including  any options that may
     become exercisable as a result of this provision in the two years following
     termination  must be exercised by Executive  within  ninety (90) days after
     the  second  anniversary  of such  termination.  Also,  in the event of the
     termination described above,  Executive shall be credited with two years of
     age under any age based benefit plan that may be maintained by Tandy,  with
     any such age based  benefits being payable under the terms of any such plan
     or plans.

4.   Termination  of  Employment  for  Cause,  Death,  Disability  or  Voluntary
     Termination.  In the  event  that  Executive's  employment  with  Tandy  is
     terminated  because of (i) Cause, (ii) Executive's death, (iii) Executive's
     Disability  or (iv)  or the  voluntary  termination  of  employment  by the
     Executive,  then the  Executive  shall not receive any payments or benefits
     under this Agreement.

5.   Payment of Benefits.

A.   If Base Amount and Target  Bonus are payable  under the terms  hereof,  the
     same  shall be  payable in two equal  installments.  The first  installment
     shall be  payable  90 days  after the date of  termination  of  Executive's
     employment  with Tandy and the  second  installment  shall be  payable  one
     calendar year after the date of the first installment payment.

B.   In the event Executive's employment is terminated with Tandy, and Executive
     is due  payments and  benefits  from Tandy under that  certain  Termination
     Protection  Agreement for Corporate  Executives  dated May 18, 1995 between
     Executive  and Tandy (the  "Termination  Protection  Agreement"),  and such
     payments and benefits  are greater than those  provided in this  Agreement,
     then  Executive  shall  only  receive   benefits  and  payments  under  the
     Termination  Protection  Agreement  and no benefits and  payments  shall be
     provided or paid under this  Agreement.  However,  should the  benefits and
     payments due Executive under this Agreement be greater than those under the
     Termination Protection Agreement,  then benefits and payments shall only be
     paid under this  Agreement  and no benefits and  payments  shall be paid or
     provided to Executive under the Termination Protection Agreement.

6.   Non-Competition Clause.  Executive hereby agrees that for a period of three
     years after the  termination of his employment  with Tandy,  Executive will
     not, directly or indirectly,  own, have a proprietary  interest (except for
     less  than  5%  of  any   listed   company   or   company   traded  in  the
     over-the-counter  market) of any kind in, be employed  by, be a partner in,
     or  serve as a  consultant  to or in any  other  capacity  with  any  firm,
     partnership,  corporation,  business  enterprise  or  individual,  which is
     engaged in  competition  with any  business  conducted,  or to  Executive's
     knowledge  contemplated,  by Tandy in any of the geographic  areas in which
     Tandy is operating or proposes to operate.

7.   Remedy for Breach.  In the event of any claimed  breach of this  Agreement,
     the party  alleged to have  committed  such  breach  shall be  entitled  to
     written  notice of such alleged breach and a period of fifteen (15) days to
     remedy such breach.  Executive understands that a breach of any one or more
     of the covenants contained herein will result in irreparable and continuing
     damage to Tandy for which there will be no adequate  remedy at law,  and in
     the event of any breach or  threatened  breach of  Executive's  obligations
     hereunder,  Tandy  may,  in  addition  to the other  remedies  which may be
     available to it:

A.   declare forfeited any sums representing Base Amount,  Target Bonus or other
     fringe  benefits  (including  any  unexercised  stock  options or  unvested
     restricted stock) otherwise due and payable to Executive hereunder, and, or
     alternatively,

B.   file suit to enjoin Executive from the breach or threatened  breach of such
     covenants.

8.   Successors;  Binding Agreement.  The terms and provisions of this Agreement
     shall  be  binding  upon,  shall  inure to the  benefit  of,  and  shall be
     enforceable by Tandy and its  Successors  and Assigns.  Tandy shall require
     any  successors  or Assigns to  expressly  assume and agree to perform this
     Agreement  in the same  manner and to the same  extent  that Tandy would be
     required to perform it if no such succession or assignment had taken place.
     This  Agreement  shall  be  binding  upon  the  Executive  and  his  heirs,
     executors, administrators and legal representatives provided, however, that
     the Executive may not assign his obligations  hereunder,  except by will or
     the laws of descent or distribution.

9.   Notice.  For the  purposes  hereof,  notices  and all other  communications
     provided  for herein  shall be in writing  and shall be deemed to have been

     certified  mail,  return  receipt  requested,  postage  prepaid  or prepaid
     overnight  express  delivery  service,  addressed to Tandy at its principal
     place of business  and to  Executive at his address as shown on the records
     of Tandy,  provided  that all  notices to Tandy  shall be  directed  to the
     attention of the General  Counsel of Tandy or to such other  officer as may
     be  designated in writing in  accordance  herewith,  except that notices of
     change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.

10.  Miscellaneous.  No provisions  herein may be amended,  modified,  waived or
     discharged  unless such  amendment,  waiver,  modification  or discharge is
     agreed  to in  writing  signed  by  Executive  and such  officer  as may be
     specifically  designated by the Board.  No waiver by either party hereto at
     any time of any breach by the other party  hereto of, or  compliance  with,
     any condition or provision hereof to be performed by such other party shall
     be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the
     same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or  representations,
     oral or otherwise,  express or implied,  with respect to the subject matter
     hereof  have been made by either  party  which are not set forth  expressly
     herein.

11.  Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions hereof shall
     not affect the validity or  enforceability  of any other provision  hereof,
     which shall remain in full force and effect.

12.  Non-Exclusivity Of Rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided,  nothing
     herein  shall  prevent  or  limit  the  Executive's  continuing  or  future
     participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation plan,
     stock plan, salary continuation plan, post retirement death benefit plan or
     other  plans,  practices,  policies or  programs  provided by Tandy and for
     which the  Executive  may have under any stock option or other  agreements,
     plans or  arrangements  with Tandy.  Amounts  which are vested  benefits or
     which the  Executive  is  otherwise  entitled  to  receive  under any plan,
     practice,  policy,  arrangement or program of Tandy at or subsequent to the
     date of termination of employment  shall be payable in accordance with such
     plan,  practice,  policy,  arrangement  or  program.   Notwithstanding  the
     foregoing provisions of this Section 11, this Agreement contains the entire
     agreement of the parties  regarding  the  severance  benefits  provided for
     herein.

13.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more  counterparts,
     each of which shall be deemed to be an original  but all of which  together
     will constitute one and the same instrument.

14.  Governing  Law.  This  Agreement has been executed and delivered in Tarrant
     County, Texas and its validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement
     shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas.

15.  Forum.  Any suit  brought  by either  the  Executive  or Tandy  under  this
     Agreement  shall be brought in the  appropriate  state or federal court for
     Tarrant County, Texas.

16.  Captions and Gender. The use of captions and Section headings herein is for
     purposes of  convenience  only and shall not effect the  interpretation  or
     substance of any provisions  contained  herein.  Similarly,  the use of the
     masculine  gender  with  respect  to  pronouns  herein is for  purposes  of
     convenience and includes either sex who may be a signatory.

IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the  parties  hereto  have  signed  this  Agreement  to be
