                                  PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL
   Tandy Corporation, a Delaware corporation,  was incorporated in 1967 ("Tandy"
or  the  "Company").  The  Company  engages  in  the  retail  sale  of  consumer
electronics  including  personal  computers  primarily in the United States. The
Company's  continuing  principal retail operations include the RadioShack(R) and
Computer City(R) store chains. The Company adopted a plan to exit the Incredible
Universe and McDuff retail  business in December 1996.  See Recent  Developments
below for a discussion of this plan.  See Item 7  "Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis of Results of Operations  and Financial  Condition" for a discussion of
divisional sales data.

        Recent  Developments.  On May 21, 1996,  Tandy announced a restructuring
      program for its  Incredible  Universe  division which included an overhead
      reduction  plan, the closing of two stores and costs  associated  with the
      cancellation of certain real estate sites held for new store development.

        On December  10,  1996,  Tandy  announced  that the  remaining 53 McDuff
      stores,  previously  included in the Specialty Retail Group of RadioShack,
      would be discontinued.

        On  December  30,  1996,  the  Company  announced  its  plan to exit the
      Incredible Universe business. The Company has reached an agreement for the
      sale of six Incredible  Universe stores to Fry's Electronics and contracts
      with certain  affiliates  for the sale of the real estate of those stores.
      The Company plans for the remainder of the stores (11) to be sold or to be
      used for other real estate purposes. In addition, the Company announced on
      December 30, 1996 the adoption of a plan to close 21 Computer City stores.
      
        RadioShack. RadioShack is the Company's largest operating division. At
      December 31, 1996, the RadioShack division operated 4,942 (inclusive of 53
      McDuff stores included in the closure plan) company-owned stores,  located
      throughout the United  States.  These stores average  approximately  2,450
      square  feet in area and are  located in major  malls, strip  centers  and
      individual  store  fronts.  To  provide  RadioShack  products  to  smaller
      communities,   RadioShack   had  on  the  same  date a  network  of  1,927
      dealer/franchise stores. The dealers are generally engaged in other retail
      operations and augment their sales with RadioShack products.  This network
      included 77 international dealers at December 31, 1996.

        The  company-owned  RadioShack  stores  carry  a  broad  assortment  of
      primarily  private label  electronic  parts and  accessories,  audio/video
      equipment,  digital satellite systems, personal computers and cellular and
      conventional telephones, as well as specialized products such as scanners,
      electronic  toys and hard to find  batteries.  Personal  computers,  which
      account  for  approximately  11.0%  of the  RadioShack  division's  sales,
      primarily target  progressive family users seeking computers for home, and
      small  business  use.  RadioShack  also  provides  access  to third  party
      services such as cellular phone,  PCS, direct satellite  programming,  and
      pager service.  RadioShack plans to expand its company-owned store base to
      5,000 locations by the year 2000.  RadioShack is also focusing on becoming
      "America's  Telephone  Store".  See "Net Sales and Operating  Revenues" in
      Item  7  for  a  discussion  of  a  recent  RadioShack  telecommunications
      alliance.

        On December 30, 1994, the Company adopted a business restructuring plan
      to close or convert 233 stores which included VideoConcepts(R) stores,
      McDuff Electronics(R) mall stores and a small number of McDuff Electronics
      and Appliance Supercenters.The stores were closed during the first quarter
      of 1995.  On January 3, 1995,  the Company  announced  that the Tandy Name
      Brand Retail Group would be dissolved and the 73  continuing  stores would
      become part of the  Tandy  Specialty  Retail  Group.  Effective  with  the
      December 1996 announcement of the closure of the remaining  McDuff stores,
      the  Specialty Retail  Group was  discontinued.  See Item 7  "Management's
      Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial  Condition"
      and Note 3 of the "Notes to  Consolidated  Financial Statements"  for more
      information on the plan.
      
        Computer  City. As of December 31, 1996, the Company had 113 (inclusive
      of 21 stores  included in the closure  plan)  Computer  City stores  open,
      including  five in Europe and seven in  Canada.  The  Computer  City chain
      operates  primarily  as a  supercenter  format  featuring  many name brand
      computers,  software and related  products,  including IBM,  Apple,  Sony,
      Lotus,  Microsoft,  Compaq,  AST and  Hewlett-Packard.  The  remaining  81
      Computer  City  SuperCenters  average  about 21,150  square feet and carry
      approximately  4,400  products.  Additionally,  11 Computer  City  Express
      stores  serve the smaller  markets and average  12,300  square  feet.  The
      Company plans to open approximately 5 additional stores in 1997.

        Incredible Universe.  At December 31, 1996, Tandy and its subsidiaries
      operated 17 Incredible Universe  stores.  As noted in Recent  Developments
      above,  operations in this chain, in all material  aspects,  will cease in
      1997.  See Item 7  "Management's Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Results of
      Operations   and  Financial  Condition"  and  Note  3  of  the  "Notes  to
      Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information.

   Supporting  the  retail  operations  is  an  extensive   infrastructure  that
includes:

      A&A International,  Inc. - This wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
      serves the wide-ranging international import/export, sourcing, evaluation,
      logistics  and quality  control  needs of the  Company. A&A also  provides
      services for outside customers, primarily InterTAN Inc. ("InterTAN"). Most
      of  A&A's   activity   for  InterTAN   involves   sourcing  of  goods from
      manufacturers in the Far East. For more discussion on InterTAN see Note 24
      of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".

      Tandy Service Centers - The Company  maintains a large service and support
      network to service the consumer electronics retail industry. These centers
      repair  name brand and  private  label  products  sold  through all of the
      Company's retail distribution channels. These centers are also the primary
      support for The Repair Shop at RadioShack  program.  At December 31, 1996,
      there  were 121  service  centers in the U.S.  and  Canada;  however,  the
      Company  plans to close  fourteen of these centers as part of the December
      1996  Incredible  Universe and Computer City store closure plan. The Tandy
      Service division stocks over one million parts.

      Regional  Distribution  Centers - The 12 distribution  centers operated by
      the Company  ship over one  million  cartons  each month to the  Company's
      retail outlets.  Eleven of the 12 distribution  centers  primarily support
      RadioShack  retail  outlets and one cross  docking  distribution  facility
      supports primarily Computer City and will support Incredible  Universe as 
      needed for the remainder of 1997.

      Tandy  Information  Services  ("TIS") - TIS collects  information from the
      retail stores  nationwide and updates large databases with sales and other
      information.  These databases are sophisticated marketing tools benefiting
      every phase of the Company's  operations.  TIS also  processes  inventory,
      accounting,  payroll,  telecommunications  and other operating information
      for all of the Company's operations. In addition,  specialized information
      is tracked for the Company's distribution and corporate activities.

      Tandy Credit Corporation - In December 1994, the Company sold the Computer
      City and Incredible  Universe  credit card  portfolios to SPS  Transaction
      Services,  Inc.  ("SPS"),  a  majority-owned  subsidiary  of Dean  Witter,
      Discover & Co.  Effective  March 30, 1995,  the Company also completed the
      sale of the  RadioShack  and Tandy Name Brand  private  label  credit card
      accounts and substantially all related accounts receivable to SPS. As part
      of the  completed  sales  transaction,  Tandy  Credit  Corporation  (which
      supported  Company sales through  utilization  of credit  promotions)  was
      merged into Hurley Receivables  Corporation,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of
      SPS,  and no  longer  exists.  See  Item 7  "Management's  Discussion  and
      Analysis of Results of Operations  and Financial  Condition" and Note 6 of
      the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information.

      Tandy  Transportation,  Inc.  - A large  fleet of  tractors  and  trailers
      transports  merchandise  from  manufacturers  or  ports  of  entry  to the
      Company's regional distribution centers and local distribution  facilities
      and also delivers to the Company's retail outlets.

      Consumer  Electronics  Manufacturing  - Although the Company sold most of
      its manufacturing operations in 1993 and 1994, the Company still operates
      nine  manufacturing  facilities  in the United  States  and one  overseas
      manufacturing  operation in China,  which is a joint  venture.  These ten
      manufacturing  facilities  cover a total  of  1,324,000  square  feet and
      employed approximately 2,520 workers and professionals as of December 31,
      1996.  The  Company  manufactures  a variety of  products  for use in its
      consumer electronics retailing operations.  These products include audio,
      video, telephony, antennas, wire and cable products and a wide variety of
      hard  to  find  parts  for  consumer  electronic  products.  Most  of the
      Company's  manufacturing  output is sold  through  the  RadioShack  store
      chain.

SEASONALITY
   As is the case with other  retail  businesses,  the  Company's  net sales and
other revenues are greater during the Christmas season than during other periods
of the year. There is a corresponding  pre-seasonal inventory build-up requiring
working  capital  associated with the  anticipated  increased sales volume.  For
additional  information,  see Note 25 of the  "Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements".

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
   Tandy owns or is licensed to use many  trademarks  related to its business in
the United States and in foreign countries.  Radio Shack,  RadioShack,  Computer
City,  Incredible  Universe,  and Optimus are some of the registered  marks most
widely used by the Company. Tandy believes that the RadioShack and Computer City
names and marks are well-recognized by consumers, and that these names and marks
are associated with high-quality  service providers.  The Company's products are
sold primarily under the RadioShack, and Optimus trademarks which are registered
in the U.S. and many foreign  countries.  The Company  believes that the loss of
the  RadioShack  name or mark would be  material to its  business,  but does not
believe that the loss of any other trademarks would be material.

   Tandy also owns various patents relating to retail and support  functions and
various   products  which  Tandy  has  previously   designed  and  continues  to
manufacture.

SUPPLIERS
   The Company obtains merchandise from a large number of suppliers from various
parts of the world. Alternative sources of supply exist for most merchandise and
raw  materials  purchased  by the  Company.  As the  Company's  product  line is
diverse,  the  Company  would not  expect a lack of  availability  of any single
product or raw  material  to have a material  impact on its  operations.  During
1996, the Company sold IBM computer  products which accounted for  approximately
17.5% of total computer  hardware  product sales within the Company.  Management
does not believe that the loss of this one supplier would have a material impact
on its operations.

BACKLOG ORDERS
   The Company has no material backlog of orders for the products it sells.

COMPETITION
   The consumer  electronics retail business is highly competitive.  The Company
competes in the sale of its products and services with department  stores,  mail
order houses, discount stores, general merchants, home appliance stores and gift
stores which sell comparable products manufactured by others.  Competitors range
in size from  local drug and  hardware  stores to large  chains  and  department
stores.  Computer  store chains and  franchise  groups,  as well as  independent
computer  stores and several  major  retailers,  compete with the Company in the
retail  personal  computer   marketplace.   Consumer  electronics  and  computer
mail-order  companies also compete with the Company.  The products which compete
with those sold by the Company are manufactured by numerous domestic and foreign
manufacturers. Many of these products carry nationally recognized brand names or
private  labels  and are sold in  markets  common  to the  Company.  Some of the
Company's  competitors  have  financial  resources  equal to or greater than the
Company's resources.

   Management  believes that among the many factors important to its competitive
position  are price,  quality,  service and the broad  selection  of  electronic
products and computers  carried at  conveniently  located  retail  outlets.  The
Company's  utilization of trained  personnel and its ability to use national and
local advertising media are important to the Company's ability to compete in the
consumer  electronics  marketplace.  Management of the Company  believes it is a
strong competitor with respect to each of the factors  referenced  above.  Given
the highly  competitive nature of the consumer  electronics retail business,  no
assurance  can be given that the Company will  continue to compete  successfully
with respect to each of the factors referenced above. Also, the Company would be
adversely   affected  if  its  competitors  were  to  offer  their  products  at
significantly  lower prices,  introduce  innovative or technologically  superior
products  not yet  available  to the  Company or if the  Company  were unable to
obtain products in a timely manner for an extended period of time.

   The Company focuses on two types of store formats to address the marketplace.
Each of the Company's retailing formats uses a distinct path to the marketplace,
based on its unique customer appeal, marketing strengths and margin structure.

         RadioShack.   RadioShack  stores  offer  the  shopping  convenience  of
            approximately  6,900  (inclusive of 53 McDuff stores included in the
            closure plan)  company-owned  and dealer stores,  primarily  private
            label  high-quality   products,   unique  selection,   knowledgeable
            personnel   and   excellent   customer   service,    including   its
            "service-oriented"   approach.   RadioShack  has  formed   strategic
            relationships  with key vendors in computers  (IBM),  home  security
            (ADT), direct-to-home satellite (RCA, PrimeStar, DirecTV, and USSB),
            telecommunications (Sprint) and wireless communications (Sprint PCS)
            to augment the strong position that it has  historically  maintained
            in  core  product  categories  such  as  batteries,   communications
            equipment, telephones, antennas and electronic components, and parts
            and accessories.

         Computer City. Computer City stores offer approximately 4,400 different
            name brand items,  competitive prices and excellent customer service
            on  computers,  computer  software and  accessories.  This  division
            operates  92 stores (net of the 21 stores  included in the  December
            1996  closure  plan).  Computer  City  operates two  different  size
            formats,  Computer  City  SuperCenters  (81 units) and Computer City
            Express (11 units).  While the  SuperCenters  average  approximately
            21,150 square feet,  Computer  City Express  stores  average  12,300
            square feet, serve smaller markets and also supplement  SuperCenters
            in larger markets.

   The  Company  has  faced  intense  competition  in its  consumer  electronics
retailing businesses. Competition is driven by technology and product cycles, as
well as the economy. In the consumer electronics retailing business, competitive
factors include price,  product quality,  product features,  consumer  services,
manufacturing and distribution capability and brand reputation.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
   Research and development expenditures are not significant.

EMPLOYEES
   As of December 31, 1996, the Company had approximately 48,400 employees. That
number includes  approximately 8,500 temporary retail employees which were hired
for the Christmas selling season as well as 3,500 employees whose positions will
be eliminated  due to the December  1996 store  closure plan.  Management of the
Company  considers the relationship  between the Company and its employees to be
good. It does not anticipate any work stoppage due to labor difficulties.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
   Information on the Company's  properties is in  "Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Results of  Operations  and Financial  Condition"  and the financial
statements  included in this Form 10-K and is incorporated  herein by reference.
The following items are discussed further on the referenced pages:

                                      Page
      Retail Outlets.........................          15
      Property, Plant and Equipment..........          42
      Leases.................................          44

     The Company leases rather than owns most of its retail facilities. However,
the buildings of six Incredible Universe stores are owned rather than leased. As
discussed  in  Item 7  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Results  of
Operations and Financial Condition" and Note 3 of the "Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements", Tandy has announced plans to exit the Incredible Universe
business.  As a result of these plans, it is anticipated that the six Incredible
Universe  buildings  will be sold  during  1997.  The land and  building  of one
Computer City store is owned by the Company.  The  RadioShack  and Computer City
stores are located primarily in major shopping malls,  stand-alone  buildings or
shopping centers owned by other companies. The Company owns most of the property
on which its  executive  offices  are  located  in Fort  Worth,  Texas,  and all
distribution  centers,  except for three which are leased. The Company owns most
of its manufacturing  facilities and land located  throughout the United States.
Existing  warehouse  and  office  facilities  are  deemed  adequate  to meet the
Company's needs in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
   A consolidated action titled O'Sullivan Industries Holdings,  Inc. Securities
Litigation,  which  involved  the Company and was  commenced  in 1994 before the
United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The Court, on
July 2, 1996,  approved the  settlement of this  litigation  and entered a Final
Judgment thereby  resolving this entire  litigation.  The Company had previously
reserved  for  the  financial  impact  of the  settlement  and,  therefore,  the
settlement has not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations or
financial condition.

   Tandy  has  various   claims,   lawsuits,   disputes   with  third   parties,
investigations and pending actions involving allegations of negligence,  product
defects,  discrimination,  infringement of  intellectual  property  rights,  tax
deficiencies,  violations  of permits or  licenses,  and breach of contract  and
other matters against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the operation
of its business.  The liability,  if any,  associated with these matters was not
determinable  at December  31,  1996.  While  certain of these  matters  involve
substantial  amounts, and although occasional adverse settlements or resolutions
may occur and negatively  impact  earnings in the year of settlement,  it is the
opinion of management that their ultimate  resolution will not have a materially
adverse effect on Tandy's financial position.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
        FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

    Tandy   Corporation   ("Tandy"  or  "Company")   participates  in  a  highly
competitive industry that is characterized by aggressive pricing practices in an
attempt to gain market  share.  In developing  strategies  to achieve  continued
increases  in sales and  operating  profits,  the Company  anticipates  customer
demand in managing its product  transitions,  inventory levels, and distribution
cycles.  Due to  rapid  technological  advances  affecting  consumer  electronic
product  cycles,  the Company's  operating  results could be adversely  affected
should the Company be unable to anticipate  product cycle and/or customer demand
accurately.  The Company's ability to achieve targeted sales and earnings levels
depends upon a number of competitive  and market factors and,  accordingly,  are
subject to risk.

    The  regulatory  and trade  environment  in which the  Company  operates  is
subject  to risk  and  uncertainty.  Unfavorable  tariffs  affecting  electronic
products  imported from Asia as a result of a change in U.S. trade agreements or
trade  imbalances  could  affect the Company.  In  addition,  as a result of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, the deregulated telecommunications market in the
future is expected to present both  opportunities  and increased  competition to
the telecommunication  industry's historical role of providing telecommunication
equipment and service to consumers.  Also see "Net Sales and Operating Revenues"
for a discussion of a recent RadioShack(R) telecommunications alliance.

    In arriving at the charges related to the restructuring plan, management was
required to make certain estimates, including but not limited to estimates about
expected proceeds from inventory sales in closed units, real estate  valuations,
timing of closed store  dispositions,  and an assumption that Fry's Electronics,
Inc.  and  its  affiliates   would  complete  the  purchase  of  six  Incredible
Universe(R) stores pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements. Management made
these estimates based on the best information available at the time and believes
that  these  estimates  were  accurate  at the time  they  were  made.  However,
unexpected  delays in  liquidation  and  closing  of asset  sales,  among  other
factors,  could  result in the charges and reserves  previously  estimated to be
inadequate, and future charges would be required.

    With the exception of historical  information,  the matters discussed herein
contain forward-looking  statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are
indicated  by  words  such as  "anticipates",  "expects",  "believes",  "plans",
"could", and similar words and phrases. These uncertainties include, but are not
limited to, economic conditions  including consumer  installment debt levels and
interest  rate  fluctuations,  shifts in  consumer  electronic  product  cycles,
technological  advances or a lack  thereof,  consumer  demand for  products  and
services,  competitive products and pricing, availability of products, inventory
risks due to shifts in market demand,  the regulatory and trade  environment and
other risks indicated in filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

                          ============    =============     ============

    Consolidated  net  sales and  operating  revenues  increased  7.6% to $6.285
billion  in 1996  from  $5.839  billion  in  1995.  The  increase  is  primarily
attributable to two factors:  (1) the addition of 111 RadioShack  stores (net of
closures) and 14 Computer  City(R)  stores  during 1996 and (2) the  incremental
addition of a full year's  revenue  related to stores  opened  during 1995 whose
total 1995 revenue  reflected a partial  year.  Tandy  announced a store closure
plan in  December  1996 and  accordingly,  1997  consolidated  revenues  are not
expected  to match  levels  obtained  in 1996.  Excluding  the  announced  store
closures,  consolidated  sales for 1996 would have approximated  $4.882 billion.
See Note 3 of "Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements" for additional
information.

    For the year ended December 31, 1996,  the Company showed a 2.3%  comparable
store  sales  decline,  which  was  the  result  of all  divisions  experiencing
comparable sales declines during the year. Although the RadioShack division same
store  sales  declined  less  than 1%,  Incredible  Universe  was down  4.2% and
Computer City was down 4.9%.  These  declines are  indicative of the  heightened
level of  competition  within  the  industry  and lower  consumer  demand  which
negatively  impacted the consumer  electronics  industry as a whole.  This lower
demand was primarily  attributed to higher  consumer debt levels and the lack of
new products with significant technological advances.

   RadioShack  sales for 1996  increased  less than 1% to  $3.237  billion  from
$3.219  billion.  The McDuff store  closures,  which are included in  RadioShack
sales,  totaled  $135.8  million in 1996.  Excluding  McDuff,  RadioShack  sales
increased 2.8%. Consumer electronics, while remaining the single largest product
category of  RadioShack's  sales mix,  declined  slightly to 44.8% of sales from
46.1% in 1995 and 45.4% in 1994  principally  due to declines in audio and video
and personal  electronic  sales including  portable radio and cassette  product,
VCRs, and camcorders.  Parts and accessory sales,  including batteries,  rose to
34.1% of RadioShack  business from 32.9% in 1995. The average 1996 selling price
on desktop computers and notebook  computers rose 32.9% and 18.5%,  respectively
over the 1995 average selling price. Although computer sales have increased as a
percentage of total sales,  system units sold have  declined.  Repair income and
cellular commissions experienced a slight decline in 1996 to 10.1% of sales from
10.4% in 1995,  which was up from 6.6% in 1994.  The 1996  decline  in  cellular
commissions is partially  attributable to the changes in the California  market,
which experienced  increased consumer demand in 1995 due to enactment of certain
laws at that time.  RadioShack plans to expand its  company-owned  store base to
5,000 locations by the year 2000. In addition,  through a new dealership program
entitled  "RadioShack  Select",  the  Company  plans to  award  up to 1,000  new
dealerships over the next five years.

     On  September  10,  1996,  the Company,  through the  RadioShack  division,
entered into a telecommunications  alliance with Sprint Communications  Company,
L.P.,  Sprint United Management  Company  (collectively,  "Sprint"),  and Sprint
Spectrum L.P.  ("Spectrum").  This  alliance will allow  consumers to purchase a
full range of  Sprint-branded  telecommunication  services and products  through
participating  RadioShack retail stores. Under the agreement,  Sprint,  Spectrum
and  RadioShack  will  create and  advertise a  "store-within-a-store"  concept.
Customers will have access,  where available,  to a full service  communications
information  center that will offer Spectrum  personal  communications  services
("PCS"), Sprint long distance, local and wireless phone service, Internet access
and paging,  as well as  Spree(SM)  pre-paid  phone  cards and phone  equipment.
RadioShack   will  also  be  the   exclusive   retailer  of  Sprint(R)   branded
"residential"   telephones.   Sprint-branded  PCS  products  and  services  were
available in 240 stores at the end of 1996.  Sprint  telecommunication  services
are expected to be available in approximately 4,000 stores by late 1997.

   Computer  City sales in 1996  increased  17.0% to $2.064  billion from $1.764
billion in 1995.  Revenues for 1995  increased  49% over 1994 revenues of $1.184
billion.  These increases are the result of the chain's growth from 40 stores as
of January 1, 1994 to a total of 113 stores as of December  31,  1996.  Although
the Company  announced the closing of 21 Computer City stores in December  1996,
revenues in this division are not expected to change significantly,  due in part
to stores  opened in 1996 that  were  only  opened a partial  year,  incremental
revenue from the anticipated  addition of approximately  five new stores as well
as Computer City`s increased focus on a more experienced  target customer group.
The 21 closing  Computer  City stores  generated  revenues of $359.1  million in
1996.  See discussion  under  Provision for Business  Restructuring  for certain
actions  management is taking to improve  sales and  operating  results for this
division.

   Incredible  Universe  sales  increased  22.4% to $908.5  million  from $742.0
million in 1995.  Revenues for 1995 increased 94.4% over 1994 revenues of $381.7
million.  These increases are the result of the chain's growth from three stores
as of January 1, 1994 to a total of 17 stores as of December 31, 1996.  Revenues
for 1997 will be materially  reduced from 1996 levels due to the closure of this
division in 1997. Revenues will be eliminated entirely after 1997 (see Note 3 of
the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").

    For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company's  consolidated  sales and
operating  revenues  increased  18.1% to $5.839  billion from $4.944  billion in
1994.  The  increase in sales is primarily  attributable  to the addition of 160
RadioShack  stores (net of closures),  eight  Incredible  Universe stores and 30
Computer  City stores  during  1995.  Due to the closure of 233 Tandy Name Brand
Retail Group ("Tandy Name Brand") stores during the first quarter of 1995, sales
for that  division  decreased  from $271.5  million in 1994 to $28.1  million in
1995.  This division is now closed and sales of the  remaining  Tandy Name Brand
stores are  included in the  RadioShack  total for each period  presented in the
"Net  Sales  and  Operating  Revenues"  table.  See  Note  3 of  the  "Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information.

GROSS PROFIT
    Gross profit as a percentage  of sales  declined from 35.5% in 1995 to 32.2%
in 1996.  The Company's  gross profit margin for 1996 was adversely  affected by
approximately $91.4 million of lower of cost or market inventory  writedowns and
related costs primarily associated with the restructuring  announced in December
1996. Excluding these charges, the gross profit margin would have been 33.6% for
1996.  The  decrease in gross  profit  margin from 35.5% to 33.6% (as  adjusted)
reflects the  continued  effect of Tandy's  lower gross margin  retail  formats.
During  calendar year 1996,  Computer City and Incredible  Universe  represented
47.3% of net sales and  operating  revenues as compared to 42.9% of the 1995 net
sales and  operating  revenues.  Continuing  Computer  City  stores  would  have
approximated  34.9% of 1996 sales after giving  effect to the 1996 store closure
plan. Accordingly, management anticipates that Tandy's consolidated gross profit
percentage  will  increase  slightly for the year ended  December 31, 1997,  due
primarily  to the  1997  closure  of the  Incredible  Universe  division,  which
historically   operated  at  lower  gross   margins  than   consolidated   Tandy
Corporation.  Furthermore, gross profit margin for calendar year 1996, excluding
stores in the closure plan and the 1996 fourth  quarter  lower of cost or market
inventory impairment,  would have approximated 38.8%. See Provision for Business
Restructuring below.

    During 1996, RadioShack's gross margin was up slightly when compared to 1995
due to the relative  stability of product mix as a percentage  of overall  sales
from 1995 to 1996.  No  significant  change is  expected in  RadioShack's  gross
margin for 1997.  Excluding lower of cost or market  writedowns  associated with
store closures,  Computer City's gross margin decreased  slightly in 1996 due to
competitive  forces which continue to exist in the computer  retail industry and
the lack of introduction in 1996 of new products with significant  technological
advances. Incredible Universe's gross margin percentage decreased 2.2 percentage
points from 1995 due to an increase in the relative  percentage  of lower margin
computer sales and price competition in the consumer electronics industry.

    Gross profit as a percentage  of sales  declined from 39.0% in 1994 to 35.5%
in 1995. This decrease reflected the continued  expansion of Tandy's lower gross
margin retail formats.  During calendar year 1995,  Computer City and Incredible
Universe represented 42.9% of net sales and operating revenues compared to 31.7%
of the 1994  total.  During  1995,  RadioShack's  gross  margin  decreased  when
compared to 1994 due to the rapid growth of cellular phone and digital satellite
system sales. Computer City's gross margin remained relatively flat in 1995 when
compared to 1994.  Competitive  forces continued to be a major factor in keeping
margins flat in 1995.  Incredible Universe's gross margins decreased slightly in
1995 compared to 1994  reflecting  the fact that personal  computers and related
equipment, which inherently have lower margins,  contributed a larger portion to
the overall sales mix in 1995 versus 1994.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
   Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  ("SG&A") as a percentage  of
sales and operating  revenues for the year ended December 31, 1996 declined from
the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994. The  accompanying  table  summarizes
the  breakdown of various  components  of SG&A and their  related  percentage of
sales and  operating  revenues.  The lower SG&A  percentage  reflects  the lower
costs,  relative  to net sales and  operating  revenues,  of  Computer  City and
Incredible  Universe,  which operate at lower relative  costs than  consolidated
Tandy Corporation.  Accordingly,  management  anticipates that Tandy's SG&A as a
percentage of sales and operating  revenues will increase  slightly for the year
ended  December 31, 1997,  as Computer  City and  Incredible  Universe  begin to
decrease in their  combined  proportion of overall Tandy  Corporation  business.
Excluding  those stores in the 1996 store closure plan,  SG&A as a percentage of
sales would have approximated 29.7% versus 28.0% for the year ended December 31,
1996. See Provision for Business Restructuring below.

   Payroll and commissions expense increased slightly in 1996 as a percentage of
net sales and operating revenues to 12.1% from 12.0% in 1995, down from 12.7% in
1994.  The 1996 and 1995  decrease as a percentage  of sales from 1994 is due to
the  increase in  combined  Computer  City and  Incredible  Universe  sales as a
percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues from 31.7% in 1994 to 42.9% in
1995 and to 47.3% in 1996.  These  divisions  have an  inherently  lower  salary
structure  when  compared to the total  company.  As of December 31,  1996,  the
Company had  approximately  48,400  employees.  The  preceding  number  includes
approximately  8,500 temporary retail employees who were hired for the Christmas
selling season. See Provision for Business  Restructuring  below for anticipated
work force reductions related to the Company's restructuring programs.

   Advertising  costs for 1996 have  decreased as a  percentage  of sales due to
nonrecurring  1995  promotional  expenses  relating  to the grand  opening of 30
Computer  City  stores  and  eight  Incredible   Universe  stores  during  1995.
Additionally,  RadioShack's  1996  advertising  expense as a percentage of sales
remained consistent with 1995.

   Rent expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 3.8% in 1996 from
3.7% in 1995,  down  from  4.3% in 1994.  The  decrease  from  1994 to 1996 as a
percentage  of sales  directly  relates  to the  closing of 233 Tandy Name Brand
stores in the first  quarter of 1995 and the  increase in the number of Computer
City and  Incredible  Universe  stores,  which  have  lower  rent  expense  as a
percentage of sales than the Company as a whole.

     The  expenses of the credit  operations  have  significantly  declined as a
result  of the sale of the  private  label  credit  card  portfolios  which  was
completed by March 31, 1995.  The sale of the credit card  portfolio  balance in
1994 has significantly reduced the bad debt provision during 1995 as compared to
prior years.  In addition,  servicing  costs  associated with the portfolio have
also been eliminated with the sale. These factors were the primary  contributors
to the  decrease  in the  expenses of the credit  operations  from 1994 to 1995.
Offsetting these reductions is decreased  interest income (see discussion below)
resulting from the credit card portfolio  sale.  Commencing in 1995, the Company
receives  fees from an  unrelated  third party  financier  of its private  label
credit card  portfolio  balance for the  generation  of normal  interest-bearing
accounts,  and pays a fee for the  generation  of  special  purpose  promotional
accounts,  such as "zero interest for twelve  months." These fees are classified
as credit card fees in the  accompanying  SG&A table and are the primary  reason
for the increase in this category in 1995 versus 1994.  Credit card fees expense
also includes fees associated with third party bank credit cards.

Other SG&A  expenses,  which  include  repair,  maintenance,  travel,  and other
miscellaneous  expenses,  have in total remained  relatively  consistent between
3.1% - 3.0% of sales during 1996, 1995, and 1994.

   Net interest expense was $23.4 million for 1996 versus net interest income of
$8.6 million and $48.6 million for 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The reversal to
a net interest expense position in 1996 is primarily attributable to the sale of
the Company's private label credit card portfolios in the fourth quarter of 1994
and the first quarter of 1995.

   Interest  income from the credit card  operations  decreased in 1995 and 1996
due to the sale of the Company's credit card portfolios. As a result of the sale
of the Computer City and Incredible  Universe credit card portfolios in 1994 and
the  RadioShack  and McDuff credit card  portfolios in 1995, the Company will no
longer earn  interest  income from these  portfolios.  Interest  income for 1995
includes the amount of interest received prior to the sale of the RadioShack and
McDuff portfolios.  Interest income relating to the InterTAN,  Inc. ("InterTAN")
notes will  continue in 1997 but at a reduced  level as  principal  payments are
received.  In addition,  the AST Research,  Inc. ("AST") note was repaid in 1996
and,  accordingly,  the Company will no longer receive interest income from this
source.  Other  interest  income  relates  primarily to cash  equivalents of the
Company  and was  higher  in 1994  than in 1995 and 1996 due to  increased  cash
equivalents  resulting  from  proceeds  received  from the 1993  divestiture  of
discontinued  manufacturing  and marketing  operations.  The Company has entered
into contracts  with Fry's  Electronics,  Inc. of Palo Alto,  California for the
sale of the assets of six Incredible  Universe stores and contracts with certain
affiliates  for the sale of the real  estate of those  stores.  Upon  successful
completion of the  anticipated  closings,  the Company will hold multiple  notes
receivable  approximating  $100 million with varying maturities ranging from one
to five years and varying  interest  rates ranging from 5.91% to 6.7%.  Interest
income of  approximately  $3.3 million relating to these notes is anticipated to
be recognized in 1997,  contingent upon the transactions  closing.  Based on the
above, interest income is expected to decline slightly in 1997.

   Interest expense has grown since 1994 as a result of the Company's  increased
usage of short-term  borrowing  facilities  including seasonal bank credit lines
and commercial paper facilities, as excess funds from the 1993 manufacturing and
marketing  operations  divestiture and 1994/1995 sale of credit  operations have
been fully utilized. The use of these facilities was significantly higher during
the years ended  December 31, 1996, and 1995, as the Company  retired  long-term
debt,  funded store  expansion  and  executed a share  repurchase  program.  Net
interest  expense is expected to  increase in 1997 as the Company  continues  to
fund a portion  of its  share  repurchase  program  through  existing  borrowing
facilities.

PROVISION FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING
   Tandy has  initiated  certain  restructuring  programs  affecting  its retail
operations.  These  restructuring  programs  were  undertaken as a result of the
highly  competitive   environment  in  the  electronics   industry.   Management
anticipates these changes will strengthen its business by reducing costs.

   1994  Restructuring:  In  December  1994,  the  Company  adopted  a  business
restructuring  plan to close or convert 233 of the 306 Tandy Name Brand  stores.
At March 31, 1995,  all 233 stores had been closed or  converted.  The remaining
stores became part of the Tandy Specialty Retail Group of RadioShack.  A pre-tax
charge of $89.1  million was taken in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 1994 related
to  the  closing  and  conversion  of  these  stores.   The  components  of  the
restructuring  charge and an analysis of the amounts charged against the reserve
are  outlined  in a table  in Note 3 of the  "Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements".

   1996  Restructurings:  The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $25.5 million
during  the  second   quarter  of  1996  related  to  an   Incredible   Universe
restructuring program announced on May 21, 1996. The charge related primarily to
future lease obligations,  disposition of fixed assets, and certain  termination
costs associated with employees.  The components of the restructuring charge and
an analysis of the amounts  charged  against the reserve are outlined in a table
in Note 3 of the "Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements".  This  program
included  an  overhead  reduction  plan,  the  closing  of two  stores and costs
associated with the cancellation of certain real estate sites held for new store
development.  A  streamlining  of the  division's  overhead  costs  included the
elimination of approximately 20 nonselling  positions per store,  reorganization
of  some  central  unit  functions,  and a  significant  change  in  advertising
strategy. The two stores located in Potomac Mills, Virginia and Charlotte, North
Carolina  were  closed in the  second  quarter of 1996 due to  inadequate  sales
volumes.

   The Company also recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136.6 million in
the fourth quarter of 1996 related to additional  restructuring programs.  These
programs  include the closure of the  remaining  53 McDuff  stores,  exiting the
Incredible  Universe  business  (consisting  of 17  stores),  and  closure of 21
Computer  City  stores.  Computer  City will strive to  reposition  its focus on
target customers who are the experienced  users, small office/home office group,
and corporate  accounts.  Along with the target  customer group focus,  Computer
City will work toward a more productive,  higher margin mix of business in areas
such as services, software and peripherals. The Company will continue to closely
monitor the operating  results of this  division.  Management  believes that its
current restructuring strategy will improve this division's operations; however,
there can be no assurance that it will be successful.

   The fourth  quarter 1996  restructuring  charges  related  primarily to lease
obligations,  real estate costs,  employee  termination  expenses,  and contract
cancellation  costs. The components of the restructuring  charge and an analysis
of the reserve are  outlined in a table in Note 3 of the "Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements".  Implementation of the restructuring programs will result
in the elimination of approximately 3,500 employee positions. Management expects
the  restructuring  plan and cash  expenditures  relating to the  programs to be
completed by December 31, 1997 in all material  respects.  Cash expenditures are
anticipated  to be  funded  through  cash  flow  from  operations  and  existing
borrowing  facilities.  The  cumulative  1996  restructuring  and store  closure
programs  resulted  in  significant  impairments  related to  long-lived  assets
totaling  $112.8  million  (see  discussion  below)  and lower of cost or market
impairments  totaling $91.4 million  recognized  within cost of sales (see Gross
Profit discussion above).

IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
   In March 1995, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (the "FASB") issued
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  121,  "Accounting  for the
Impairment of  Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of"
("FAS 121"),  which was effective for fiscal years  beginning after December 15,
1995. Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted FAS 121 which requires that
long-lived  assets (primarily  property,  plant and equipment and goodwill) held
and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment  whenever  events or changes in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  net  book  value  of the  asset  may  not be
recoverable.  An  impairment  loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected
future cash flows  (undiscounted  and before interest) from the use of the asset
is less than the net book value of the asset.  The amount of the impairment loss
will generally be measured as the  difference  between the net book value of the
assets and the estimated fair value of the related assets.

   Upon adoption of FAS 121 in the first quarter of 1996, the Company recognized
an initial non-cash  impairment loss of  approximately  $26.0 million to conform
with this  statement,  primarily as a result of grouping  assets at their lowest
level of cash flows to determine impairment as required by this statement.  Fair
value was principally  determined  based upon estimated  future  discounted cash
flows  (before  interest)  related  to each group of assets.  The  Company  also
recorded a non-cash  impairment of $8.0 million in the  restructuring  charge in
May 1996.

   The Company  recognized an  additional  non-cash  impairment  charge of $86.8
million  in the fourth  quarter of 1996  primarily  related to the  disposal  of
certain  long-lived assets pursuant to its restructuring plan (see Note 3 of the
"Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements").  These assets principally relate
to the Incredible  Universe,  Computer City and remaining McDuff stores that are
part of the store closure plan and certain  foreign real estate.  Fair value was
principally  determined by quoted market prices.  Management expects the plan of
disposal to be accomplished in all material  respects by approximately  December
31,  1997.  The net book value of the  long-lived  assets to be  disposed  of at
December  31,  1996  approximated  $68.2  million.  See Note 3 of the  "Notes to
Consolidated  Financial Statements" for the 1996 operating results of the stores
included in the store closure plan.

UNREALIZED LOSS ON AST SECURITIES
   On July 12,  1996,  the  Company  received  $60.0  million  in cash and $30.0
million in AST common  stock as final  payment of a $90.0  million  note payable
from AST to the Company. The 4,498,594 shares of AST common stock Tandy received
represented  approximately  7.8% of the  outstanding  common stock of AST at the
time of receipt. The Company's cost basis approximated $6.67 per share.

   On January 30, 1997, Samsung  Electronics Co., Ltd.  ("Samsung")  proposed to
purchase the  remaining  outstanding  shares of AST common stock it does not own
(Samsung owned approximately 46% as of December 31, 1996) for cash consideration
of $5.10 per share.  As a result,  the Company  considers  the decline  from its
original  cost basis of $6.67 per share and  Samsung's  offer price of $5.10 per
share to be "other than  temporary"  and,  accordingly,  has assigned a new cost
basis to the stock of $5.10 per share. The recognition of this reduction in cost
basis was recorded as an unrealized loss of approximately  $7.0 million which is
reflected as an increase to selling,  general and administrative  expense in the
accompanying  1996  Consolidated  Statements  of Income.  Upon  consummation  of
Samsung's  proposal at the offer price of $5.10 per share, the "unrealized loss"
would effectively become "realized".

   Consummation of Samsung's  proposed  acquisition of AST is subject to several
conditions,  including approval of the transaction by the independent directors,
negotiation  and  execution of a mutually  satisfactory  merger  agreement,  and
receipt of all required United States and Korean governmental approvals.

GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS AND EXTENDED SERVICE CONTRACTS
     In  December  1994,  the  Company   entered  into  an  agreement  with  SPS
Transaction Services, Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover
& Company  ("SPS") to sell its Computer  City and  Incredible  Universe  private
label credit card  portfolios  without  recourse.  As a result of the agreement,
Tandy  received cash of $85.8 million and received a deferred  payment of $179.8
million. The Company recognized a gain of $35.7 million in the accompanying 1994
Consolidated  Statements of Income. The total principal amount of $179.8 million
was paid in full during 1995.

   On March 30, 1995, the Company  completed the sale, at net book value, of the
RadioShack  and  Tandy  Name  Brand  private  label  credit  card  accounts  and
substantially all related accounts receivable to Hurley State Bank, a subsidiary
of SPS. As a result of the  transaction,  Tandy received  $342.8 million in cash
and a deferred payment amount of $49.4 million which has been paid in full.

   Effective  December  1994,  the  Company  transferred  all  of  its  existing
obligations with respect to extended service  contracts in force at December 31,
1994, with the exception of certain  contracts  aggregating  approximately  $7.7
million,  to an unrelated third party.  The unrelated third party  contractually
assumed all of the Company's legal  obligations and risk of future loss pursuant
to the extended  service  contracts in exchange for $75.0 million.  As a result,
the Company  recognized a gain of $55.7 million associated with this transaction
in  its  accompanying  1994  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  The  Company
continues to provide repair services to customers who tender  products  pursuant
to the extended service contracts on a non-exclusive  basis. The unrelated third
party pays the Company competitive market rates for repairs on products tendered
pursuant to the extended service contracts.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
   The  effective  tax benefit rate that  resulted  from the  Company's net loss
position  was 37.1% for the year ended  December  31,  1996,  and the  effective
provision rate was 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 1995, and 37.6% for the
year ended  December 31, 1994. The effective tax rate for 1996 changed from 1995
due primarily to foreign  income taxes which were incurred on foreign  income in
1996 despite the overall loss incurred by the Company.

   The IRS Dallas office had previously referred certain issues in the Company's
1987 tax return to the IRS  National  Office.  The issues  involved  the private
letter rulings issued by the IRS in connection with the spin-off of InterTAN and
certain other tax matters.  On June 20, 1996,  the IRS notified the Company that
it would no longer challenge the private letter ruling issued in connection with
the  InterTAN  spin-off.  In December  of 1996,  the IRS Dallas  Appeals  Office
notified  the  Company  that it is no  longer  pursuing  the  remaining  matters
associated with the separation of InterTAN from the Company.

TAX SHARING AND TAX BENEFIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
     On  February  2,  1994,  O'Sullivan  Industries  ("O'Sullivan"),  a  former
subsidiary of Tandy Corporation, completed an initial public offering. Tandy has
recognized income of approximately $0.2 million,  $1.3 million and $4.4 million,
net  of  tax,  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  1996,  1995  and  1994,
respectively,  pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement Agreement
(the  "Agreement")  between Tandy and  O'Sullivan.  Under the  Agreement,  Tandy
receives  payments from  O'Sullivan  approximating  the federal tax benefit that
O'Sullivan  realizes from the increased tax basis of its assets  resulting  from
the initial public  offering.  The higher tax basis increases  O'Sullivan's  tax
deductions and, accordingly,  reduces income taxes payable by O'Sullivan.  These
payments  will be made  over a  15-year  time  period  and are  contingent  upon
O'Sullivan's taxable income each year. The Company is recognizing these payments
as additional  sale  proceeds and gain in the year in which the payments  become
due and payable to the Company pursuant to the Agreement. The additional gain is
recorded  as a  reduction  of  SG&A  expense  in the  accompanying  Consolidated
Statements of Income.

CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY
                                   Year Ended
                                  December 31,
                              ------------------------------------------------

Financing activities               (216.6)            (554.8)           (513.1)

   Tandy's cash flow and liquidity,  in  management's  opinion,  remains strong.
During the year ended December 31, 1996,  cash provided by operations was $307.5
million as compared to $673.0  million for the year ended  December 31, 1995 and
$268.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1994.

   The increased cash flow from operations for 1995 as compared to both 1996 and
1994 was the result of  nonrecurring  cash  flows  generated  in 1995  primarily
related to the cash received from the sale of the credit card portfolios,  which
approximated $342.8 million,  and collection of the deferred payment amount from
SPS of $179.8 million.

   Inventory  for   RadioShack   and  related   support   operations   decreased
approximately $30.0 million in 1996, while during the same period, Computer City
and Incredible Universe inventories (prior to restructuring  reserves) increased
approximately $30.1 million.  These year-to-year  inventory  fluctuations offset
one another,  resulting  in no material net cash effect for the year.  It is not
anticipated  that  additional  stores in 1997 will materially  impact  inventory
levels.  Other working  capital  components  generated $49.2 million of positive
cash flow to operations in 1996. In 1995,  inventory  required less cash than in
1994 due to the  liquidation  of the closing  Tandy Name Brand  stores and a net
reduction in Computer City inventory which was partially  offset by increases in
inventory to support Incredible Universe and RadioShack store expansion. Current
liability  reductions  in 1995  surpassed  comparable  1994  amounts  by  $376.2
million.

   Investing  activities  involved  capital  expenditures  primarily  for retail
expansion,  upgrading  information systems and headquarter  building renovations
totaling $174.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, $226.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 1995, and $180.5 million for the year ended December
31, 1994.  Proceeds  from the sale of property,  plant and equipment in 1995 and
1994  resulted  primarily  from  sale-leaseback  transactions  which  netted the
Company $37.6 million and $52.7 million, respectively, in cash. The cash portion
of payments on the note receivable from AST amounted to $6.7 million in 1995 and
$60.0 million in 1996. Proceeds received from the sale of divested manufacturing
and marketing  operations  totaled $359.0 million during the year ended December
31, 1994. Tandy's 1997 capital expenditures are expected to approximate $125.0 -
$135.0  million  which  consist   primarily  of  future  store   expansions  and
refurbishments,   as  well  as  other  capital   expenditures  such  as  updated
information systems.  These expenditures will be funded primarily from cash flow
from operations.

   Purchases of treasury stock required cash of $232.9 million,  $502.2 million,
and $275.4 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Sales of treasury stock
to the Tandy Stock Plan generated cash of $39.4 million, $44.6 million and $41.6
million in 1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Dividends  paid, net of tax, in
1996, 1995 and 1994 amounted to $52.5 million,  $63.0 million and $74.5 million,
respectively. As a result of the Company calling for the redemption of its $2.14
Depositary  Shares  of  the  Company's  Series  C  Preferred  Equity  Redemption
Convertible  Stock  ("PERCS") in March 1995,  the Company  eliminated its annual
dividend payment to the PERCS shareholders of approximately  $32.0 million.  The
Company plans to fund common and Series B (Tandy Employees Stock Ownership Plan,
"TESOP")  preferred  stock  dividends  with  available  cash and cash  flow from
operations.

    At December 31, 1996, the Company increased  short-term  borrowings by $40.9
million. Short-term debt reductions of $1.8 million and $110.4 million were made
in 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Reductions in short-term  borrowings  for 1994
were funded primarily by proceeds from the sale of divested  operations and cash
provided by operations.  The Company's  primary  source of short-term  debt, for
which  borrowings  and repayments  have been  presented net in the  Consolidated
Statements  of Cash  Flows,  consists  of  short-term  seasonal  bank  debt  and
commercial paper, which have maturities of less than 90 days.

    Repayments of long-term  borrowings  during 1996 primarily  consist of $12.9
million of medium-term notes and $10.4 million of TESOP debt and $3.6 million in
capital lease reductions.

    Following  are the current  credit  ratings for Tandy,  which are  generally
considered investment grade:

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
   The Company's  balance sheet and financial  condition  continue to be strong.
The  Company's  available  borrowing  facilities  as of  December  31,  1996 are
detailed in Note 12 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".

   On March  3,  1997,  the  Company  announced  that  its  Board  of  Directors
authorized  management to purchase an additional 5 million  shares of its common
stock  through  the  Company's  existing  share  repurchase  program  which  was
initially  authorized  in December  1995 and  subsequently  increased in October
1996. The share increase brings the total  authorization to 15 million shares of
which  4,582,200  shares had been  purchased  as of  December  31,  1996.  These
purchases  are in addition to the 12.5 million  share  repurchase  program which
began in  August  1994 and  concluded  in  December  1995 as well as the  shares
required for employee plans which are purchased  throughout the year.  Purchases
will be made  from  time to time in the open  market,  and it is  expected  that
funding of the program  will come from  operating  cash flow and  existing  bank
facilities.

   The revolving  credit backup  facilities to Tandy's  commercial paper program
were renewed  during the second  quarter of 1996.  This agreement is composed of
two facilities -- one for $200.0  million  expiring June 1997 and another $300.0
million  facility  expiring  in  June  2001.  Annual  commitment  fees  for  the
facilities are 0.07% per annum and 0.10% per annum,  respectively,  whether used
or unused.

   Tandy's  medium-term  notes  outstanding  under a 1991 shelf  registration at
December 31, 1996 totaled  $54.5  million  compared to $67.1 million at December
31, 1995.

   The total  debt-to-capitalization  ratio was 22.3% at  December  31, 1996 and
17.1% at both  December  31, 1995 and 1994.  This  debt-to-capitalization  ratio
could  increase as Tandy  continues  to  repurchase  shares  under the  existing
authorization and fund capital expenditures.

   Tandy anticipates receiving a net positive cash effect from the restructuring
activities.   Primary  positive   contributors  to  this  cash  effect  are  the
liquidation  of closed  store  inventory  and other  related  assets and the tax
benefit  created  by  the  restructuring  and  FAS  121  charges.  Primary  cash
expenditures  related to the  charge are  expected  to  aggregate  approximately
$138.0  million and  primarily  relate to lease buyout  payments and real estate
disposal  expenses.  The  Company  expects  to  receive a major  portion of this
positive  cash effect  prior to  December  31, 1997 (see Note 3 of the "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements").

   The  Company  announced  on March 3,  1997 that the  Board of  Directors  had
authorized the filing of a $300.0 million Debt  Registration  Statement with the
Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Funding under the  Registration  Statement
will take the form of senior  unsecured notes and medium-term  notes and will be
used to refinance  existing  short-term  indebtedness and for general  corporate
purposes.  The filing and funding of this debt registration is subject to future
market conditions and unforeseen events.

   Management  believes that the Company's present borrowing capacity is greater
than the established  credit lines and long-term debt in place.  Management also
believes that the Company's cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents
and its available  borrowing  facilities  are more than adequate to fund planned
store expansion,  to meet debt service and dividend requirements and to fund its
share repurchase  program. If filed and funded, the issuance of longer term debt
under the new shelf  registration  should improve the Company's  balance between
short-term and long-term debt.

INFLATION
   Inflation  has not  significantly  impacted  the Company  over the past three
years.  Management  does not expect  inflation to have a  significant  impact on
operations in the  foreseeable  future unless  global  situations  substantially
affect the world economy.

INTERTAN UPDATE
   Summarized in the tables below are the notes and other  receivables  due from
InterTAN  at  December  31,  1996  and  1995 as well  as the  income  components
generated from operations relative to InterTAN for each of the three years ended
December 31, 1996,  1995 and 1994.  The estimated  fair market value of the note
receivable  approximates  $28.4  million  at  December  31,  1996.  The  Company
purchased  the notes at a discount  and InterTAN  has an  obligation  to pay the
gross amount of the notes.

   InterTAN,  the former  foreign  retail  operations of Tandy,  was spun off to
Tandy  stockholders as a tax-free dividend in fiscal 1987. Under the merchandise
purchase terms of the original distribution  agreement,  InterTAN could purchase
on payment terms products sold or secured by Tandy.  A&A, a subsidiary of Tandy,
was the exclusive  purchasing agent for products originating in the Far East for
InterTAN.

   In August 1993, Trans World  Electronics,  Inc. ("Trans World"), a subsidiary
of  Tandy,  reached  an  agreement  with  InterTAN's  banking  syndicate  to buy
approximately  $42.0  million of  InterTAN's  debt at a  negotiated,  discounted
price. The debt purchased from the banks was restructured into a seven-year note
with  interest  of  8.64%  due  semiannually  beginning  February  25,  1994 and
semiannual principal payments beginning February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).
Trans World provided  approximately  $10.0 million in working  capital and trade
credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the working  capital loan (the "Series B" note)
of 8.11% was due semiannually  beginning February 25, 1994 and the note was paid
in full in 1996.  Trans World also has received  warrants with a five-year  term
exercisable for  approximately  1,450,000  shares of InterTAN common stock at an
exercise price of $6.618 per share.  The fair market value of these warrants was
approximately  $1.0 million at December  31,  1996.  As required by an agreement
with Tandy,  InterTAN has  registered  the warrants  under the Securities Act of
1933. At December 31, 1996,  InterTAN's  common stock price was $4.88 per share.
At February 19, 1997, InterTAN's common stock price was $4.25 per share.

  Subject to  certain  conditions  described  below,  all of  Tandy's  debt from
InterTAN is secured by a first priority lien on substantially  all of InterTAN's
assets in Canada  and the U.K.  The  Company  was also  granted  a  mortgage  by
InterTAN on certain real property in Australia in 1996.

   A  merchandise  agreement  was  reached  with  InterTAN in October  1993,  as
subsequently  amended,  which requires a percentage of future purchase orders to
be backed by letters of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license  agreements,  as
amended,  provide a royalty payable to Tandy,  which began in the September 1995
quarter.   InterTAN  had  obligations   for  purchase  orders   outstanding  for
merchandise   ordered  by  A&A  for  InterTAN  but  not  yet  shipped   totaling
approximately $23.2 million at December 31, 1996.

   InterTAN  increased its bank revolving  credit  facility with its new banking
syndicate to Canadian $60.0 million (U.S.  $43.8 million  equivalent at December
31,  1996) in 1994.  At December 31,  1996,  InterTAN had borrowed  $2.6 million
under this facility. In the event of InterTAN's default on the bank credit line,
Tandy  will,  at the  option  of  InterTAN's  new  banking  syndicate,  purchase
InterTAN's  inventory and related  accounts  receivable at 50% of their net book
value,  up to the amount of outstanding  bank loans,  but not to exceed Canadian
$60.0 million.  In that event,  Tandy could foreclose on its first priority lien
on  InterTAN's  assets in Canada and the U.K.  If Tandy  fails to  purchase  the
inventory  and  related  accounts   receivable  of  InterTAN  from  the  banking
syndicate,  the  syndicate,  upon notice to Tandy and  expiration  of time,  can
foreclose  upon  InterTAN's  assets in Canada and the U.K.  ahead of Tandy.  The
inventory  repurchase  agreement between  InterTAN's banking syndicate and Tandy
has been amended and restated to reflect the foregoing.

   A&A will continue as the exclusive  purchasing  agent for InterTAN in the Far
East on a commission basis.

   Through  February  1997,  InterTAN has met all of its payment  obligations to
Tandy.  Reported  income before taxes for the six months ended December 31, 1996
approximated  $10.0  million  compared to $13.2 million for the six months ended
December 31, 1995.  Nothing has come to the attention of management  which would
indicate  that  InterTAN  would  not be able to  continue  to meet  its  payment
obligations pursuant to the debt agreements with Tandy.

   Canadian tax  authorities  are  reviewing  InterTAN's  Canadian  subsidiary's
1987-93  tax  returns.   The  Company  cannot  determine  whether  the  ultimate
resolution of that review will have an effect on InterTAN's  ability to meet its
obligations to Tandy,  but at present,  nothing has come to the attention of the
Company  which would lead it to believe  that the  ultimate  resolution  of this
review would impair InterTAN's ability to meet its obligations to Tandy.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Tandy Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index  on page 28  present  fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  financial
position of Tandy  Corporation and its subsidiaries  (the "Company") at December
31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996 in conformity with
generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These financial  statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management;  our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tandy Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTE 1-DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
   Tandy  Corporation   ("Tandy"  or  the  "Company")  is  engaged  in  consumer
electronics   retailing   including  the  retail  sale  of  personal  computers.
RadioShack  is the largest of Tandy's  retail store  systems with  company-owned
stores and dealer/franchise  outlets.  RadioShack's sales and operating revenues
are primarily related to private label consumer electronics, brand name personal
computers,  wireless  communication  products and  services,  and direct to home
satellite  systems.  Tandy also  operates  the  Computer  City(R)  store  chain.
Computer City sales relate to personal computers, printers, peripheral equipment
and  software.   Incredible  Universe  sales  relate  primarily  to  brand  name
appliances and consumer  electronics  including  personal  computers and related
software.  Additionally,  Tandy  continues  to operate  certain  related  retail
support groups and consumer electronics manufacturing businesses.

   In December  1996,  the  Company  announced  its plan to exit the  Incredible
Universe business as well as certain other stores (See Note 3).

NOTE 2-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The consolidated  financial  statements include
the accounts of Tandy and its wholly owned  subsidiaries.  Investments in 20% to
50% owned  companies are accounted for on the equity method.  The fiscal periods
of certain foreign  operations end one month earlier than the Company's year end
to  facilitate  their  inclusion  in  the  consolidated   financial  statements.
Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

   FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  In accordance with the Financial  Accounting
Standards Board (the "FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52,
"Foreign Currency  Translation," balance sheet accounts of the Company's foreign
operations are translated from foreign  currencies into U.S. dollars at year end
or  historical  rates while income and expenses are  translated  at the weighted
average sales exchange rates for the year.  Translation  gains or losses related
to net  assets  located  outside  the  United  States  are  shown as a  separate
component  of  stockholders'  equity.  Gains and losses  resulting  from foreign
currency  transactions  (transactions  denominated  in a currency other than the
entity's functional  currency) are included in net income. Such foreign currency
transaction gains approximated $1.0 million for each of the years ended December
31,  1996,  1995 and 1994 and have been  included  as a  reduction  to  selling,
general and administrative expense in the accompanying  Consolidated  Statements
of Income.

   EXTENDED SERVICE CONTRACTS:  Tandy's retail operations offer extended service
contracts on products sold. These contracts  generally  provide extended service
coverage for periods of 12 to 48 months.  During 1996 and 1995, the Company sold
extended service  contracts on behalf of an unrelated third party and, to a much
lesser extent, sold its own extended service contracts.  Contracts sold prior to
January 1, 1995 were offered  directly by the Company.  The Company accounts for
sales of its own contracts in accordance with FASB Technical  Bulletin No. 90-1,
"Accounting  for Separately  Priced  Extended  Warranty and Product  Maintenance
Contracts" which requires that revenues from sales of extended service contracts
be recognized ratably over the lives of the contracts. Costs directly related to
sales of such contracts are deferred and charged to expense  proportionately  as
the revenues are recognized.  A loss is recognized on extended service contracts
if the sum of the  expected  costs of  providing  services  under the  contracts
exceeds related  unearned  revenue.  Commission  revenue for the unrelated third
party extended service contracts is recognized at the time of sale.

   As described in Note 6, the Company  transferred all obligations with respect
to contracts in force at December 31, 1994 to an unrelated party, except certain
contracts aggregating approximately $7.7 million.

   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:  Cash on hand in stores, deposits in banks and all
highly liquid  investments with a remaining  maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase are considered cash and cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents
are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

   MARKETABLE  SECURITIES:  The Company has an investment in AST common stock at
December  31,  1996 (See Note 5).  This  investment  is  classified  as an other
current  asset in the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  Pursuant  to
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 115,  "Accounting  for Certain
Investments  in Debt and Equity  Securities"  ("FAS 115"),  this  investment  is
categorized  as "available  for sale".  In accordance  with FAS 115,  securities
classified as "available  for sale" are marked to market based upon market value
fluctuations.  Resulting  adjustments,  net of deferred taxes, are reported as a
component of  stockholders'  equity until realized.  Declines in fair value that
are  considered  to be other than  temporary  are  recognized  in  earnings  and
establish a new cost basis for the security.  Realized gains and losses are also
included in earnings and are determined on the specific identification method.

   ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS:  An allowance for
doubtful accounts is provided when accounts are determined to be uncollectible.

  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to customer receivables are limited
due to the large number of customers  comprising the Company's customer base and
their location in many different geographic areas of the country.

  INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally based
on average cost) or market value and are comprised primarily of finished goods.

  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: For financial reporting purposes,  depreciation
and amortization are primarily calculated using the straight-line  method, which
amortizes the cost of the assets over their estimated  useful lives.  The ranges
of estimated useful lives are:

- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buildings.....................................................10-40 years
Buildings under capital lease..................over the life of the lease
Equipment......................................................2-15 years
Leasehold improvements..........................primarily, the shorter of
                       the life of the improvements or the
              term of the related lease and certain renewal periods
- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   When depreciable assets are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts.  Any gains or losses are included in
selling,  general and administrative  expenses.  Major additions and betterments
are  capitalized.  Maintenance  and repairs which do not  materially  improve or
extend the lives of the respective  assets are charged to operating  expenses as
incurred.  Amortization  of  buildings  under  capital  leases  is  included  in
depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

   IMPAIRMENT  OF ASSETS:  In March 1995,  FASB issued  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No. 121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  of Long-Lived
Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be  Disposed  Of" ("FAS  121").  Effective
January 1, 1996,  the Company  adopted FAS 121 which  requires  that  long-lived
assets (primarily  property,  plant and equipment and goodwill) held and used by
an entity or to be disposed of, be reviewed for  impairment  whenever  events or
changes in  circumstances  indicate that the net book value of the asset may not
be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized if the sum of the expected
future cash flows  (undiscounted  and before interest) from the use of the asset
is less than the net book value of the asset.  The amount of the impairment loss
will generally be measured as the  difference  between the net book value of the
assets and the estimated fair value of the related assets.

   AMORTIZATION  OF EXCESS PURCHASE PRICE OVER NET TANGIBLE ASSETS OF BUSINESSES
ACQUIRED: The excess purchase price is generally amortized over a 40-year period
using  the  straight-line  method  and  the  net  balance  is  classified  as  a
non-current asset.

   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  The fair value of financial instruments
is determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques
as  appropriate.  Unless  otherwise  disclosed,  the fair  values  of  financial
instruments  approximate  their recorded  values due primarily to the short-term
nature of their maturities.

   HEDGING AND DERIVATIVE  ACTIVITY:  The Company enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage its interest rate exposure by effectively  trading floating
interest  rates for fixed interest  rates.  As the Company has used the swaps to
hedge  certain  obligations  with floating  rates,  the  difference  between the
floating and fixed  interest rate amounts,  based on these swap  agreements,  is
recorded  as income or  expense.  Through  December  31,  1996,  the Company had
entered into five swaps with regard to notional  amounts totaling $90.0 million.
The swap agreements all expire during the third quarter of 1999.  Prior to 1995,
the Company was not a party to any interest  rate swaps.  The Board of Directors
has  authorized  management  to enter into  interest  rate swaps up to  notional
amounts not exceeding $250.0 million. At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company
would have had to pay approximately $3.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively,
to terminate the interest rate swaps in place. This amount was obtained from the
counterparties and represents the fair value of the swap agreements. At December
31, 1996,  the Company  recognized a  termination  charge equal to the estimated
amount the  Company  would be  required  to pay to  terminate  the swaps of $3.8
million due to the early  termination of the underlying  lease  obligations (See
Note 3).  Effective  January 1, 1997, the Company has  redesignated the interest
rate swaps as a hedge against its floating  rate debt.  These swaps are not held
for trading  purposes.  At December 31, 1996, the weighted average interest rate
of the floating rate debt  obligations  being hedged was 6.2%,  and the weighted
average  interest  rate  of the  fixed  rate  obligations  imposed  by the  swap
agreements  was 7.7%. The interest rate swap  agreements  have been entered into
with major financial  institutions which are expected to fully perform under the
terms of the swap agreements.

   The Company  has not  historically  utilized  derivatives  to manage  foreign
currency risks and exposure except for an immaterial  amount of foreign exchange
forward  contracts  used to hedge a  portion  of its  foreign  purchases.  As of
December 31, 1996,  the Company had no outstanding  purchase  orders for which a
foreign  exchange  contract  was  used  as  a  hedge.  Moody's  has  assigned  a
counterparty  rating to Tandy  Corporation of Baa2. This rating is an opinion of
the financial  capacity of Tandy to honor its senior obligations under financial
contracts.  Financial contracts entered into by Tandy include the limited use of
foreign  currency  forwards to hedge  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from the
purchase of inventory.

   REVENUES:  Retail sales are recorded on the accrual basis.

   STORE PRE-OPENING  COSTS:  Direct  incremental  expenses  associated with the
openings  of  new  Computer  City  and  Incredible  Universe  stores,  comprised
primarily of payroll and payroll-related  costs, are deferred and amortized over
a  twelve-month  period  from  the date of the  store  opening.  Deferred  store
pre-opening expenses for Computer City and Incredible Universe approximated $0.9
million,  $6.8  million,  and $4.5 million at December 31, 1996,  1995 and 1994,
respectively.

   INCOME  TAXES:  Income taxes are  accounted for using the asset and liability
method pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards,  "Accounting for
Income  Taxes"  ("FAS  109").   Deferred   taxes  are  recognized  for  the  tax
consequences of "temporary  differences" by applying enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years to  differences  between the financial  statement and
carrying  amounts  and the tax bases of  existing  assets and  liabilities.  The
effect on deferred  taxes for a change in tax rates is  recognized  in income in
the period that includes the enactment  date. In addition,  FAS 109 requires the
recognition  of future tax  benefits  to the  extent  that  realization  of such
benefits are more likely than not.

   NET INCOME PER AVERAGE COMMON AND COMMON  EQUIVALENT SHARE: Net income (loss)
per average  common and common  equivalent  share is  computed  by dividing  net
income (loss) less the Series B convertible stock dividends (before tax benefit)
by the weighted average common and common equivalent shares  outstanding  during
the  period  (common  equivalent  shares  were not  included  in 1996 due to the
Company's  loss  position).   During  1995,  the  Preferred  Equity   Redemption
Convertible  Stock  ("PERCS")  mandatorily  converted  into common  stock.  As a
result, they were considered outstanding common stock and the dividends have not
been deducted from net income for purposes of calculating net income per average
common and common  equivalent  share. Per share amounts and the weighted average
number of shares  outstanding  for the years  ended  December  31, 1995 and 1994
reflect the PERCS conversion into approximately 11.8 million common shares.

   Fully diluted earnings  available per common and common  equivalent share are
not  presented  since  dilution  is either  less than 3% or the effect  would be
anti-dilutive.

   ADVERTISING  COSTS:  All  advertising  costs of the Company are  expensed the
first time the advertising takes place.  Advertising expense was $254.6 million,
$257.3  million,  and $224.2 million for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995
and 1994, respectively.

   CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS: The Company capitalizes qualifying costs relating
to developing or obtaining internal-use software. Capitalization of costs begins
after the conceptual formulation stage has been completed. Capitalized costs are
amortized over the estimated  useful life of the software,  which ranges between
three and five years.  Capitalized  costs at December  31, 1996 and 1995 totaled
$23.5 million and $3.5 million, net of accumulated  amortization of $2.4 million
and $1.5 million, respectively. Amounts related to 1994 were not significant.

   PERVASIVENESS  OF  ESTIMATES:  The  preparation  of financial  statements  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities,  and related revenues and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss
contingencies  at the date of the  financial  statements.  Actual  results could
differ from those estimates.

   RECLASSIFICATION:  Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to
conform to current year presentation.

NOTE 3-RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
   Tandy has  initiated  certain  restructuring  programs  affecting  its retail
operations.  These  restructuring  programs  were  undertaken as a result of the
highly  competitive   environment  in  the  electronics   industry.   Management
anticipates these changes will strengthen its business by reducing costs.

   1994  Restructuring:  In  December  1994,  the  Company  adopted  a  business
restructuring  plan to close or convert 233 of the 306 Tandy Name Brand  stores.
At March 31, 1995,  all 233 stores had been closed or  converted.  The remaining
stores became part of the Tandy Specialty Retail Group of RadioShack.  A pre-tax
charge of $89.1  million was taken in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 1994 related
to  the  closing  and  conversion  of  these  stores.   The  components  of  the
restructuring  charge and an analysis of the amounts charged against the reserve
are included in the accompanying table below.

   1996  Restructurings:  The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $25.5 million
during  the  second   quarter  of  1996  related  to  an   Incredible   Universe
restructuring program announced on May 21, 1996. The charge related primarily to
future lease obligations,  disposition of fixed assets, and certain  termination
costs associated with employees.  The components of the restructuring charge and
an  analysis  of the amounts  charged  against  the reserve are  included in the
accompanying  table below. This program included an overhead reduction plan, the
closing of two stores and costs associated with the cancellation of certain real
estate sites held for new store  development.  A streamlining  of the division's
overhead costs included the elimination of approximately 20 nonselling positions
per store,  reorganization  of some central unit  functions,  and a  significant
change in  advertising  strategy.  The two  stores  located  in  Potomac  Mills,
Virginia and Charlotte, North Carolina were closed in the second quarter of 1996
due to inadequate sales volumes.

   The Company also recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136.6 million in
the fourth  quarter of 1996  related to the closing of the  remaining  53 McDuff
stores,  exiting the Incredible Universe business (consisting of 17 stores), and
closure of 21 Computer City stores.  Computer City will strive to reposition its
focus on target  customers  who are the  experienced  users,  small  office/home
office  group,  and corporate  accounts.  Along with the target  customer  group
focus,  Computer City will work toward a more  productive,  higher margin mix of
business in areas such as services,  software and peripherals.  The Company will
continue to closely monitor the operating  results of this division.  Management
believes that its current  restructuring  strategy will improve this  division's
operations; however, there can be no assurance that it will be successful.

   The fourth  quarter  charges  related  primarily to lease  obligations,  real
estate costs,  employee termination  expenses,  and contract cancellation costs.
The  components of the  restructuring  charge and an analysis of the reserve are
noted below. Implementation of these two programs will result in the elimination
of  approximately  3,500  employee  positions.  The  Company  has  entered  into
contracts with Fry's  Electronics,  Inc. and certain  affiliates for the sale of
assets and real estate of six Incredible Universe stores. Those contracts are to
be consummated  over a period of  approximately  six months.  The closing of the
first store is expected to be completed  in March 1997.  See  discussion  of the
Fry's Electronics, Inc. transactions below. Management expects the restructuring
plan and cash expenditures relating thereto to be completed and paid by December
31, 1997 in all material respects.

   In association with the 1996  restructurings,  the Company also recognized an
impairment  charge of $112.8 million  pursuant to FAS 121 (See Note 4) and lower
of cost or market impairments aggregating  approximately $91.4 million primarily
related to inventory that will be liquidated at the affected  stores.  Inventory
impairment  charges have been  recognized as an increase in cost of sales in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

   Certain  costs  associated  with  the  operation  of the  stores  during  the
liquidation  period will be incurred in 1997.  As a result,  management  expects
these stores to operate at a loss during the liquidation period, which should be
completed in all material respects by June 30, 1997.

   The transactions with Fry's Electronics, Inc. include the sale of inventories
and non-inventory assets for six Incredible Universe stores and the sale of real
estate to affiliates of Fry's  Electronics,  Inc. Under the  contracts,  the six
closings are  projected  to begin in March and are  projected to be completed by
June 30,  1997.  The  purchase of the real estate of the six stores will include
cash payments of $25.0 million, in aggregate,  and notes totaling $40.0 million.
These  notes  mature  in  four  years  at an  interest  rate of  6.57%,  payable
quarterly.  One year notes  bearing an  interest  rate of 5.91% will be given by
Fry's  Electronics,  Inc.  to  purchase  existing  inventories  at each store at
amounts based upon values at the closing date for each transaction. Principal is
due in equal  quarterly  payments along with accrued  interest.  Five year notes
totaling  $5.0  million  will be given by Fry's  Electronics,  Inc.  to purchase
non-inventory assets. Principal is due in equal annual installments. These notes
bear an interest  rate of 6.70%,  payable  quarterly.  If either  Tandy or Fry's
Electronics,  Inc.  breaches  its  obligations  in  any  material  respect,  the
non-breaching  party will have the option to cancel the  transactions and demand
liquidated  damages of $10.0  million.  The notes are  secured by the  purchased
assets.

   In arriving at the charges related to the restructuring plan,  management was
required to make certain estimates, including but not limited to estimates about
expected proceeds from inventory sales in closed units, real estate  valuations,
timing of closed store  dispositions,  and an assumption that Fry's Electronics,
Inc. and its affiliates  would complete the purchase of six Incredible  Universe
stores  pursuant to the  purchase  and sale  agreements.  Management  made these
estimates based on the best information  available at the time and believes that
these  estimates were accurate at the time they were made.  However,  unexpected
delays in  liquidation  and closing of asset sales  among  other  factors  could
result in the charges and reserves  previously  estimated to be inadequate,  and
future charges would be required.

   Sales and  operating  revenues  and  operating  losses of the  stores  closed
pursuant to the restructuring plans are shown below for each year ended December
31 (unaudited):

NOTE 4 - IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
   Upon adoption of FAS 121 in the first quarter of 1996, the Company recognized
an initial non-cash  impairment loss of  approximately  $26.0 million to conform
with this  statement,  primarily  as a result of grouping  long-lived  assets at
their  lowest level of cash flows to  determine  impairment  as required by this
statement.  Fair value was principally  determined  based upon estimated  future
discounted  cash flows (before  interest)  related to each group of assets.  The
Company also recorded a non-cash impairment of $8.0 million,  which was included
in the restructuring charge in May 1996.

   The Company  recognized an  additional  non-cash  impairment  charge of $86.8
million  in the fourth  quarter of 1996  primarily  related to the  disposal  of
certain long-lived assets pursuant to its restructuring plan (See Note 3). These
assets principally relate to the Incredible  Universe,  Computer City and McDuff
stores that are part of the store closure plan, and certain foreign real estate.
Fair  value was  principally  determined  by quoted  market  prices.  Management
expects the plan of disposal to be  accomplished  by December 31, 1997.  The net
book value of the assets to be  disposed of at  December  31, 1996  approximated
$68.2  million.  See Note 3 for the 1996  operating  results of the stores being
closed.

NOTE 5-UNREALIZED LOSS ON AST SECURITIES
   On July 12,  1996,  the  Company  received  $60.0  million  in cash and $30.0
million in AST common  stock as final  payment of a $90.0  million  note payable
from AST to the Company. The 4,498,594 shares of AST common stock Tandy received
represented  approximately  7.8% of the  outstanding  common stock of AST at the
time of receipt. The Company's original cost basis approximated $6.67 per share.

   During the fourth  quarter of 1996,  the Company  sold  85,000  shares of the
acquired stock for proceeds  aggregating $0.5 million.  Based upon AST's closing
market  price at  December  31,  1996 of $4.1875  per share,  the Company has an
unrealized loss of  approximately  $11.0 million on the remaining  shares of AST
common stock. On January 30, 1997,  Samsung  Electronics  Co., Ltd.  ("Samsung")
proposed to purchase  the  remaining  outstanding  shares of AST common stock it
does not own (Samsung owns  approximately  46% as of December 31, 1996) for cash
consideration of $5.10 per share. As a result, the Company considers the decline
from its  original  cost basis of $6.67 per share and  Samsung's  offer price of
$5.10 per share to be other than temporary and has recognized an unrealized loss
of $7.0 million as an increase to selling, general and administrative expense in
its accompanying 1996 Consolidated  Statements of Income.  The remaining pre-tax
unrealized loss of $4.0 million as of December 31, 1996 has been recognized as a
$2.6 million, net of tax, reduction of stockholders'  equity. As of February 19,
1997,  the Company  holds  4,413,594  shares of AST common  stock and the market
price was $4.625 per share.

   Consummation of Samsung's  proposed  acquisition of AST is subject to several
conditions,  including approval of the transaction by the independent directors,
negotiation  and  execution of a mutually  satisfactory  merger  agreement,  and
receipt of all required United States and Korean governmental  approvals. If the
merger is completed at the offered price of $5.10 per share,  Tandy  Corporation
would ultimately reverse the unrealized loss in stockholders' equity.

NOTE 6-GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT  OPERATIONS  AND  EXTENDED  SERVICE  CONTRACTS  In
   December 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with SPS Transaction
Services,  Inc., a majority-owned  subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Company
("SPS") to sell its Computer City and Incredible  Universe  private label credit
card portfolios without recourse.  As a result of the agreement,  Tandy received
cash of $85.8  million and received a deferred  payment of $179.8  million.  The
Company recognized a gain of $35.7 million in the accompanying 1994 Consolidated
Statements of Income.  The deferred  payment amount did not bear  interest.  The
total  principal  amount of $179.8  million  was paid in full during  1995.  The
Company discounted the deferred payment by $3.5 million to yield interest income
of approximately 5.0% over the twelve month payout period.

   On March 30, 1995, the Company  completed the sale, at net book value, of the
RadioShack  and  Tandy  Name  Brand  private  label  credit  card  accounts  and
substantially all related accounts receivable to Hurley State Bank, a subsidiary
of SPS. As a result of the  transaction,  Tandy received  $342.8 million in cash
and a deferred  payment  amount of $49.4 million.  The deferred  payment did not
bear interest.  The remaining December 1995 discounted  deferred payment balance
of $2.1 million was paid in full during 1996.

   Effective  December  1994,  the  Company  transferred  all  of  its  existing
obligations with respect to extended service  contracts in force at December 31,
1994, with the exception of certain  contracts  aggregating  approximately  $7.7
million,  to an unrelated third party.  The unrelated third party  contractually
assumed all of the Company's legal  obligations and risk of future loss pursuant
to the extended  service  contracts in exchange for $75.0 million.  As a result,
the Company  recognized a gain of $55.7 million associated with this transaction
in  its  accompanying  1994  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.  The  Company
continues to provide repair services to customers who tender  products  pursuant
to the extended service contracts on a non-exclusive  basis. The unrelated third
party pays the Company competitive market rates for repairs on products tendered
pursuant to the extended service contracts.

NOTE 7-CASH EQUIVALENTS
   The weighted  average  interest rates were 5.7% and 4.8% at December 31, 1996
and 1995,  respectively,  for cash equivalents  totaling $25.4 million and $20.8
million, respectively.

NOTE 11-TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
   On March  3,  1997,  the  Company  announced  that  its  Board  of  Directors
authorized  management to purchase an additional 5 million  shares of its common
stock  through  the  Company's  existing  share  repurchase  program  which  was
initially  authorized  in December  1995 and  subsequently  increased in October
1996. The share increase brings the total  authorization to 15 million shares of
which  4,582,200  shares had been  purchased  as of  December  31,  1996.  These
purchases  are in addition to the 12.5 million  share  repurchase  program which
began in  August  1994 and  concluded  in  December  1995 as well as the  shares
required for employee plans which are purchased  throughout the year.  Purchases
will be made from time to time in the open market.

NOTE 12-INDEBTEDNESS AND BORROWING FACILITIES
   Tandy's short-term credit facilities,  including  revolving credit lines, are
summarized in the accompanying  short-term borrowing facilities table below. The
method used to compute averages in the short-term  borrowing facilities table is
based on a daily weighted average computation which takes into consideration the
time period such debt was  outstanding  as well as the amount  outstanding.  The
Company's primary source of short-term debt, for which borrowings and repayments
have been presented net in the Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows,  consists
of short-term  seasonal bank debt and commercial  paper.  The  commercial  paper
matures within 90 days, as does the short-term seasonal bank debt.

   The Company has an active  commercial  paper  program.  Committed  facilities
totaling $500.0 million are in place as backup for the commercial paper program.
This agreement is composed of two facilities: one for $200.0 million expiring in
June 1997 and another facility for $300.0 million expiring in June 2001.  Annual
commitment  fees for the  facilities  are 0.07%  per annum and 0.10% per  annum,
respectively,  whether used or unused. The commercial paper facilities limit the
amount of  commercial  paper  that may be  outstanding  to a  maximum  of $500.0
million.  At December  31, 1996,  there was $59.9  million of  commercial  paper
outstanding backed up by these facilities.

   Medium-term  notes  outstanding  at December 31, 1996 totaled  $54.5  million
compared to $67.1  million at December 31, 1995.  The  weighted  average  coupon
rates of medium-term  notes  outstanding at December 31, 1996 and 1995 were 8.5%
and 8.4%, respectively.

   The Company  established  an  employee  stock  ownership  trust in June 1990.
Further  information  on the  trust  and  its  related  indebtedness,  which  is
guaranteed  by the Company,  is detailed in the  discussion of the Tandy Fund in
Note 17.

   Long-term  borrowings and capital lease  obligations  outstanding at December
31, 1996 mature as follows:

NOTE 13-LEASES AND COMMITMENTS
   Tandy leases rather than owns most of its facilities.  The RadioShack  stores
comprise the largest  portion of Tandy's leased  facilities.  The RadioShack and
Computer City stores are located  primarily in major  shopping  malls,  shopping
centers or freestanding  facilities owned by other  companies.  Store leases are
generally  based on a minimum  rental plus a percentage  of the store's sales in
excess of a stipulated base figure.  Tandy also leases distribution  centers and
office space.

   Future  minimum rent  commitments  (exclusive of stores  included in the 1996
store closure plan) at December 31, 1996 for all long-term  noncancelable leases
(net of  immaterial  amounts  of  sublease  rent  income)  are  included  in the
following table.

   The  effective  tax rate for 1996 changed from 1995 due  primarily to foreign
income  taxes which were  incurred on foreign  income  despite the overall  loss
incurred by the Company.

   The IRS Dallas Office had previously referred certain issues in the Company's
1987 tax return to the IRS  National  Office.  The issues  involved  the private
letter rulings issued by the IRS in connection with the spin-off of InterTAN and
certain other tax matters.  On June 20, 1996,  the IRS notified the Company that
it would no longer challenge the private letter ruling issued in connection with
the  InterTAN  spin-off.  In December  of 1996,  the IRS Dallas  Appeals  Office
notified  the  Company  that it is no  longer  pursuing  the  remaining  matters
associated with the separation of InterTAN from the Company.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1996 and December 31,1995
were comprised of the following:

   The Company  generated a pre-tax book loss of $145.6 million in 1996. Many of
the  restructuring  charges  included  in the  1996  pre-tax  loss  will  not be
deductible  for federal  income tax  purposes  until 1997.  Since the Company is
expected to generate  pre-tax  income in 1997 and future years,  management  has
concluded that the Company should realize the full benefit of its U.S.  deferred
tax assets related to future  deductible  items.  If for some reason the Company
does  not  generate   sufficient   pre-tax   income  in  1997  to  fully  offset
restructuring charges recognized in 1997 for tax purposes,  such amount may also
be realized by carrying back the deductions to offset  taxable income  generated
in 1995 and 1994.  Accordingly,  a valuation  allowance  is not required for the
$164.7 million of deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities.

NOTE 16-TANDY STOCK PLAN
   Eligible U.S.  employees may contribute 1% to 7% (1% to 10% for U.S. eligible
employees,  prior to January 1, 1996) of annual compensation to purchase Company
common stock at fair market  value.  The Company  matches 40%, 60% or 80% of the
employee's contribution depending on the length of the employee's  participation
in the Tandy  Stock  Plan.  Tandy's  contributions  to the Stock Plan were $14.5
million,  $18.0 million and $16.9 million for the years ended December 31, 1996,
1995 and 1994, respectively.

NOTE 17-TANDY FUND
   The Tandy Fund ("Plan") is a defined  contribution plan covering employees of
Tandy  Corporation who have completed one year of service of not less than 1,000
hours per year.  Effective  January 1, 1996, the Tandy Employees Stock Ownership
Plan ("TESOP"), a leveraged employee stock ownership plan was amended and merged
with the Tandy  Employees  Deferred  Salary and  Investment  Plan  ("DIP"),  and
renamed the Tandy Fund.  Other changes made to the Tandy Fund provide that it be
an  individual  account  plan  with  multiple,  participant-directed  investment
options which are intended to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 404(c).

   Prior to  January 1,  1996,  participants'  contributions  were  invested  in
Company  common  stock  only.  Effective  January  1,  1996,  as a result of the
amendment  and  restatement  of the Plan,  participants  were  provided with the
option to direct their contributions in various investment options.

   Prior to  January 1, 1996,  a  participant  was able to defer 5% of his gross
salary  which  was paid into the DIP via  direct  salary  reductions.  Effective
January 1,  1996,  as a result of the  restatement  and  amendment  of the Plan,
participants  are now allowed to defer (in  increments of 1%) a minimum of 1% of
gross salary and wages up to a maximum of 8%.  Contributions per participant are
limited to certain annual maximums as set forth by the Internal Revenue Code.

   For periods prior to January 1, 1996, Company  contributions were made to the
TESOP.  Subsequent  to  January  1,  1996,  Company  contributions  will be made
directly to the Tandy Fund through the TESOP  portion of the Plan.  Participants
become fully vested in Company  contributions  upon the earlier to occur of five
years of service with the Company or three years of participation in the Plan.

   For the Plan year ending March 31, 1997, the Company has designated  that the
total  payments  made to the Plan by the Company  (including  contributions  and
dividends on Series B TESOP  Convertible  Preferred  Stock, the "TESOP Preferred
Stock") will not be less than the amount which (when  combined with the dividend
on the TESOP  Preferred  Stock) is necessary  for the payment of  principal  and
interest on the Plan notes.

   TESOP PORTION OF THE TANDY FUND:  On July 31, 1990,  prior to its merger into
the Tandy Fund,  the trustee of the TESOP now the Tandy Fund  (collectively  the
"Tandy Fund"), borrowed $100.0 million at an interest rate of 9.34% with varying
semiannual principal payments through June 30, 2000. The Tandy Fund trustee used
the proceeds from the issuance of the 1990 notes to purchase  100,000  shares of
TESOP  Preferred  Stock from Tandy at a price of $1,000 per share.  In  December
1994, the Tandy Fund entered into an agreement with an unrelated  third party to
refinance a portion of the Tandy Fund's  indebtedness  by borrowing $5.1 million
at 8.76%.  Pursuant to that  agreement,  in December 1996 and December 1995, the
Tandy Fund  borrowed an  additional  $3.5  million at 7.01% and $4.3  million at
6.47%, respectively.  The 1996, 1995 and 1994 additional indebtedness matures in
December  of  2001,  2001,  and  2000,   respectively.   Dividend  payments  and
contributions  from Tandy will be used to repay the indebtedness.  Each share of
such stock is convertible  into 21.768 shares of Tandy common stock.  The annual
cumulative  dividends  on TESOP  Preferred  Stock is $75.00 per  share,  payable
semi-annually.  Because Tandy has guaranteed  the repayment of these notes,  the
indebtedness  of the Tandy Fund is recognized  as a long-term  obligation in the
accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheets. An offsetting charge has been made in
the stockholders' equity section of the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets
to reflect unearned compensation related to the Tandy Fund.

   Compensation  and  interest  costs  related  to the  Tandy  Fund  before  the
reduction for the  allocation  of dividends  are  presented  below for each year
ended December 31:

          (In millions)             1996          1995         1994

          Interest                     5.1           5.7          6.2

  During  the  term of the  TESOP  notes,  the  TESOP  Preferred  Stock  will be
allocated to the  participants  annually based on the total debt service made on
the indebtedness.

   As shares of the  TESOP  Preferred  Stock  are  allocated  to the Tandy  Fund
participants,  compensation  expense is recorded  and unearned  compensation  is
reduced. Interest expense on the TESOP notes is also recognized as a cost of the
Tandy Fund. The  compensation  component of the Tandy Fund expense is reduced by
the amount of dividends  accrued on the TESOP Preferred Stock with any dividends
in excess of the  compensation  expense  reflected  as a  reduction  of interest
expense.

   Contributions  from Tandy to the Tandy Fund for the years ended  December 31,
1996,  1995 and 1994 totaled $11.4 million,  $11.2  million,  and $11.2 million,
respectively,  including  dividends  paid on the TESOP  Preferred  Stock of $6.3
million, $6.5 million, and $6.7 million.

   At  December  31,  1996,  47,233  shares  of TESOP  Preferred  Stock had been
released and allocated to  participants'  accounts in the Tandy Fund  (including
16,215 shares which had been withdrawn by  participants).  At December 31, 1996,
8,005  shares  of  TESOP   Preferred  Stock  were  released  for  allocation  to
participants on the March 31, 1997 annual allocation date. At December 31, 1996,
44,762  shares of TESOP  Preferred  Stock were  available  for later release and
allocation to participants over the remaining life of the TESOP notes.

   This series of stock has certain liquidation  preferences and may be redeemed
by Tandy after July 1, 1994, at specified premiums.

NOTE 18-STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS
   The Company applies Accounting  Principles Board ("APB"),  Opinion No. 25 and
related  interpretations  in accounting  for its stock option  plans,  which are
described below.  Historically,  the exercise price of options has been equal to
or  greater  than  fair  market  value at the  date of  grant.  Accordingly,  no
compensation cost has been recognized for its stock option plans. No performance
awards have been granted under the plans described below.

   Tandy Corporation 1985 Stock Option Plan ("1985 SOP"): Under the 1985 SOP, as
amended, options to acquire up to 2.0 million fully registered shares of Tandy's
common  stock may be granted to officers  and key  management  employees  of the
Company. The Organization and Compensation  Committee (the "Committee") has sole
discretion in the granting of options.  Generally,  the term of incentive  stock
options may not exceed 10 years, and vest ratably over three years. Nonstatutory
stock  options may not exceed a term of 10 years plus one month and vest ratably
over five  years.  The options  cannot have an exercise  price less than 100% of
fair market value on date of grant.

   In  the  event  of a  change  in  control,  all  outstanding  options  become
immediately  exercisable for the full number of shares subject to options. Since
the option  prices have been fixed at the market price on the date of grant,  no
compensation  has been charged against  earnings by the Company.  Authorized and
unissued shares or treasury stock may be issued to participants when options are
exercised.

   Under the 1985 SOP there were 798,130 and 978,204  vested options which could
have been  exercised  for a total price of $27.7  million,  and $33.6 million at
December 31, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  In accordance  with the 1985 SOP, no
shares shall be granted after November 13, 1995.

   Tandy  Corporation 1993 Incentive Stock Plan ("1993 ISP"): In March 1993, the
Board adopted the 1993 ISP, which was approved by  shareholders in October 1993.
A total of 3 million  shares of the  Company's  common  stock was  reserved  for
issuance under the 1993 ISP. In May 1995, the shareholders approved an amendment
to the 1993 ISP to provide for an initial  option  grant of 5,000 shares to each
non-employee  director, to increase the annual September option grant from 3,000
to 4,000  shares and to provide  for payment of  director  retainer  fees all or
one-half in Company common stock.

   The  1993  ISP  permits  the  grant  of  incentive  stock  options  ("ISOs"),
nonstatutory  stock  options  (options  which  are  not  ISOs)  ("NSOs"),  stock
appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock, performance units or performance
shares.

   Grants of  options  under the 1993 ISP  shall be for terms  specified  by the
Committee,  except  that the term shall not exceed 10 years.  Provisions  of the
1993 ISP generally  provide that in the event of a change in control all options
become  immediately  and fully  exercisable  and all  restrictions on restricted
stock lapse.

   As part of the 1993 ISP, the shareholders  approved an amendment in May 1995,
whereby each  non-employee  director of the Company receives a grant of NSOs for
4,000  shares  of the  Company's  common  stock  on the  first  business  day of
September of each year ("Director  Options").  Director Options have an exercise
price of 100% of the fair  market  value of the  Company's  common  stock on the
trading  day  prior to the date of grant,  vest as to  one-third  of the  shares
annually on the first three anniversary dates of the date of grant and expire 10
years after the date of grant.  The first grant of the Director Options was made
on September 1, 1993.

   The exercise price of an option (other than a Director  Option) is determined
by the  Committee,  provided that the exercise price shall not be less than 100%
of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of
grant.

   Under the 1993 ISP, there were 569,430 and 274,788 vested options which could
have  been  exercised  for a total  exercise  price of $25.1  million  and $10.8
million at December  31, 1996 and 1995.  In  addition,  at December 31, 1996 and
1995 there were 1,387,439 and 1,741,226 shares  available for additional  grants
under the 1993 ISP,  respectively.  The 1993 ISP  shall  terminate  on the tenth
anniversary  of the day  preceding  the date of its adoption by the Board and no
option or award shall be granted under the 1993 ISP thereafter.

   The Company granted,  as of February 1, 1997, under the 1993 ISP an aggregate
of  approximately  1,020,600  restricted  stock  awards  of 200  shares  each to
approximately 4,907 RadioShack store managers and 400 shares each to 98 Computer
City store  managers.  These  shares  vest on  February  1, 2002,  or earlier if
certain events occur.  The benefits are: (1) if managers are employed as a store
manager or higher position by the Company after February 1, 1999 and the Company
common  stock for 20  consecutive  trading  days closes at $67 5/8 or more,  the
stock  will  vest at that  time,  and  otherwise,  (2) the  shares  will vest on
February 1, 2002 if the  managers  are  employed  as store  managers or a higher
position of the Company, at that time. The Company, as of February 1, 1997, also
granted an aggregate of  approximately  185,250 stock options of 750 shares each
to RadioShack district sales managers,  1,500 shares each to RadioShack regional
sales  managers,  and 1,000  shares each to Computer  City sales  managers.  The
exercise  price of the options are equal to the fair market value at the date of
the grant.  Compensation expense,  equal to the number of shares that ultimately
vests at fair market  value at the vesting  date,  will be  recognized  when the
shares  vest.  Accordingly,  earnings  per share will not be affected  until the
shares vest.

   On  January  2,  1996,  the  Committee  awarded a total of  26,500  shares of
restricted stock to the five highly compensated  executive officers named in the
proxy  statement.  These  shares vest  ratably  over three  years.  Compensation
expense will be recognized ratably over the vesting period.

   Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required
by  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  123  "Accounting  for
Stockbased  Compensation" ("FAS 123"), and has been determined as if the Company
had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that
statement. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1996 and 1995,  respectively:  expected  dividend
yield of 2.0% and  1.3%,  expected  volatility  of 27.9%  and  27.3%,  risk free
interest rates of 6.7% and 6.1%, and expected lives of seven years each.

   For  purposes  of pro forma  disclosures,  the  estimated  fair  value of the
options is amortized to expense over the vesting period. The Company's pro forma
information follows:

NOTE 19-PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
   In August 1986, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder  rights plan and
declared  a dividend  of one right for each  outstanding  share of Tandy  common
stock. The rights, as amended, which will expire on June 22, 2000, are currently
represented by the common stock  certificates  and when they become  exercisable
will entitle holders to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Tandy Series A
Junior  Participating  Preferred Stock for an exercise price of $140 (subject to
adjustment).  The rights will become  exercisable and will trade separately from
the common stock only upon the date of public announcement that a person, entity
or group ("Person") has acquired 15% or more of Tandy's outstanding common stock
without the prior consent or approval of the disinterested directors ("Acquiring
Person") or ten days after the  commencement or public  announcement of a tender
or exchange offer which would result in any person becoming an Acquiring Person.
In the event that any person  becomes an  Acquiring  Person,  the rights will be
exercisable  for 60 days  thereafter  for Tandy common stock with a prior market
value (as determined  under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise  price.
In the event that,  after any person  becomes an Acquiring  Person,  the Company
engages in certain mergers, consolidations,  or sales of assets representing 50%
or more of its assets or  earning  power with an  Acquiring  Person (or  persons
acting on behalf of or in  concert  with an  Acquiring  Person)  or in which all
holders of common stock are not treated  alike,  the rights will be  exercisable
for common stock of the acquiring or surviving company with a prior market value
(as  determined  under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise  price.  The
rights  will  not be  exercisable  by  any  Acquiring  Person.  The  rights  are
redeemable  at a price of  $0.05  per  right  prior to any  person  becoming  an
Acquiring  Person or, under certain  circumstances,  after the expiration of the
60-day period  described above, but the rights may not be redeemed or the rights
plan amended for 180 days following a change in a majority of the members of the
Board (or if certain agreements are entered into during such 180-day period).

NOTE 20-TERMINATION PROTECTION PLANS
   In  August  1990 and in May  1995,  the  Board of  Directors  of the  Company
approved  termination  protection  plans and amendments to various other benefit
plans described in Notes 16 and 17. These plans provide for defined  termination
benefits  to be  paid  to  eligible  employees  of the  Company  who  have  been
terminated,  without  cause,  following  a change in control of the  Company (as
defined).  In  addition,  for  a  certain  period  of  time  following  employee
termination,  the Company, at its expense, must continue to provide on behalf of
the terminated  employee certain  employment  benefits.  In general,  during the
twelve  months  following a change in control,  the Company may not terminate or
change  existing  employee  benefit  plans in any way which will effect  accrued
benefits or decrease the rate of the Company's contribution to the plans.

NOTE 21-ISSUANCE OF SERIES C PERCS AND TENDER OFFER
   In February 1992, the Company issued 15.0 million depositary shares of Series
C Conversion  Preferred Stock ("Series C PERCS") at $29.50 per depositary  share
(equivalent to $2,950.00 for each Series C PERCS). Each of the depositary shares
represented  ownership  of  1/100th  of a share of  Series C PERCS.  The  annual
dividend for each depositary  share was $2.14 (based on the annual dividend rate
for each Series C PERCS of $214.00).

   Tandy  announced on January 23, 1995 that it had  exercised its right to call
all the issued and outstanding  Series C PERCS for conversion on March 10, 1995,
prior to its  mandatory  conversion  date of April 15,  1995.  For each Series C
PERCS depositary share redeemed, 0.787757 Tandy common shares were issued for an
aggregate of approximately  11,816,000 shares. In addition,  each Series C PERCS
depositary share received a dividend in cash of $0.321  representing the accrued
dividend from January 16, 1995 through the redemption date of March 10, 1995.

NOTE 22-SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
   The effects of changes in foreign  exchange  rates on cash  balances have not
been material.  Cash flows from operating  activities  included cash payments as
follows:

   Capital  lease  obligations  of $4.4 million and $6.0  million were  recorded
during the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995,  respectively,  for the lease
of certain retail stores. In July 1996, the Company received AST stock valued at
$30.0 million as partial payment of a note receivable (See Note 5).

NOTE 23-LITIGATION
   A consolidated action titled O'Sullivan Industries Holdings,  Inc. Securities
Litigation,  which  involved  the Company and was  commenced  in 1994 before the
United  States  District  Court for the Western  District  of Missouri  has been
settled.  The Court, on July 2, 1996, approved the settlement of this litigation
and entered a Final  Judgment  thereby  resolving  this entire  litigation.  The
Company had previously  reserved for the financial impact of the settlement and,
therefore,  the settlement has not had a material  adverse effect on its results
of operations or financial condition.

   Tandy  has  various   claims,   lawsuits,   disputes   with  third   parties,
investigations and pending actions involving allegations of negligence,  product
defects,  discrimination,  infringement of  intellectual  property  rights,  tax
deficiencies,  violations  of permits or  licenses,  and breach of contract  and
other matters against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the operation
of its business.  The liability,  if any,  associated with these matters was not
determinable  at December  31,  1996.  While  certain of these  matters  involve
substantial  amounts, and although occasional adverse settlements or resolutions
may occur and negatively  impact  earnings in the year of settlement,  it is the
opinion of management that their ultimate  resolution will not have a materially
adverse effect on Tandy's financial position.

NOTE 24-RELATIONS WITH INTERTAN
   Summarized in the tables below are the notes and other  receivables  due from
InterTAN  at  December  31,  1996  and  1995 as well  as the  income  components
generated from operations relative to InterTAN for each of the three years ended
December 31, 1996,  1995 and 1994.  The estimated  fair market value of the note
receivable  approximates  $28.4  million  at  December  31,  1996.  The  Company
purchased  the notes at a discount  and InterTAN  has an  obligation  to pay the
gross amount of the notes.

   InterTAN,  the former  foreign  retail  operations of Tandy,  was spun off to
Tandy  stockholders as a tax-free dividend in fiscal 1987. Under the merchandise
purchase terms of the original distribution  agreement,  InterTAN could purchase
on payment terms products sold or secured by Tandy.  A&A, a subsidiary of Tandy,
was the exclusive  purchasing agent for products originating in the Far East for
InterTAN.

   In August 1993, Trans World  Electronics,  Inc. ("Trans World"), a subsidiary
of  Tandy,  reached  an  agreement  with  InterTAN's  banking  syndicate  to buy
approximately  $42.0  million of  InterTAN's  debt at a  negotiated,  discounted
price. The debt purchased from the banks was restructured into a seven-year note
with  interest  of  8.64%  due  semiannually  beginning  February  25,  1994 and
semiannual principal payments beginning February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).
Trans World provided  approximately  $10.0 million in working  capital and trade
credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the working  capital loan (the "Series B" note)
of 8.11% was due semiannually  beginning February 25, 1994 and the note was paid
in full in 1996.  Trans World also has received  warrants with a five-year  term
exercisable for  approximately  1,450,000  shares of InterTAN common stock at an
exercise price of $6.618 per share.  The fair market value of these warrants was
approximately  $1.0 million at December  31,  1996.  As required by an agreement
with Tandy,  InterTAN has  registered  the warrants  under the Securities Act of
1933. At December 31, 1996,  InterTAN's  common stock price was $4.88 per share.
At February 19, 1997, InterTAN's common stock price was $4.25 per share.

   Subject to  certain  conditions  described  below,  all of Tandy's  debt from
InterTAN is secured by a first priority lien on substantially  all of InterTAN's
assets in Canada  and the U.K.  The  Company  was also  granted  a  mortgage  by
InterTAN on certain real property in Australia in 1996.

   A  merchandise  agreement  was  reached  with  InterTAN in October  1993,  as
subsequently  amended,  which requires a percentage of future purchase orders to
be backed by letters of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license  agreements,  as
amended,  provide a royalty payable to Tandy,  which began in the September 1995
quarter.   InterTAN  had  obligations   for  purchase  orders   outstanding  for
merchandise   ordered  by  A&A  for  InterTAN  but  not  yet  shipped   totaling
approximately $23.2 million at December 31, 1996.

   InterTAN  increased its bank revolving  credit  facility with its new banking
syndicate to Canadian $60.0 million (U.S.  $43.8 million  equivalent at December
31,  1996) in 1994.  At December 31,  1996,  InterTAN had borrowed  $2.6 million
under this facility. In the event of InterTAN's default on the bank credit line,
Tandy  will,  at the  option  of  InterTAN's  new  banking  syndicate,  purchase
InterTAN's  inventory and related  accounts  receivable at 50% of their net book
value,  up to the amount of outstanding  bank loans,  but not to exceed Canadian
$60.0 million.  In that event,  Tandy could foreclose on its first priority lien
on  InterTAN's  assets in Canada and the U.K.  If Tandy  fails to  purchase  the
inventory  and  related  accounts   receivable  of  InterTAN  from  the  banking
syndicate,  the  syndicate,  upon notice to Tandy and  expiration  of time,  can
foreclose  upon  InterTAN's  assets in Canada and the U.K.  ahead of Tandy.  The
inventory  repurchase  agreement between  InterTAN's banking syndicate and Tandy
has been amended and restated to reflect the foregoing.

   A&A will continue as the exclusive  purchasing  agent for InterTAN in the Far
East on a commission basis.

   Through  February  1997,  InterTAN has met all of its payment  obligations to
Tandy.  Reported  income before taxes for the six months ended December 31, 1996
approximated  $10.0  million  compared to $13.2 million for the six months ended
December 31, 1995.  Nothing has come to the attention of management  which would
indicate  that  InterTAN  would  not be able to  continue  to meet  its  payment
obligations pursuant to the debt agreements with Tandy.

   Canadian tax  authorities  are  reviewing  InterTAN's  Canadian  subsidiary's
1987-93  tax  returns.   The  Company  cannot  determine  whether  the  ultimate
resolution of that review will have an effect on InterTAN's  ability to meet its
obligations to Tandy,  but at present,  nothing has come to the attention of the
Company  which would lead it to believe  that the  ultimate  resolution  of this
review would impair InterTAN's ability to meet its obligations to Tandy.

NOTE 25-QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)
   As the Company's operations are predominantly  retail oriented,  its business
is subject to seasonal  fluctuations with the December 31 quarter being the most
significant  in terms of sales and  profits  because  of the  Christmas  selling
season.

   During the quarter ended December 31, 1996, the Company  recognized a FAS 121
charge  and  a  restructuring  charge  of  $86.8  million  and  $136.6  million,
respectively.  In  addition,  gross  profit for the  fourth  quarter of 1996 was
impacted by a lower of cost or market  inventory  impairment  of $91.4  million,
largely  attributable  to  the  restructuring  plan  associated  with  inventory
liquidations for closed stores (see Note 3).

                              PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

        (b) The  Company,  certain of the Banks,  Barclays,  Chase and the Agent
entered into the Agreement  and First  Amendment To Revolving  Credit  Agreement
(Facility  A) (the "First  Amendment")  dated as of May 26, 1995  modifying  the

        (c) The Company,  certain of the Banks, Chase and the Agent entered into
the Second  Amendment to Revolving  Credit  Agreement  (Facility A) (the "Second
Amendment") dated as of May 24, 1996 modifying the Original Credit Agreement, as
amended by the First Amendment.
        (d) The  Company,  the Banks,  Chase and the Agent  entered into a Third
Amendment to Revolving  Credit  Agreement  (Facility A) (the "Third  Amendment")
dated as of June 28, 1996 modifying the Original Credit  Agreement as amended by

THE SAKURA BANK,  LIMITED,  as Banks  thereunder  and  retiring  Chase as a Bank
thereunder.
        (e) The Company has requested that the Banks amend the last paragraph of

assets related to the Company's Incredible Universe business.
        (f) All  capitalized  terms  defined  in the  Credit  Agreement  and not
otherwise  defined  herein shall have the same meanings  herein as in the Credit
Agreement.
        NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises and other good and
valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  are  hereby
acknowledged by the parties hereto, the Company,  the Banks and the Agent hereby
agree as follows:
        SECTION 1. Amendment to Section 6.02 of the Credit  Agreement.  The last
paragraph  of Section  6.02 of the  Credit  Agreement  is hereby  amended in its
entirety to read as follows:
               "For  purposes  of this  Section  6.02  only,  a sale,  transfer,
        conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets shall be deemed to be a
        `substantial  part' of the assets of the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries
        only if the value of such  assets,  when added to the value of all other
        assets sold, transferred,  conveyed,  leased or otherwise disposed of by
        the Company and its  Subsidiaries  (other than  pursuant to clauses (u),
        (v),  (x) and (z) of this  Section  6.02)  during the same fiscal  year,
        exceeds 15% of the Company's  consolidated total assets as of the end of
        the immediately preceding fiscal year; provided, however, there shall be
        excluded from such 15% for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1997, the
        value  of all  assets  related  to  the  Company's  Incredible  Universe
        business.  As used in the  preceding  sentence,  the term `value'  shall
        mean, with respect to any asset disposed of, the greater of such asset's
        book or fair  market  value as of the date of  disposition,  with  `book
        value' being the value of such asset as would appear  immediately  prior
        to such  disposition  on a  balance  sheet of the  owner  of such  asset
        prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles.".
        SECTION 2.  Conditions to  Effectiveness.  This  Amendment  shall become
        effective  when,  and only  when,  the  following  conditions  have been
        fulfilled:
               (a)    the  Company  and the  Required Banks shall have executed
a  counterpart  of this Amendment; and
               (b) the Agent shall have executed a counterpart of this Amendment
and shall have received  counterparts of this Amendment  executed by the Company
and the Required Banks.
        SECTION 3.  Representations  and Warranties True; No Default or Event of
Default.  The Company hereby  represents and warrants to the Agent and the Banks
that after giving effect to the execution and delivery of this Amendment (a) the
representations  and warranties  set forth in the Credit  Agreement are true and
correct  on the date  hereof  as  though  made on and as of such date and (b) no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
        SECTION 4. Reference to the Credit Agreement and Effect on the Notes.
        (a) Upon the  effectiveness  of this  Amendment,  each  reference in the
Credit  Agreement to "this  Agreement,"  "hereunder,"  "herein" or words of like
import  shall mean and be a reference  to the Credit  Agreement,  as amended and
affected hereby.
        (b) Upon the  effectiveness  of this  Amendment,  each  reference in the
Notes to "the  Credit  Agreement"  shall mean and be a  reference  to the Credit
Agreement, as amended and affected hereby.
        (c) The Credit  Agreement and the Notes, as amended and affected hereby,
shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed.
        SECTION 5.  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS  AMENDMENT  SHALL BE GOVERNED  BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND
APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW AND SHALL BE BINDING UPON THE COMPANY,  THE BANKS AND THE
AGENT AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.
        SECTION 6. Descriptive Headings.  The section headings appearing in this
Amendment  have  been  inserted  for  convenience  only  and  shall  be given no
substantive  meaning  or  significance  whatever  in  construing  the  terms and
provisions of this Amendment.
        SECTION  7.  FINAL  AGREEMENT  OF  THE  PARTIES.  THE  CREDIT  AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING THE EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULE THERETO), AS AMENDED HEREBY, THE NOTES, THE
AGENT'S LETTER AND THE OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENTS,  CONSTITUTE A "LOAN  AGREEMENT" AS
DEFINED IN  SECTION  26.02(a)  OF THE TEXAS  BUSINESS  AND  COMMERCE  CODE,  AND
REPRESENT THE FINAL  AGREEMENT  AMONG THE PARTIES  RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF  AND  THEREOF  AND  MAY  NOT  BE   CONTRADICTED  BY  EVIDENCE  OF  PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS  OR  SUBSEQUENT  ORAL  AGREEMENTS  OF THE PARTIES.  THERE ARE NO
UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF
AND THEREOF.
        SECTION 8. Execution in Counterparts.  This Amendment may be executed in
any  number  of  counterparts  and  by  different  parties  hereto  in  separate
counterparts,  each of which when so executed  shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
        IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to be
executed  effective  as of the date first  stated  herein,  by their  respective
officers thereunto duly authorized.

                            THIRD AMENDMENT
                                   TO
                  REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (FACILITY B)


        THIS THIRD AMENDMENT TO REVOLVING  CREDIT  AGREEMENT  (FACILITY B) (this
"Amendment")  dated as of  February  18,  1997 is  among  TANDY  CORPORATION,  a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the banks and other financial institutions

capacity, the "Agent") for the Banks.
                              PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
        (a) The Company,  certain of the Banks,  BARCLAYS BANK PLC ("Barclays"),
THE CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. ("Chase"), and
the Agent entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement  (Facility B) (the "Original
Credit Agreement") dated as of May 27, 1994.
        (b) The  Company,  certain of the Banks,  Barclays,  Chase and the Agent
entered into the Agreement  and First  Amendment To Revolving  Credit  Agreement
(Facility  B) (the "First  Amendment")  dated as of May 26, 1995  modifying  the
Original Credit Agreement by inter alia adding CITICORP USA, INC.  ("Citicorp"),
and COMMERZBANK AKTIENGELLSCHAFT, ATLANTA AGENCY ("Commerzbank"), as Banks under
the Credit Agreement and retiring Barclays as a Bank thereunder.
        (c) The Company,  certain of the Banks, Chase and the Agent entered into
an Agreement and Second  Amendment to Revolving  Credit  Agreement  (Facility B)
(the "Second  Amendment") dated as of May 24, 1996 modifying the Original Credit
Agreement,  as amended by the First Amendment (the Original Credit  Agreement as
amended  by the First  Amendment  and the  Second  Amendment  being the  "Credit
Agreement") by inter alia adding UNION BANK OF SWITZERLAND  and THE SAKURA BANK,
LIMITED, as Banks thereunder and retiring Chase as a Bank thereunder.
        (d) The Company has requested that the Banks amend the last paragraph of
Section 6.02 to exclude from the provisions  thereof the sale and disposition of
assets related to the Company's Incredible Universe business.
        (e) All  capitalized  terms  defined  in the  Credit  Agreement  and not
otherwise  defined  herein shall have the same meanings  herein as in the Credit
Agreement.
        NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises and other good and
valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  are  hereby
acknowledged by the parties hereto, the Company,  the Banks and the Agent hereby
agree as follows:
        SECTION 1. Amendment to Section 6.02 of the Credit  Agreement.  The last
paragraph  of Section  6.02 of the  Credit  Agreement  is hereby  amended in its
entirety to read as follows:
               "For  purposes  of this  Section  6.02  only,  a sale,  transfer,
        conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets shall be deemed to be a
        `substantial  part' of the assets of the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries
        only if the value of such  assets,  when added to the value of all other
        assets sold, transferred,  conveyed,  leased or otherwise disposed of by
        the Company and its  Subsidiaries  (other than  pursuant to clauses (u),
        (v),  (x) and (z) of this  Section  6.02)  during the same fiscal  year,
        exceeds 15% of the Company's  consolidated total assets as of the end of
        the immediately preceding fiscal year; provided, however, there shall be
        excluded from such 15% for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1997, the
        value  of all  assets  related  to  the  Company's  Incredible  Universe
        business.  As used in the  preceding  sentence,  the term `value'  shall
        mean, with respect to any asset disposed of, the greater of such asset's
        book or fair  market  value as of the date of  disposition,  with  `book
        value' being the value of such asset as would appear  immediately  prior
        to such  disposition  on a  balance  sheet of the  owner  of such  asset
        prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles.".
        SECTION 2.  Conditions to  Effectiveness.  This  Amendment  shall become
        effective  when,  and only  when,  the  following  conditions  have been
        fulfilled:
               (a)    the Company and the Required Banks shall have  executed a
counterpart  of this Amendment; and
               (b) the Agent shall have executed a counterpart of this Amendment
and shall have received  counterparts of this Amendment  executed by the Company
and the Required Banks.
        SECTION 3.  Representations  and Warranties True; No Default or Event of
Default.  The Company hereby  represents and warrants to the Agent and the Banks
that after giving effect to the execution and delivery of this Amendment (a) the
representations  and warranties  set forth in the Credit  Agreement are true and
correct  on the date  hereof  as  though  made on and as of such date and (b) no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
        SECTION 4. Reference to the Credit Agreement and Effect on the Notes.
        (a) Upon the  effectiveness  of this  Amendment,  each  reference in the
Credit  Agreement to "this  Agreement,"  "hereunder,"  "herein" or words of like
import  shall mean and be a reference  to the Credit  Agreement,  as amended and
affected hereby.
        (b) Upon the  effectiveness  of this  Amendment,  each  reference in the
Notes to "the  Credit  Agreement"  shall mean and be a  reference  to the Credit
Agreement, as amended and affected hereby.
        (c) The Credit  Agreement and the Notes, as amended and affected hereby,
shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed.
        SECTION 5.  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS  AMENDMENT  SHALL BE GOVERNED  BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND
APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW AND SHALL BE BINDING UPON THE COMPANY,  THE BANKS AND THE
AGENT AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.
        SECTION 6. Descriptive Headings.  The section headings appearing in this
Amendment  have  been  inserted  for  convenience  only  and  shall  be given no
substantive  meaning  or  significance  whatever  in  construing  the  terms and
provisions of this Amendment.
        SECTION  7.  FINAL  AGREEMENT  OF  THE  PARTIES.  THE  CREDIT  AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING THE EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULE THERETO), AS AMENDED HEREBY, THE NOTES, THE
AGENT'S LETTER AND THE OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENTS,  CONSTITUTE A "LOAN  AGREEMENT" AS
DEFINED IN  SECTION  26.02(a)  OF THE TEXAS  BUSINESS  AND  COMMERCE  CODE,  AND
REPRESENT THE FINAL  AGREEMENT  AMONG THE PARTIES  RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF  AND  THEREOF  AND  MAY  NOT  BE   CONTRADICTED  BY  EVIDENCE  OF  PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS  OR  SUBSEQUENT  ORAL  AGREEMENTS  OF THE PARTIES.  THERE ARE NO
UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF
AND THEREOF.
        SECTION 8. Execution in Counterparts.  This Amendment may be executed in
any  number  of  counterparts  and  by  different  parties  hereto  in  separate
counterparts,  each of which when so executed  shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
        IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to be
executed  effective  as of the date first  stated  herein,  by their  respective
officers thereunto duly authorized.
