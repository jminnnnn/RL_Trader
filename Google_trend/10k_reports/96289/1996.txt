    ITEM 1. BUSINESS.


    GENERAL
      Tandy Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated
    in 1967 ("Tandy" or the "Company").  The Company engages in
    the retail sale of consumer electronics including personal
    computers primarily in the United States.  The Company's
    retail operations include the RadioShack(SM), McDuff
    Electronics(R), The Edge in Electronics(R), Computer City(R)
    and Incredible Universe(R) store chains.  See Item 7
    "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
    Operations and Financial Condition" for a discussion of
    divisional sales data.

          RadioShack.  RadioShack is the Company's largest
        operating division.  At December 31, 1995, the RadioShack
        division operated 4,831 company-owned stores, including
        73 stores in the Specialty Retail Group, located
        throughout the United States.  These stores average
        approximately 2,450 square feet in area and are located
        in major malls, strip centers and individual store
        fronts, primarily in metropolitan markets.  To provide
        RadioShack products to smaller communities, RadioShack
        had on the same date a network of 2,005 dealer/franchise
        stores.  The dealers are generally engaged in other
        retail operations and augment their sales with RadioShack
        products.  This network included 69 international dealers
        at December 31, 1995.

          The company-owned RadioShack(SM) stores carry a broad
        assortment of primarily private label electronic parts
        and accessories, audio/video equipment, digital satellite
        systems, personal computers and cellular and conventional
        telephones, as well as specialized products such as
        scanners, electronic toys and hard to find batteries.
        Personal computers, which account for approximately 10.6%
        of the RadioShack division's sales, primarily target
        entry level users seeking computers for home, individual
        and small business use.  RadioShack also provides access
        to third party services such as cellular phone, direct
        satellite programming, pager service and programming from
        other wireless communication providers.  RadioShack plans
        to expand its company-owned store base to 5,000 locations
        by the year 2000.  RadioShack is also focusing on
        Alternative Channels of Distribution ("ACD"), which are
        geared to enhance its "service oriented" approach.  A few
        ACDs include RadioShack Gift Express(SM) and RadioShack
        Unlimited(SM).

          On December 30, 1994, the Company adopted a business
        restructuring plan to close or convert 233 stores which
        included VideoConcepts(R) stores, McDuff Electronics mall
        stores and a small number of McDuff Electronics and
        Appliance Supercenters. The stores were closed during the
        first quarter of 1995.  Of the 233 stores, 151
        VideoConcepts, 30 McDuff mall stores and 19 McDuff
        Supercenters were closed and 33 sites were converted to
        RadioShack or Computer City Express(SM) stores.  On
        January 3, 1995, the Company announced that the Tandy
        Name Brand Retail Group would be dissolved and the 73
        continuing stores would become part of the Tandy
        Specialty Retail Group.  See Item 7 "Management's
        Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
        Financial Condition" and Note 4 of the Notes to
        Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on
        the plan.

          The Company also closed 110 Tandy Name Brand stores in
        the first quarter of 1993.  See Item 7 "Management's
        Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
        Financial Condition" and Note 4 of the Notes to
        Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

          Computer City.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company
        and its subsidiaries had 99 Computer City stores open,
        including five in Europe and six in Canada.  The Computer
        City chain operates primarily as a supercenter format
        featuring many name brand computers, software and related
        products, including IBM, Apple, Sony, Lotus, Borland,
        Microsoft, Packard Bell, Compaq, AST and Hewlett-Packard.
        The eighty-eight Computer City SuperCenters average about
        22,700 square feet and carry approximately 5,000
        products.  At December 31, 1995, there were 11 Computer
        City Express stores which are approximately 12,300 square
        feet and serve smaller markets.  The Company plans to
        open less than 20 additional stores in 1996, which may
        include three Computer City Express stores.

          Incredible Universe.  At December 31, 1995, Tandy and
        its subsidiaries operated 17 Incredible Universe stores.
        These stores are approximately 184,000 square feet and
        offer a broad selection of consumer electronics and
        appliances.  The Company plans to open at least three
        stores in 1996, including a store in Atlanta which will
        open in the first quarter.

      Supporting the retail operations is an extensive
    infrastructure that includes:

          A&A International, Inc. - This wholly-owned subsidiary
        of the Company serves the wide-ranging international
        import/export, sourcing, evaluation, logistics and
        quality control needs of the Company.  A&A also provides
        services for outside customers, such as InterTAN Inc.
        ("InterTAN").  Most of A&A's activity for InterTAN
        involves sourcing of goods from manufacturers in the Far
        East.  For more discussion on InterTAN see Note 22 of the
        Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

          Tandy Service Centers - The Company maintains a large
        service and support network in the consumer electronics
        retail industry.  These centers repair name brand and
        private label products sold through all of the Company's
        retail distribution channels.  These centers are also the
        primary support for The Repair Shop at RadioShack
        program.  At December 31, 1995 there were 139 service
        centers in the U.S. and Canada; however, the Company
        plans to close twelve of these centers in the first
        quarter of 1996.  The Tandy Service division stocks over
        one million parts.

          Regional Distribution Centers - The 14 distribution
        centers operated by the Company ship over 900,000 cartons
        each month to the Company's retail outlets.  This group
        also supports the RadioShack Gift Express and RadioShack
        Unlimited services and Tandy's new cross-docking
        facility.

          Tandy Information Services ("TIS") - TIS collects
        information from the retail stores nationwide and updates
        large databases with sales and other information.  These
        databases are sophisticated marketing tools benefiting
        every phase of the Company's operations.  TIS also
        processes inventory, accounting, payroll,
        telecommunications and other operating information for
        all of the Company's operations.  In addition,
        specialized information is tracked for the Company's
        distribution and corporate activities.

          Tandy Credit Corporation - This operation was a wholly
        owned subsidiary of the Company that helped to support
        sales of the Company's retail operations and provided the
        retail divisions with additional marketing flexibility
        through the utilization of credit promotions.  In the
        past, this group maintained and managed Tandy's various
        private label credit cards.

          In December 1994, the Company sold the Computer City
        and Incredible Universe credit card portfolios to SPS
        Transaction Services, Inc. ("SPS"), a majority-owned
        subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Co.  Effective
        March 30, 1995, the Company also completed the sale of
        the RadioShack and Tandy Name Brand private label credit
        card accounts and substantially all related accounts
        receivable to SPS.  As part of the completed sales
        transaction, Tandy Credit Corporation was merged into
        Hurley Receivables Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary
        of SPS, and no longer exists.  See Item 7 "Management's
        Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
        Financial Condition" and Note 3 of the Notes to
        Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

          Tandy Transportation, Inc. - A large fleet of tractors
        and trailers transports merchandise from manufacturers or
        ports of entry to the Company's regional distribution
        centers and local distribution facilities and also
        delivers to the Company's retail outlets.

          Consumer Electronics Manufacturing - Although the
        Company sold most of its manufacturing operations in 1993
        and 1994, the Company still operates nine manufacturing
        facilities in the United States and one overseas
        manufacturing operation in China, which is a joint
        venture.  These 10 manufacturing facilities cover a total
        of 1,330,000 square feet and employed approximately 3,000
        workers and professionals as of December 31, 1995.  The
        Company manufactures a variety of products for use in its
        consumer electronics retailing operations.  These
        products include audio, video, telephony, antennas, wire
        and cable products and a wide variety of hard to find
        parts for consumer electronic products.  Most of the
        Company's manufacturing output is sold through the
        RadioShack store chain.  The Taiwan manufacturing plant
        was closed in the first half of 1995 and its products are
        now being manufactured by the China operations.

    SEASONALITY
      As is the case with other retail businesses, the Company's
    net sales and other revenues are greater during the Christmas
    season than during other periods of the year.  There is a
    corresponding pre-seasonal inventory build-up requiring
    working capital associated with the anticipated increased
    sales volume.  For additional information, see Note 23 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

    PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
      Tandy owns or is licensed to use many trademarks related to
    its business in the United States and in foreign countries.
    Radio Shack, RadioShack, Computer City, Incredible Universe,
    McDuff Electronics, Famous Brand Electronics and Optimus are
    some of the registered marks most widely used by the Company.
    Tandy believes that the RadioShack, Computer City and
    Incredible Universe names and marks are well-recognized by
    consumers, and that these names and marks are associated with
    high-quality service providers.  The Company's products are
    sold primarily under the RadioShack, Optimus and U.S. Logic
    trademarks which are registered in the U.S. and many foreign
    countries.  The Company believes that the loss of the Radio
    Shack name or mark would be material to its business, but
    does not believe that the loss of any one trademark
    registration would be material.

      Tandy also owns various patents relating to retail and
    support functions and various products which Tandy has
    previously designed and continues to manufacture.

    SUPPLIERS
      The Company obtains merchandise from a large number of
    suppliers from various parts of the world.  Alternative
    sources of supply exist for most merchandise and raw
    materials purchased by the Company.  As the Company's product
    line is diverse, the Company would not expect a lack of
    availability of any single product or raw material to have a
    material impact on its operations.  During 1995, the Company
    sold approximately $185,000,000 of IBM computer products
    which accounted for approximately 17% of total computer
    hardware product sales within the Company.  The increase in
    sales of IBM computer hardware products is mainly due to a
    contract between IBM and the RadioShack division regarding
    sales of IBM Aptiva products.  The exclusive IBM Aptiva
    agreement terminated on December 1, 1995.  Management does
    not believe that the loss of this one supplier would have a
    material impact on its operations.

    BACKLOG ORDERS
      The Company has no material backlog of orders for the
    products it sells.

    COMPETITION
      The consumer electronics retail business is highly
    competitive.  The Company competes in the sale of its
    products and services with department stores, mail order
    houses, discount stores, general merchants, home appliance
    stores and gift stores which sell comparable products
    manufactured by others.  Competitors range in size from local
    drug and hardware stores to large chains and department
    stores.  Computer store chains and franchise groups, as well
    as independent computer stores and several major retailers,
    compete with the Company in the retail personal computer
    marketplace.  Consumer electronics and computer mail-order
    companies also compete with the Company.  The products which
    compete with those sold by the Company are manufactured by
    numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers.  Many of these
    products carry nationally recognized brand names or private
    labels and are sold in markets common to the Company.  Some
    of the Company's competitors have financial resources equal
    to or greater than the Company's resources.

      Management believes that the many factors important to its
    competitive position are price, quality, service and the
    broad selection of electronic products and computers carried
    at conveniently located retail outlets.  The Company's
    utilization of trained personnel and its ability to use
    national and local advertising media are important to the
    Company's ability to compete in the consumer electronics
    marketplace.  Management of the Company believes it is a
    strong competitor with respect to each of the factors
    referenced above.  Given the highly competitive nature of the
    consumer electronics retail business, no assurance can be
    given that the Company will continue to compete successfully
    with respect to each of the factors referenced above.  Also,
    the Company would be adversely affected if its competitors
    were to offer their products at significantly lower prices,
    introduce innovative or technologically superior products not
    yet available to the Company or if the Company were unable to
    obtain products in a timely manner for an extended period of
    time.

      The Company focuses on various types of store formats to
    address the marketplace.  Each of the Company's retailing
    formats uses a distinct but complementary path to the
    marketplace, based on its unique customer appeal, marketing
    strengths and margin structure.

            RadioShack.  RadioShack stores offer the shopping
            convenience of approximately 6,800 dealer and
            company-owned stores, primarily private label
            high-quality products, unique selection,
            knowledgeable personnel and excellent customer
            service, including its "service-oriented" approach.
            RadioShack has formed strategic alliances with key
            vendors in computers, home security and wireless
            communications to augment the strong position that it
            has historically maintained in core product
            categories such as batteries, communications
            equipment, antennas and electronic components and
            accessories.

            The Specialty Retail Group of RadioShack is comprised
            of 94 retail outlets, including 73 units that have
            been integrated from the now closed Tandy Name Brand
            division.  The Tandy Specialty Retail Group carries
            name brand consumer electronics and appliances
            through four distinctly different types of store
            formats.

            Computer City.  Computer City stores offer
            approximately 5,000 different name brand items, great
            prices and world-class customer service on computers,
            computer software and accessories.  While the
            SuperCenters average approximately 22,700 square
            feet, Computer City Express stores average 12,300
            square feet, serve smaller markets and also
            supplement SuperCenters in larger markets.

            Incredible Universe.  Incredible Universe gigastores
            provide the customer with a "universe" of choices
            with approximately 184,000 square feet of over 85,000
            different stock-keeping units, including name brand
            consumer electronics and appliances.

      The Company has faced intense competition in its consumer
    electronics retailing businesses.  Competition is driven by
    technology and product cycles, as well as the economy.  In
    the consumer electronics retailing business, competitive
    factors include price, product quality, product features,
    consumer services, manufacturing and distribution capability
    and brand reputation.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
      Research and development expenditures are not significant.

    EMPLOYEES
      As of December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately
    49,300 employees.  The preceding number includes
    approximately 4,000 temporary retail employees which were
    hired for the Christmas selling season.  Management of the
    Company considers the relationship between the Company and
    its employees to be good.  It does not anticipate any work
    stoppage due to labor difficulties.


    ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
      Information on the Company's properties is in "Management's
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
    Financial Condition" and the financial statements included in
    this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.  The
    following items are discussed further on the referenced
    pages:

                                        Page
        Retail Outlets                   15
        Property, Plant and Equipment    43
        Leases                           45

      The Company leases rather than owns most of its retail
    facilities. However, the buildings of five Incredible
    Universe stores are owned rather than leased.  The land and
    building of one Computer City store are owned by the Company.
    The RadioShack and Computer City stores are located primarily
    in major shopping malls, stand-alone buildings or shopping
    centers owned by other companies.  The Company owns most of
    the property on which its executive offices are located in
    Fort Worth, Texas, as well as six distribution facilities and
    most of its manufacturing facilities and land located
    throughout the United States.  Existing warehouse and office
    facilities are deemed adequate to meet the Company's needs in
    the foreseeable future.

    ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
      The Company is a defendant in a consolidated action titled
    O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation,
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    which was commenced in 1994 and is currently pending before
    the United States District Court for the Western District of
    Missouri.  The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified
    amount alleging that the initial public offering of
    O'Sullivan, which was formerly a subsidiary of the Company,
    as well as certain press releases and other materials,
    contained material misrepresentations and omissions.  The
    parties have recently entered into a Memorandum of
    Understanding which anticipates the settlement of this
    litigation in the near future.  The complete resolution of
    the matter is dependent upon the satisfaction of several
    conditions including the parties entering a binding agreement
    and the Court approving the terms of such an agreement. 
    There can be no assurance that such an agreement will be
    reached or that Court approval will be obtained.  Under the
    terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the Company's
    contributions to the proposed settlement will not have a
    material adverse affect on its results of operations or
    financial condition.  Tandy believes that the lawsuit is
    totally without merit and in the event this matter is not
    resolved, as is presently anticipated, the Company intends to
    resume its vigorous defense of this lawsuit.

      Tandy has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third
    parties, investigations and pending actions involving
    allegations of negligence, product defects, discrimination,
    infringement of intellectual property rights, securities
    matters, tax deficiencies, violations of permits or licenses,
    and breach of contract and other matters against the Company
    and its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its
    business.  The liability, if any, associated with these
    matters was not determinable at December 31, 1995.  While
    certain of these matters involve substantial amounts, and
    although occasional adverse settlements or resolutions may
    occur and negatively impact earnings in the year of
    settlement, it is the opinion of management that their
    ultimate resolution will not have a materially adverse effect
    on Tandy's financial position.

    </TABLE>


      For the year ended December 31, 1995, Tandy Corporation's
    ("Tandy" or the "Company") sales increased 18% to
    $5,839,067,000 from $4,943,679,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 1994.  The increase in sales was primarily
    attributable to the addition of 160 RadioShack(SM) stores
    (net of closures), eight Incredible Universe(R) stores and 30
    Computer City(R) stores during 1995.  Due to the closure of
    233 Tandy Name Brand Retail Group ("Tandy Name Brand") stores
    during the first quarter of 1995, sales for that division
    decreased from $271,504,000 to $28,041,000.  This division is
    now closed and sales of the remaining Tandy Name Brand stores
    are included in the RadioShack total for each period
    presented in the table above.

      For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company showed
    approximately 5% same store sales growth, with all divisions
    showing same store sales increases during the year.  The
    RadioShack division achieved 6% same store sales growth,
    while Incredible Universe and Computer City each had same
    store sales increases of 2%.

      Same store sales increases (decreases) for the quarter
    ended December 31, 1995 for RadioShack, Computer City and
    Incredible Universe were 5%, (6%) and less than 1%,
    respectively.  RadioShack's increased sales for the year and
    the quarter reflected the increasing demand for cellular
    phones.  Cellular phone commissions increased in 1995 by
    approximately $150,000,000 as compared to 1994.  In addition,
    sales of its core products also increased, reflecting the
    results of new advertising campaigns.  Same store sales at
    Computer City for the fourth quarter declined primarily
    because of lower than anticipated demand for personal
    computers at its stores.  Computer City and Incredible
    Universe are reevaluating their advertising plans, customer
    service and other marketing strategies in an effort to
    increase same store sales in 1996.  For example, new programs
    being instituted at Computer City include a commissioned
    sales program, a 110% price guarantee, increased emphasis on
    being adequately stocked in advertised and fast-moving
    merchandise, strengthened infrastructure and support for
    corporate sales and the development and training of store
    personnel.  At Incredible Universe a number of volume and
    traffic building programs have been introduced for 1996.
    These include new advertising programs that better represent
    the broad scope of Incredible Universe and increase focus on
    our differentiating strengths such as demonstrations, vendor
    seminars, clinics and community events.  Also, increased
    utilization of space is being planned to increase sales per
    square foot.

      RadioShack sales in 1995 of consumer electronics and
    cellular commissions, as a percentage of overall sales, rose
    modestly while the percentage of overall sales attributable
    to personal computers and electronic parts, accessories and
    specialty equipment decreased.  The decrease in RadioShack's
    computer business reflected the impact of sharply lower
    pricing in response to competitive pressures in the
    marketplace.  The changing dynamics of the personal computer
    business had a significant impact on RadioShack's sales
    performance during 1993, and to a lesser extent in 1994 and
    1995.  A combination of shifts in retail distribution to
    computer superstores, large consumer electronics store
    formats and telemarketing combined with rapidly declining
    prices has taken the computer category from approximately
    14.2% of RadioShack's sales and a gross profit of
    approximately 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 1993 to
    approximately 10.6% of sales and a gross profit of
    approximately 11.8% for the year ended December 31, 1995.  It
    is anticipated that personal computer sales should be between
    10% and 12% of RadioShack's business in 1996.  The table
    below shows the breakdown by major category of RadioShack
    sales.

      During 1994, Tandy and InterTAN Inc. ("InterTAN") entered
    into a new import/export agreement under which Tandy's A&A
    International ("A&A") operations would act as InterTAN's
    agent in importing consumer electronics from the Far East.
    Commencing in March 1994, only the purchasing agent
    commission and sales made by Tandy manufacturing plants to
    InterTAN were recorded as sales.  InterTAN purchases from
    third parties through A&A are no longer recorded as sales,
    reflecting the arrangement under the new merchandise
    agreement; however, commission income is reported as
    operating revenue.  Accordingly, reported sales by Tandy to
    InterTAN in 1995 and 1994, reflected in Other Sales, were
    considerably lower than in 1993; however, the earned income
    relating thereto was not materially different.  See the
    discussion in the "InterTAN Update" found below.

      Tandy's sales increased 21% to $4,943,679,000 in 1994 from
    $4,102,551,000 in 1993.  The increase in sales was primarily
    attributable to the addition of six Incredible Universe and
    29 Computer City stores during 1994.  A net increase of 45
    RadioShack stores also contributed to the sales increase.
    Partially offsetting these upward trends in sales was an
    overall decline in sales for Tandy Name Brand.  This decline
    can be partially attributed to the fact that 110 McDuff(R)
    and VideoConcepts(R) stores were closed during February 1993.
    See "Provision for Business Restructuring" below for further
    discussion of Tandy Name Brand.

      During 1994, Tandy posted a 5% same store sales increase.
    RadioShack and Computer City achieved same store sales
    increases of 5% while the Tandy Name Brand group was up only
    slightly.  Incredible Universe, with three old stores,
    experienced a 20% comparable stores sales gain during
    calendar 1994.  Same store sales increases reflected growing
    demand for consumer electronics and a strong economy.

    (1)  As of January 1, 1995, the Specialty Retail Group of the
    RadioShack division included 73 Tandy Name Brand units.

    (2)  In the first quarter of 1995, 151 VideoConcepts, 30
    McDuff mall stores and 19 McDuff Supercenters were closed.
    In addition, 33 other mall stores or Supercenters were
    converted into RadioShack or Computer City Express(SM)
    stores. See "Provision for Business Restructuring".

    GROSS PROFIT
      Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 39.0%
    in 1994 to 35.5% in 1995.  This decrease reflects the
    continued expansion of Tandy's lower gross margin retail
    formats. During calendar year 1995, Computer City and
    Incredible Universe represented 42.9% of total sales and
    operating revenues compared to 31.7% of the 1994 total.
    Management anticipates that Tandy's consolidated gross profit
    percentage will continue to decline as the effects of the
    Computer City and Incredible Universe expansions are
    increasingly reflected in the revenue and gross profit mix.

      During 1995 RadioShack's gross margin decreased when
    compared to 1994 due to the rapid growth of cellular phone
    and digital satellite system sales.  It is anticipated that
    RadioShack's gross margin as a percentage of sales in 1996
    could be equal to or slightly exceed the comparable 1995
    figure due to emphasis on higher margin categories.  Computer
    City's gross margin remained relatively flat in 1995 when
    compared to 1994.  Competitive forces have continued to play
    a major factor in keeping margins flat in 1995.  Margins are
    not expected to vary much in 1996 as these competitive forces
    in the marketplace remain in place and may even increase in
    some quarters.  Incredible Universe's gross margins decreased
    slightly in 1995 compared to 1994 reflecting the fact that
    personal computers and related equipment, which inherently
    have lower margins, contributed a larger portion to the
    overall sales mix in 1995 versus 1994.  This trend is
    expected to continue in 1996.

      Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined in 1994 to
    39.0% from the 1993 level of 41.9%.  Expansion of the
    Computer City and Incredible Universe store formats impacted
    gross margin during these years.  During 1994, Computer City
    and Incredible Universe represented 31.7% of total sales and
    operating revenues compared to 18.6% of the 1993 total.
    Offsetting the mix of business shift within Tandy were the
    increasing gross margins at RadioShack in 1994, which
    continued to benefit from a lower percentage of sales related
    to low margin computer equipment and a higher percentage
    associated with the sale of higher gross margin categories
    including parts, accessories and consumer electronics.

    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
      Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") as a
    percentage of sales and operating revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 1995 declined from the years ended December 31,
    1994 and 1993.  The accompanying table summarizes the
    breakdown of various components of SG&A and their related
    percentage of sales and operating revenues.  The lower SG&A
    percentage reflects the lower costs, relative to net sales
    and operating revenues, of the Company's newer retail formats
    (Computer City and Incredible Universe), as well as the lower
    operating costs achieved through cost reduction programs.

      In comparison with the prior year, payroll and commissions
    expense for 1995 decreased as a percentage of total sales and
    operating revenues while the dollar amounts increased from
    year to year.  The decrease as a percentage of sales is due
    to the increase in combined Computer City and Incredible
    Universe sales as a percentage of total sales and operating
    revenues from 31.7% in 1994 to 42.9% in 1995.  These
    divisions have an inherently lower salary structure when
    compared to the total company.

      Advertising costs for 1995 have decreased slightly as a
    percentage of sales, while the dollar amounts have increased
    since 1994.  The increase in advertising costs relates to the
    addition of 30 new Computer City and eight Incredible
    Universe stores during 1995 and, therefore, increased
    marketing efforts in these new markets.  Additionally,
    RadioShack incurred minor advertising expense increases
    primarily relating to inflation.

      Rent expense in 1995 decreased as a percentage of sales in
    comparison with the prior year, while the dollar amounts
    remained relatively stable.  This decrease as a percentage of
    sales directly relates to the closing of Tandy Name Brand
    stores and the increase in the number of Computer City and
    Incredible Universe stores, as they have lower rent expense
    as a percentage of sales than the Company as a whole.  The
    relatively stable dollar amount is the result of the
    reduction in rent expenses related to the 233 closed Tandy
    Name Brand units offset by the rent of the additional
    RadioShack, Computer City and Incredible Universe stores.

      The expenses of the credit operations have significantly
    declined as a result of the sale of the private label credit
    card portfolios which was completed by March 31, 1995.

      The sale of the credit card portfolio balance has
    eliminated most of the risk of uncollectible accounts
    receivable, thereby significantly reducing the bad debt
    provision during 1995 as compared to prior years.  In
    addition, servicing costs associated with the portfolio have
    also been eliminated with the sale.  These factors were the
    primary contributors to the decrease in the expenses of the
    credit operations.  Offsetting these reductions are decreased
    interest income (see discussion below) resulting from the
    credit card portfolio sale.  Commencing in 1995, the Company
    receives fees from an unrelated third party financier of its
    private label credit card portfolio balance for the
    generation of normal interest bearing accounts, and pays a
    fee for the generation of special purpose promotional
    accounts, such as "zero percent interest for twelve months".
    These fees are classified in Credit card fees in the
    accompanying SG&A table and are the primary reason for the
    increase in this category in 1995 versus 1994.  Credit card
    fees expense also includes fees associated with third party
    bank credit cards.

      Other SG&A expenses increased $22,728,000 in 1995 to
    $178,636,000, primarily relating to store growth.

      Although payroll and commissions expense for 1994 increased
    in dollars in comparison with 1993, this cost decreased as a
    percentage of sales and operating revenues.  This was due to
    the increase in Computer City and Incredible Universe sales
    as a percentage of total sales and operating revenues from
    18.6% in 1993 to 31.7% in 1994; these divisions have an
    inherently lower salary structure when compared to
    RadioShack.  In addition, Computer City payroll expense as a
    percentage of Computer City sales decreased from 1993 to
    1994, while that of the other retail divisions has remained
    approximately the same from year to year.

      Advertising costs decreased as a percentage of sales and
    operating revenues in the year ended December 31, 1994 as
    compared to the year ended December 31, 1993.  Management
    focused its efforts on more efficient advertising methods for
    RadioShack, utilizing the Company's database of customer
    activity to reduce costs while maintaining market awareness.
    Advertising costs increased in dollars compared to the prior
    year as new Computer City and Incredible Universe stores
    opened and RadioShack shifted its marketing program to
    electronic media.  The Company spent approximately 30% of its
    advertising funds for television and radio commercials,
    compared to 20% in previous years.  RadioShack's advertising
    spots were shifted from sports-related events to prime-time
    shows in order to reach a broader audience.

      Rent expense increased slightly in dollars but decreased as
    a percentage of sales during the year ended December 31, 1994
    as compared to the year ended December 31, 1993.  The
    increase in rent expense was due to a net increase of 45
    RadioShack stores and the addition of 29 Computer City stores
    and six Incredible Universe stores.  Incredible Universe and
    Computer City formats typically have lower rent, as a
    percentage of sales, than Tandy overall.

      The Company's credit operations were successful in
    supporting sales of the retail operations during 1994 and
    1993.  Private label credit cards represented 35% of credit
    sales for the year ended December 31, 1994 and 34% for the
    year ended December 31, 1993.  Expenses associated with the
    credit card operations, which are included in SG&A expense,
    decreased as a percentage of sales during this period because
    of a decrease in credit losses which reflected a stronger
    economy.  As discussed above, the Company sold its Computer
    City and Incredible Universe private label credit card
    portfolios in 1994 and in the first quarter of 1995 sold its
    RadioShack and McDuff private label credit card portfolios.

      Credit card fees in 1994 increased over that in 1993
    primarily due to an increase in discount fees paid to third
    party bank cards because of both increased sales in the
    Computer City and Incredible Universe formats and an increase
    in credit card sales as a percentage of sales.

      Other SG&A expenses increased $45,774,000 from 1993 to
    1994.  RadioShack merchandise repair expenses increased
    $8,261,000 in 1994 primarily reflecting an increase in
    extended service plan sales.  The change in other SG&A also
    reflects the $6,047,000 gain on the 1993 sale of the
    Company's interests in two cellular telephone manufacturing
    joint ventures, the $1,796,000 realized loss on the sale of
    the cellular joint ventures included in the 1993 foreign
    currency transactions and an increase in attorney fees of
    $4,671,000 in 1994.

    DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
      Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of
    sales and operating revenues decreased slightly in the year
    ended December 31, 1995 as compared with the years ended
    December 31, 1994 and 1993.  The dollar amount of
    depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended
    December 31, 1995 increased 8.5% over the dollar amount for
    the year ended December 31, 1994 and 15.1% over the dollar
    amount in 1993. The increase was due to additional capital
    expenditures related to new stores added in the past two
    years.  This increase was partially offset by the closure of
    the Tandy Name Brand stores previously discussed.  In 1995
    the Company added 160 RadioShack stores (net of closings),
    eight Incredible Universe stores and 30 Computer City stores.
    Six Incredible Universe stores, 29 Computer City stores and
    45 RadioShack stores (net of closings) were added during
    1994, thereby increasing depreciation and amortization from
    1993 to 1994.

                                   =======    =======    =======


      Net interest income was $8,616,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 1995, $48,565,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 1994 and $25,831,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 1993.  The decrease in interest income is
    directly attributable to the sale of the Company's private
    label credit card portfolios in the December quarter of 1994
    and the March quarter of 1995.

      Interest income in 1994 and 1993 was primarily attributable
    to the Company's credit card operations.  Increased short-
    term investments in 1994 resulted from proceeds received from
    the divestiture of discontinued manufacturing and marketing
    operations, as well as from cash provided by operating
    activities.

      Interest income from the credit card operations decreased
    in 1995 due to the sale of the Company's credit card
    portfolios.  As a result of the sale of the Computer City and
    Incredible Universe credit card portfolios in 1994 and the
    RadioShack and McDuff credit card portfolios in 1995, the
    Company will no longer earn interest income from these
    portfolios.  Interest income for 1995 includes the amount of
    interest received prior to the sale of the RadioShack and
    McDuff portfolios.  The decrease in interest income from the
    credit card operations from 1993 to 1994 was a result of
    increased use of certain special sales promotions and
    marketing initiatives, some of which provided for no interest
    charges for specified initial periods.  The decline in
    average credit card receivables in 1994 resulted from
    increased payments from credit customers reflecting the
    overall improvement in the economy and a desire by consumers
    to shift debt to lower interest rate instruments.

      Other interest income relates primarily to short-term
    investments of the Company.  The AST Research, Inc. ("AST")
    note will mature in July 1996 and, therefore, interest income
    derived therefrom will be less in 1996 than in previous
    years.  Interest income relating to the InterTAN notes will
    continue in 1996.  The Company does not anticipate  interest
    income relating to settlements with the IRS in 1996.

      The increase in interest expense for the year ended
    December 31, 1995 as compared to the year ended December 31,
    1994 is due to an increase in the use of short-term borrowing
    facilities.  The use of these facilities was significantly
    higher during the year ended December 31, 1995 as the Company
    retired long-term debt, funded store expansion and funded the
    share repurchase program.  Even though short-term debt
    outstanding at the end of the year decreased 17.1%, the
    weighted average of seasonal bank loans outstanding during
    the year increased from $16,358,000 in 1994 to $106,963,000
    in 1995, and the weighted average interest rate rose from
    5.2% in 1994 to 6.2% in 1995.  Assuming interest rates do not
    change significantly, it is anticipated that the weighted
    average of short-term debt used during 1996 will increase as
    compared to that used in 1995 due to a greater need for funds
    for the share repurchase and store expansion programs.
    Although a portion of the funds will be met with cash flows
    from operations, proceeds from the AST note due in July 1996
    and continuing principal payments from the InterTAN notes
    receivable, the Company still anticipates that a portion will
    be met through increased debt borrowings.  As a result , the
    Company expects to incur net interest expense in 1996.  Long-
    term debt decreased 8.2% from December 31, 1994 due to the
    repayment of debt such as medium-term notes and senior notes.
    During 1995, a significant portion of the cash proceeds
    received from the sale of the credit operations was applied
    to the funding of store expansion and repurchase of the final
    7,500,000 shares under the completed 12,500,000 share
    repurchase program.

    PROVISION FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING
      In December 1994, the Company adopted a business
    restructuring plan to close or convert 233 of the 306 Tandy
    Name Brand stores.  At March 31, 1995 all 233 stores had been
    closed or converted.  The remaining stores have become part
    of the Tandy Specialty Retail Group of RadioShack.  A pre-tax
    charge of $89,071,000 was taken in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 1994 related to the closing and conversion of these
    stores.  The components of the restructuring charge and an
    analysis of the amounts charged against the reserve are
    outlined in a table in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

      Sales and operating revenues and operating losses
    associated with the closed Tandy Name Brand stores in 1995
    approximated $28,041,000 and $3,064,000 respectively.  Sales
    and operating revenues associated with the closed Tandy Name
    Brand stores approximated $261,990,000 and $271,914,000 for
    1994 and 1993, respectively, and operating losses
    approximated $18,125,000 and $15,342,000 for 1994 and 1993,
    respectively.  In conjunction with this restructuring, 1,425
    employees were terminated, most of whom were store employees.

    GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS AND EXTENDED SERVICE
    CONTRACTS
      In December 1994, the Company entered into an agreement
    with SPS Transaction Services, Inc., a majority-owned
    subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Company ("SPS") to sell
    its Computer City and Incredible Universe private label
    credit card portfolios without recourse.  As a result of the
    agreement, Tandy received cash of $85,764,000 and received a
    deferred payment of $179,777,000.  The Company recognized a
    gain of $35,708,000 in the accompanying 1994 Consolidated
    Statements of Income.  The deferred payment amount did not
    bear interest.  The total principal amount of $179,777,000
    was paid in full during 1995.  The Company discounted the
    deferred payment by $3,477,000 to yield interest income of
    approximately 5% over the twelve month payout period.

      On March 30, 1995, the Company completed the sale, at net
    book value, of the RadioShack and Tandy Name Brand private
    label credit card accounts and substantially all related
    accounts receivable to Hurley State Bank, a subsidiary of
    SPS.  As a result of the transaction, Tandy received
    $342,822,000 in cash and a deferred payment amount of
    $49,444,000.  The deferred payment does not bear interest and
    principal is paid monthly with final payment due February 29,
    1996.  The remaining discounted deferred payment balance of
    $2,098,000 is classified as a current receivable in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1995.

      Effective December 1994, the Company transferred all of its
    existing obligations with respect to extended service
    contracts in force at December 31, 1994, with the exception
    of certain contracts aggregating approximately $7,734,000, to
    an unrelated third party.  The unrelated third party
    contractually assumed all of the Company's legal obligations
    and risk of future loss pursuant to the extended service
    contracts in exchange for $75,059,000.  As a result, the
    Company recognized a gain of $55,729,000 associated with this
    transaction in its accompanying 1994 Consolidated Statements
    of Income.  The Company continues to provide repair services
    to customers who tender products pursuant to the extended
    service contracts on a non-exclusive basis.  The unrelated
    third party pays the Company competitive market rates for
    repairs on products tendered pursuant to the extended service
    contracts.

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
      The effective tax rate was 38.25% for the year ended
    December 31, 1995, 37.6% for the year ended December 31,1994
    and 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 1993.  The increase
    in the effective tax rates for these years reflects shifts of
    income into states with higher income tax rates such as
    California, New York and Ohio.

      The IRS Dallas field office is reviewing the Company's
    1987-1989 tax returns and has referred certain issues to the
    IRS National office.  The resolution of this matter, which
    raises questions about the private letter rulings issued by
    the IRS regarding the spin-off of InterTAN and certain other
    tax matters, could result in additional taxes and interest to
    the Company.  Although aggregate additional taxes involved in
    these transactions could potentially range from $0 to $27
    million, based on the advice of the Company's independent tax
    advisors, the Company believes it would prevail if any tax
    litigation was instituted.  Any ultimate tax assessment would
    also include interest expense.  In any event, the Company
    believes the ultimate resolution would have no material
    impact on the Company's financial condition.

    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
      On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy adopted a
    formal plan of divestiture under which the Company would sell
    its computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the
    O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ("O'Sullivan") ready-to-assemble
    furniture manufacturing and related marketing business, the
    Memtek Products division and the Lika printed circuit board
    business.

          Computer Manufacturing. The Company closed the sale
        of the computer manufacturing and marketing
        businesses to AST on July 13, 1993.  In accordance
        with the terms of the definitive agreement between
        Tandy and AST, Tandy received $15,000,000 upon
        closing of the sale.  The balance of the purchase
        price of $96,720,000 was payable by a promissory
        note. The Company has discounted this note by
        $2,000,000 and the discount continues to be
        recognized as interest income using the effective
        interest rate method over the life of the note.

          During the quarter ended September 30, 1995, the
        Company received $6,720,000 from AST as a prepayment
        on its promissory note.  The original promissory note
        was supported by a standby letter of credit in the
        amount of the lesser of $100,000,000 or 70% of the
        outstanding principal amount of the promissory note.
        This letter of credit has been replaced by a
        $75,000,000 Letter of Guarantee dated August 22,
        1995, from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a Korean
        corporation, or, alternatively, Samsung Electronics
        America, Inc., a New York corporation.  As of
        December 31, 1995, Samsung owned approximately 40% of
        AST's outstanding stock.  Samsung's current credit
        ratings by S&P and Moody's are A- and Baa1,
        respectively.

          As a result of the prepayment, the note has been
        amended and the principal amount reduced to
        $90,000,000.  The terms of the original promissory
        note stipulated that the outstanding principal
        balance could be paid on July 11, 1996 at AST's
        option in cash or the common stock of AST, provided
        that not more than 50% of the original principal
        amount of the note could be paid in common stock of
        AST.  The amended promissory note provides that AST
        may repay the note in AST common stock, provided that
        not more than the lesser of (a) $30,000,000, or (b)
        33% of the outstanding principal amount of the note
        at the time of payment may be payable by AST in
        common stock of AST.  The interest rate on the
        promissory note is currently 5% per annum and is
        adjusted annually, not to exceed 5% per annum.
        Interest is accrued and paid annually.

          Memtek Products.  On November 10, 1993, the Company
        executed a definitive agreement with Hanny Magnetics
        (B.V.I.) Limited, a British Virgin Islands
        corporation ("Hanny"), to sell certain assets of the
        Company's Memtek Products operations, including the
        license agreement with Memorex Telex, N.V. for the
        use of the Memorex trademark on licensed consumer
        electronics products.  This sale closed on
        December 16, 1993.  Proceeds from this sale
        aggregated $69,602,000.

          O'Sullivan Industries.  On January 27, 1994, the
        Company announced that it had reached an agreement
        with the underwriters to sell all the common stock of
        O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc., the parent
        company of O'Sullivan, to the public at $22 per
        share.  The net proceeds realized by Tandy in the
        initial public offering, together with a $40,000,000
        cash dividend from O'Sullivan, approximated
        $350,000,000.  The initial public offering closed on
        February 2, 1994.

          Tandy has recognized income of approximately
        $1,335,000 and $4,399,000, net of tax, during the
        years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively,
        pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit
        Reimbursement Agreement (the "Agreement") between
        Tandy and O'Sullivan.  Under the Agreement Tandy
        receives payments from O'Sullivan approximating the
        federal tax benefit that O'Sullivan realizes from the
        increased tax basis of its assets resulting from the
        initial public offering.  The higher tax basis
        increases O'Sullivan's tax deductions and,
        accordingly, reduces income taxes payable by
        O'Sullivan.  These payments will be made over a 15-
        year time period and are contingent upon O'Sullivan's
        taxable income each year.  The Company is recognizing
        these payments as additional sale proceeds and gain
        in the year in which the payments become due and
        payable to the Company pursuant to the Agreement.
        The additional gain is recorded as a reduction of
        SG&A expense in the accompanying Consolidated
        Statements of Income.

          Lika.  On October 11, 1994, Tandy sold the assets
        used in its Lika(R) printed circuit board division to
        Viktron Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited
        partnership.  The proceeds from the sale and
        liquidation of assets approximated $16,380,000 which
        included $7,754,000 in cash, proceeds from
        liquidation of retained assets of $5,594,000 and
        secured promissory notes for $3,032,000.  At December
        31, 1995, $1,400,000 remained as a receivable from
        Viktron.

    CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY
                                        Year Ended
                                       December 31,
                            -----------------------------------

    --------------          ---------    ---------    ---------
    Operating activities    $ 672,994    $ 268,938    $ 322,294
    Investing activities     (180,347)     236,620     (57,464)
    Financing activities     (554,782)    (513,160)    (164,221)



      Tandy's cash flow and liquidity, in management's opinion,
    remains strong.  During the year ended December 31, 1995,
    cash provided by operations was $672,994,000 as compared to
    $268,938,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994.

      The increased cash flow from operations was due mainly to
    the cash received from the sale of the credit card
    portfolios, which approximated $342,822,000, collection of
    the deferred payment amount from SPS of $179,777,000 and
    liquidation of remaining unsold private label credit card
    balances.  Inventory required less cash in 1995 than in 1994
    due to liquidation of Tandy Name Brand inventory related to
    closing stores and a net reduction in Computer City inventory
    which was partially offset by increases in inventory to
    support Incredible Universe and RadioShack store expansion,
    while accounts payable and accrued expenses and income taxes
    required $376,349,000 more cash in 1995 than in 1994.

      During the year ended December 31, 1994, cash provided by
    operations decreased from $322,294,000 in 1993 to
    $268,938,000.  The decreased cash flow from operations was
    due partially to the financing of receivables and inventories
    related to the expansion of Computer City and Incredible
    Universe store chains.  The increase of $261,071,000 in cash
    used to fund accounts receivable was due primarily to the
    increase in Tandy Credit receivables related to increased
    retail sales by Computer City and Incredible Universe and the
    use of certain special sales promotions and marketing
    initiatives, some of which provided for no interest charges
    for specified initial periods.  Inventory required
    $156,129,000 more cash in 1994 than in 1993, relating to new
    store openings and increases in average inventory to ensure
    in-stock positions throughout the Christmas selling season.
    Partially offsetting the cash used to finance receivables and
    inventory were the sale of the Computer City and Incredible
    Universe private label credit card portfolios which provided
    cash of $85,764,000 as well as increases in accounts payable,
    accrued expenses and income taxes which provided $184,017,000
    more cash in 1994 than in 1993.  The 1994 increase in
    accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes is net of
    the cash expended of approximately $70,702,000 associated
    with the transfer of the legal obligation and risk of loss
    for existing extended service contracts to an unrelated third
    party.

      Investing activities involved capital expenditures
    primarily for retail expansion totaling $226,511,000 for the
    year ended December 31, 1995, $180,559,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 1994, and $129,287,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 1993.  Proceeds from the sale of property, plant
    and equipment in 1995 and 1994 resulted primarily from sale-
    leaseback transactions involving certain Incredible Universe
    stores which netted the Company $37,550,000 and $52,719,000,
    respectively, in cash.  Prepayment of a portion of the note
    receivable from AST amounted to $6,720,000 in 1995.  Proceeds
    received from the sale of divested operations totaled
    $359,004,000 and $111,988,000 during the years ended
    December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  See "Discontinued
    Operations".  Investing activities in 1993 also included
    $31,663,000 for the purchase of InterTAN's bank debt and the
    extension and funding of a working capital line of credit.
    See "InterTAN Update" for further information.  Future store
    expansions and refurbishments and other capital expenditures
    such as updated POS and information systems are expected to
    approximate $150,000,000 to $160,000,000 per year over the
    next two years and will be funded primarily from available
    cash and cash flow from operations.  The Company's cash flow
    from investing activities will be impacted in 1996 by the
    maturity of the AST note and note payments from InterTAN.  It
    is not anticipated that additional stores in 1996 will
    materially impact inventory levels.

      Purchases of treasury stock used cash of $502,239,000,
    $275,415,000 and $27,650,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
    respectively.  Increases in treasury stock purchases in 1995
    and 1994 related primarily to the share repurchase program.
    See "Capital Structure and Financial Condition" for further
    discussion.  Sales of treasury stock to the Company's Stock
    Purchase Program generated cash of $44,623,000, $41,579,000
    and $42,067,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
    Dividends paid, net of tax, in 1995, 1994 and 1993 amounted
    to $62,991,000, $74,512,000 and $74,873,000, respectively. As
    a result of the Company calling for the redemption of its
    $2.14 Depositary Shares of the Company's Series C Preferred
    Equity Redemption Convertible Stock ("PERCS") in March 1995,
    the Company eliminated its annual dividend payment to the
    PERCS shareholders of approximately $32,000,000.  However, it
    paid upon conversion a cash dividend to the PERCS
    shareholders of approximately $0.321 for each depositary
    share, representing the accrued dividend from January 16,
    1995 through the redemption date of March 10, 1995.  The
    Company plans to fund common stock dividends with available
    cash and cash flow from operations.

      At December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company decreased
    short-term borrowings by $1,778,000, $110,393,000 and
    $46,885,000, respectively.  Even though short-term debt
    outstanding at the end of the year has decreased 17.1% from
    1994, the weighted average of seasonal bank loans outstanding
    during the year increased from $16,358,000 in 1994 to
    $106,963,000 in 1995.  Assuming interest rates do not change
    significantly, it is anticipated that the weighted average of
    short-term debt used during 1996 will increase as compared to
    that used in 1995 due to a greater need for funds for the
    share repurchase program and store expansion.  Although a
    portion of the funds will be met with cash flow from
    operations, proceeds from the AST note due in July 1996 and
    continuing principal payments from the InterTAN notes
    receivable, the Company still anticipates that a portion will
    be met through increased debt borrowings.  The reduction in
    short-term borrowings has been funded primarily by proceeds
    from the sale of divested operations and cash provided by
    operations.  The Company's primary source of short-term debt,
    for which borrowings and repayments have been presented net
    in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consists of
    short-term seasonal bank debt and commercial paper.  The
    commercial paper matures within 90 days as does the short-
    term seasonal bank debt.

      In January 1995, the $45,000,000 of 8.69% senior notes
    which were outstanding at December 31, 1994 were paid in
    full.  These senior notes had been outstanding since February
    7, 1990.  In February 1995, the $6,000,000 of Tandy Credit's
    medium-term notes, which were outstanding at December 31,
    1994 and were to mature in May and August of 1995, were paid
    in full.

    CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
      The Company's balance sheet and financial condition
    continue to be strong.  The Company's available borrowing
    facilities as of December 31, 1995 are detailed in Note 9 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

      In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, the Company issued
    150,000 PERCS shares and used the proceeds of this offering
    to purchase $430,000,000 of the Company's common stock for
    treasury.  The PERCS are discussed further in Note 18 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  On January 23,
    1995, Tandy announced that it had exercised its right to call
    the issued and outstanding PERCS for conversion on March 10,
    1995 prior to the mandatory conversion date of April 15,
    1995.  For each depositary share redeemed, 0.787757 Tandy
    common shares were issued for an aggregate of approximately
    11,816,000 shares.

      On December 18, 1995, the Company announced that its Board
    of Directors authorized management to purchase up to
    5,000,000 shares of its common stock in addition to shares
    required for employee plans.  This authorization to purchase
    additional shares follows the 12,500,000 share repurchase
    program which began in August 1994 and concluded in December
    1995.  Purchases will be made from time to time in the open
    market, and it is expected that funding of the program will
    come from operating cash flow and existing bank facilities.
    As of December 31, 1995, the Company had not repurchased any
    shares under this new program.

      The Company's issue of 10% subordinated debentures due June
    30, 1994 was called by the Company on February 23, 1994 for
    redemption on April 1, 1994.  The redemption was at 100% of
    face value or $32,431,000.

      The revolving credit backup facilities to Tandy's
    commercial paper program were renewed in May 1994.  These
    facilities are to be used only if maturing commercial paper
    cannot be repaid due to an inability to sell new commercial
    paper.  This agreement is composed of two facilities--one for
    $200,000,000 expiring May 1996 and another $200,000,000
    facility expiring in May 1997.  Annual commitment fees for
    the facilities are 2/25 of 1% per annum and 1/8 of 1% per
    annum, respectively, whether used or unused.

      In fiscal 1991, the Company filed a shelf registration for
    $500,000,000, of which $400,000,000 was designated for
    medium-term notes.  During fiscal 1991, short-term debt was
    refinanced by the issuance of $155,500,000 in medium-term
    notes.  Tandy's medium-term notes outstanding at December 31,
    1995 totaled $67,104,000 compared to $73,044,000 and
    $125,479,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
    Availability under the program at December 31, 1995
    approximated $312,800,000.  In February 1995, the $6,000,000
    of Tandy Credit's medium-term notes, which were outstanding
    at December 31, 1994 and were to mature in May and August of
    1995, were paid in full.

      The total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 17.1% at
    December 31, 1995 and 1994 and 22.8% at December 31, 1993.
    This debt-to-capitalization ratio could increase as Tandy
    continues to repurchase shares under the existing
    authorization and fund new store openings and other capital
    expenditures such as updating its POS and other information
    systems.

      The Company also has agreements with unaffiliated groups to
    lease certain stores and these groups are committed to make
    available up to $317,426,000 for development or acquisition
    of stores leased by the Company.  At December 31, 1995, the
    Company had used $208,178,000 of that availability.
    Agreements with these groups mature over the next five years,
    and the Company is continuously monitoring financial markets
    to optimize renewal terms.  In connection with the financing
    of 16 locations by these groups, the Company has guaranteed
    the residual value of the properties at approximately
    $160,671,000 at the end of the lease terms.

      Management believes that the Company's present borrowing
    capacity is greater than the established credit lines and
    long-term debt in place. Management also believes that the
    Company's cash flow from operations, cash and short-term
    investments and its available borrowing facilities are more
    than adequate to fund planned store expansion, to meet debt
    service and dividend requirements and to fund its share
    repurchase program.

    INFLATION
      Inflation has not significantly impacted the Company over
    the past three years.  Management does not expect inflation
    to have a significant impact on operations in the foreseeable
    future unless global situations substantially affect the
    world economy.

    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
      In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (the "FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards ("FAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
    Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
    Of" ("FAS 121"), which is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 1995.  Effective January 1,
    1996, the Company will adopt FAS 121 which requires that
    long-lived assets (i.e. property, plant and equipment and
    goodwill) held and used by an entity be reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be
    recoverable.  An impairment loss will be recognized if the
    sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and
    before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the
    net book value of the asset.  The amount of the impairment
    loss will generally be measured as the difference between the
    net book value of the assets and the estimated fair value of
    the related assets.  Upon adoption in the first quarter of
    fiscal 1996, it is anticipated that the Company may record an
    initial pre-tax impairment loss of approximately $15,000,000
    to $25,000,000 to conform with this statement since it
    requires grouping of assets at the lowest level of cash flows
    to determine impairment.

      In October 1995, the FASB issued FAS No. 123, "Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FAS 123"), which is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995.
    Effective January 1, 1996, the Company will adopt FAS 123
    which establishes financial accounting and reporting
    standards for stock-based employee compensation plans.  The
    pronouncement defines a fair value based method of accounting
    for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument and
    encourages all entities to adopt that method of accounting
    for all of their employee stock option compensation plans.
    However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure
    compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value
    based method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued
    to Employees" ("APB 25").  Entities electing to remain with
    the accounting in APB 25 must make pro forma disclosures of
    net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based
    method of accounting defined in FAS 123 had been applied.
    The Company will continue to account for stock-based employee
    compensation plans under the intrinsic method pursuant to APB
    25 and will make the disclosures in its footnotes as required
    by FAS 123.

    SALE OF JOINT VENTURE INTEREST
      During the quarter ended September 30, 1993, the Company
    entered into definitive agreements with Nokia Corporation
    ("Nokia") to sell the Company's interests in two cellular
    telephone manufacturing joint ventures with Nokia.  Pursuant
    to the terms of the definitive agreements, the Company
    received an aggregate of approximately $31,700,000 for its
    interests in these joint ventures.  The Company also entered
    into a three-year Preferred Supplier Agreement pursuant to
    which it has agreed to purchase from Nokia substantially all
    of RadioShack's requirements for cellular telephones at
    prevailing competitive market prices at the time of the
    purchase.  These operations were not part of the overall
    divestment plan adopted in June 1993 by the Company's Board
    of Directors; therefore, the gain on the sale and their
    results of operations were not included in discontinued
    operations.

    INTERTAN UPDATE
      Summarized in the tables below are the amounts recognized
    by the Company at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and for each of
    the three years ended December 31, 1995, in relation to its
    agreements with InterTAN.  The Company purchased the notes at
    a discount and InterTAN has an obligation to pay the gross
    amount of the notes.

      InterTAN, the former foreign retail operations of Tandy,
    was spun off to Tandy stockholders as a tax-free dividend in
    fiscal 1987.  Under the merchandise purchase terms of the
    original distribution agreement, InterTAN could purchase on
    payment terms products sold or secured by Tandy.  A&A, a
    subsidiary of Tandy, was the exclusive purchasing agent for
    products originating in the Far East for InterTAN.

      On July 16, 1993, InterTAN had an account payable to Tandy
    of approximately $17,000,000, of which $7,600,000 was in
    default.  InterTAN's outstanding purchase orders for
    merchandise placed under the distribution agreement with
    Tandy, but not yet shipped, totaled approximately
    $44,000,000.  Since InterTAN defaulted, on July 16 Tandy
    terminated the merchandise purchase terms of the distribution
    agreement and the license agreements.  Tandy offered InterTAN
    interim license agreements which expired July 22, 1993,
    unless extended.  The agreements were extended on July 23,
    1993.

      On July 30, 1993, Trans World Electronics, Inc. ("Trans
    World"), a subsidiary of Tandy, reached agreement with
    InterTAN's banking syndicate to buy approximately $42,000,000
    of InterTAN's debt at a negotiated, discounted price.  The
    closing of this purchase occurred on August 5, 1993, at which
    time Tandy resumed limited shipments to InterTAN and granted
    a series of short-term, interim licenses pending the
    execution of new license and merchandise agreements.  The
    debt purchased from the banks was restructured into a seven-
    year note with interest of 8.64% due semiannually beginning
    February 25, 1994 and semiannual principal payments beginning
    February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).  Trans World
    provided approximately $10,000,000 in working capital and
    trade credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the working capital
    loan (the "Series B" note) of 8.11% is due semiannually
    beginning February 25, 1994 with the principal due in full on
    August 25, 1996.  Trans World also has received warrants with
    a five-year term exercisable for approximately 1,450,000
    shares of InterTAN common stock at an exercise price of
    $6.618 per share.  As required by an agreement with Tandy,
    InterTAN has registered the warrants under the Securities Act
    of 1933.  At December 31, 1995, InterTAN's common stock
    price, as quoted in the Wall Street Journal, was $7.25 per
                            -------------------
    share.  At February 29, 1996, InterTAN's common stock price
    was $5.00 per share.

      In addition to the bank debt purchased by Trans World and
    the working capital loan, InterTAN's obligations to Trans
    World included two additional notes for approximately
    $23,665,000 (the "Series C" note) and $24,037,000 (the
    "Series D" note) with interest rates of 7.5% and 8%,
    respectively.  All principal and interest on these two notes
    have been paid in full.  Subject to certain conditions
    described below, all of Tandy's debt from InterTAN is secured
    by a first priority lien on substantially all of InterTAN's
    assets in Canada and the U.K.

      A new merchandise agreement was reached with InterTAN in
    October 1993, and amended in 1995, which requires a
    percentage of future purchase orders to be backed by letters
    of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license agreements provide
    a royalty payable to Tandy, which began in the September 1995
    quarter.  InterTAN had obligations for purchase orders
    outstanding for merchandise ordered by A&A for InterTAN but
    not yet shipped totaling approximately $25,447,000 at
    December 31, 1995.

      InterTAN increased its bank revolving credit facility with
    its new banking syndicate to Canadian $60,000,000 (U.S.
    $43,975,000 equivalent at December 31, 1995) in 1994.  In the
    event of InterTAN's default on the bank credit line, Tandy
    will, at the option of InterTAN's new banking syndicate,
    purchase InterTAN's inventory and related accounts receivable
    at 50% of their net book value, up to the amount of
    outstanding bank loans, but not to exceed Canadian
    $60,000,000.  In that event, Tandy could foreclose on its
    first priority lien on InterTAN's assets in Canada and the
    U.K.  If Tandy fails to purchase the inventory and related
    accounts receivable of InterTAN from the banking syndicate,
    the syndicate, upon notice to Tandy and expiration of time,
    can foreclose upon InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K.
    ahead of Tandy.  The inventory repurchase agreement between
    InterTAN's banking syndicate and Tandy has been amended and
    restated to reflect the foregoing.

      A&A will continue as the exclusive purchasing agent for
    InterTAN in the Far East on a commission basis.  Effective
    March 1994, only the purchasing agent commission and sales by
    Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN were recorded as sales
    and operating revenues.  InterTAN purchases from third
    parties through A&A are no longer recorded as sales,
    reflecting the arrangement under the new merchandise
    agreement.  Accordingly, sales by Tandy to InterTAN in 1994
    and 1995 were considerably lower than in prior years;
    however, the earned income relating thereto was not
    materially different.

      Through February 1996, InterTAN has met all of its payment
    obligations to Tandy.  Published income before taxes for the
    six months ended December 31, 1995 approximated $13,151,000
    compared to $15,329,000 for the six months ended December 31,
    1994.  The reduction in InterTAN's earnings per fully diluted
    share from $1.11 in the six months ended December 31, 1994 to
    $0.52 in the current six months is primarily attributable to
    a tax credit taken in fiscal 1995, and to a lesser extent, an
    economic downtrend in its primary market of Canada.  Nothing
    has come to the attention of management which would indicate
    that InterTAN would not be able to continue to meet its
    payment obligations pursuant to the debt agreements with
    Tandy.

      Canadian tax authorities are reviewing InterTAN's Canadian
    subsidiary's 1987-89 tax returns.  The Company cannot
    determine whether the ultimate resolution of that review will
    have an effect on InterTAN's ability to meet its obligations
    to Tandy, but at present, nothing has come to the attention
    of the Company which would lead it to believe that the
    ultimate resolution of this review would impair InterTAN's
    ability to meet its obligations to Tandy.

    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements......    37-56

      Separate financial statements of Tandy Corporation have
    been omitted because Tandy is primarily an operating company
    and the amount of restricted net assets of consolidated and
    unconsolidated subsidiaries and Tandy's equity in
    undistributed earnings of 50% or less-owned companies
    accounted for by the equity method are not significant. All
    subsidiaries of Tandy Corporation are included in the
    consolidated financial statements. Financial statements of
    50% or less-owned companies have been omitted because they do
    not, considered individually or in the aggregate, constitute
    a significant subsidiary.

      The financial statement schedules should be read in
    conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.  All
    other schedules have been omitted because they are not
    applicable, not required or the information is included in
    the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.

                  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

    To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
    Tandy Corporation

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed
    in the accompanying index on page 30 present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of Tandy
    Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December
    31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted
    accounting principles.  These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company's management; our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of
    these statements in accordance with generally accepted
    auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
    audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
    financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
    audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
    above.

    As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    income taxes in 1993.

    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    Tandy Corporation and Subsidiaries

    NOTE 1-DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
      Tandy Corporation ("Tandy" or the "Company") is engaged in
    consumer electronics retailing including the retail sale of
    personal computers.  RadioShack(SM) is the largest of Tandy's
    retail store systems with company-owned stores and
    dealer/franchise outlets.  RadioShack's sales are primarily
    related to private label consumer electronics and brand name
    personal computers.  Tandy also operates the Computer City(R)
    and Incredible Universe(R) store chains.  Computer City sales
    relate to personal computers, printers, peripheral equipment
    and software. Incredible Universe sales relate primarily to
    brand name appliances and consumer electronics including
    personal computers and related software.

      On December 30, 1994, the Company adopted a formal plan to
    close 233 Tandy Name Brand stores, and as a result of the
    closings, the Tandy Name Brand Retail Group ("Tandy Name
    Brand") was dissolved in 1995.  The remaining 73 Tandy Name
    Brand stores have been transferred to the Tandy Specialty
    Retail Group of the RadioShack division.  Additionally, Tandy
    continues to operate certain related retail support groups
    and consumer electronics manufacturing businesses.

    certain foreign operations end one month earlier than the
    Company's year end to facilitate their inclusion in the
    consolidated financial statements.  The manufacturing and
    marketing operations included in the divestment plan have
    been accounted for as discontinued operations.  See Note 21
    for further information relating to discontinued operations.
    Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in
    consolidation.

      FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:  In accordance with the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") Statement
    No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation," balance sheet
    accounts of the Company's foreign operations are translated
    from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at year end or
    historical rates while income and expenses are translated at
    the weighted average sales exchange rates for the year.
    Translation gains or losses related to net assets located
    outside the United States are shown as a separate component
    of stockholders' equity.  Losses aggregating $19,803,000, net
    of tax, relating to discontinued operations were transferred
    from equity and charged to loss on disposal of discontinued
    operations during 1993.  Gains and losses resulting from
    foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a
    currency other than the entity's functional currency) are
    included in net income.  Such foreign currency transaction
    gains approximated $1,097,000, $1,495,000 and $762,000 for
    the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,respectively.

      CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE-PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES:
    In January 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income
    Taxes" ("FAS 109") and applied the provisions prospectively.
    The adoption of FAS 109 changes the Company's method of
    accounting for income taxes from the deferred method ("APB
    11") to an asset and liability approach.  The asset and
    liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax
    liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
    amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.

      The adjustments to the January 1, 1993 balance sheet to
    adopt FAS 109 totaled $13,014,000.  Approximately $9,786,000
    of this adjustment related to continuing operations and the
    remaining $3,228,000 was from discontinued operations.  The
    aggregate amount of $13,014,000 is reflected in the
    accompanying 1993 Consolidated Statements of Income as the
    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.  It
    primarily represents the impact of adjusting deferred taxes
    to reflect the then current tax rate of 34% as opposed to the
    higher tax rates that were in effect when the deferred taxes
    originated.  See Note 12 for further discussion of income
    taxes.

      EXTENDED SERVICE CONTRACTS:  Tandy's retail operations
    offer extended service contracts on products sold.  These
    contracts generally provide extended service coverage for
    periods of 12 to 48 months.  During 1995, the Company sold
    extended service contracts on behalf of an unrelated third
    party and, to a much lesser extent, sold its own extended
    service contracts.  Contracts sold prior to January 1, 1995
    were offered directly by the Company.  The Company accounts
    for sales of its own contracts in accordance with FASB
    Technical Bulletin No. 90-1, "Accounting for Separately
    Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts"
    which requires that revenues from sales of extended service
    contracts be recognized ratably over the lives of the
    contracts.  Costs directly related to sales of such contracts
    are deferred and charged to expense proportionately as the
    revenues are recognized.  A loss is recognized on extended
    service contracts if the sum of the expected costs of
    providing services under the contracts exceeds related
    unearned revenue.  Commission revenue for the unrelated third
    party extended service contracts is recognized at the time of
    sale.

      As described in Note 3, the Company transferred all
    obligations with respect to contracts in force at December
    31, 1994 to an unrelated party, except certain contracts
    aggregating approximately $7,734,000.

      CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS:  Cash on hand in stores,
    deposits in banks and short-term investments with original
    maturities of three months or less are considered cash and
    cash equivalents.  Short-term investments are carried at
    cost, which approximates market value.

      ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS:
        CREDIT OPERATIONS-As described in Note 3, the Company's
    Computer City and Incredible Universe private label credit
    card portfolios were sold in December 1994, and the Company's
    RadioShack and McDuff private label credit card portfolios
    were sold in the first half of 1995.  Subsequent to the sale
    of the portfolios, consumer sales made pursuant to the
    private label credit card programs are being financed by an
    unrelated third party.

      Prior to the sale, the customer receivables of the credit
    operations were classified as current assets, including
    amounts which were contractually due after one year.  This is
    consistent with retail industry practices.

      Finance charges, late charges and returned check fees
    arising from the Company's private label credit cards were
    recognized when earned as interest income.  The Company's
    policy was to write off accounts when they became 180 days
    past due or whenever deemed uncollectible by management,
    whichever was sooner.  Collection efforts continued
    subsequent to write-off.

      The Company was charged a fee by an outside accounts
    receivable processing service for establishing new accounts.
    These initial direct costs were capitalized and amortized on
    a straight-line basis over a period of 84 months, the
    estimated life over which the account would be used by a
    customer.  These costs are shown in the accompanying 1994
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as a part of the related accounts
    receivable.  Amortization of these loan origination costs
    were included as a reduction of interest income in the
    accompanying 1994 and 1993 Consolidated Statements of Income.
    Costs to process accounts on an ongoing basis were expensed
    as incurred.  These initial direct costs were sold along with
    the portfolios.

        OTHER CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES-An allowance for doubtful
    accounts is provided when accounts are determined to be
    uncollectible.

      Concentrations of credit risk with respect to customer
    receivables are limited due to the large number of customers
    comprising the Company's customer base and their location in
    many different geographic areas of the country; however, see
    Note 8 for a discussion of a concentration of credit risk of
    long-term receivables.

      INVENTORIES:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
    (principally based on average cost) or market value and are
    comprised primarily of finished goods.

      PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:  For financial reporting
    purposes, depreciation and amortization are primarily
    calculated using the straight-line method, which amortizes
    the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives.
    The ranges of estimated useful lives are:

    _____________________________________________________________
    Buildings .......................                 10-40 years
    Buildings under capital lease....  over the life of the lease
    Equipment .......................                  2-15 years
    Leasehold improvements...........   primarily, the shorter of
                              the life of the improvements or the
            term of the related lease and certain renewal periods
    _____________________________________________________________


      When depreciable assets are sold or retired, the related
    cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts.  Any gains or losses are included in selling,
    general and administrative expenses.  Major additions and
    betterments are capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs which
    do not materially improve or extend the lives of the
    respective assets are charged to operating expenses as
    incurred.  Amortization of buildings under capital lease is
    included in depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

      AMORTIZATION OF EXCESS PURCHASE PRICE OVER NET TANGIBLE
    ASSETS OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED: The excess purchase price is
    generally amortized over a 40-year period using the straight-
    line method and the net balance is classified as a non-
    current asset.

      FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  The fair value of
    financial instruments is determined by reference to various
    market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate.
    Unless otherwise disclosed, the fair values of financial
    instruments approximate their recorded values due primarily
    to the short-term nature of their maturities.

      HEDGING AND DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY:  The Company enters into
    interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate
    exposure by effectively trading floating interest rates for
    fixed interest rates.  As the Company has used the swaps to
    hedge certain obligations with floating rates, the difference
    between the floating and fixed interest rate amounts, based
    on these swap agreements, is recorded as income or expense.
    Through December 31, 1995, the Company had entered into five
    swaps with regard to notional amounts totaling $90,000,000.
    The swap agreements all expire during the third quarter of
    1999.  Prior to 1995 the Company was not a party to any
    interest rate swaps.  The Board of Directors has authorized
    management to enter into interest rate swaps up to notional
    amounts not exceeding $250,000,000.  At December 31, 1995,
    the Company would have had to pay approximately $7,000,000 to
    terminate the interest rate swaps in place.  This amount was
    obtained from the counterparties and represents the fair
    value of the swap agreements; the amount is not recognized in
    the consolidated financial statements since the swaps are not
    held for trading purposes.  At December 31, 1995, the
    weighted average interest rate of the floating rate
    obligations being hedged was 6.4%, and the weighted average
    interest rate of the fixed rate obligations imposed by the
    swap agreements was 7.7%.  The interest rate swap agreements
    have been entered into with major financial institutions
    which are expected to fully perform under the terms of the
    swap agreements.

      The Company has not historically utilized derivatives to
    manage foreign currency risks and exposure except for an
    immaterial amount of foreign exchange forward contracts used
    to hedge a portion of its foreign purchases.  As of December
    31, 1995, the Company had no outstanding purchase orders for
    which a foreign exchange contract was used as a hedge.  The
    few contracts that were used did not involve leverage and did
    not have other high risk characteristics.  Moody's has
    assigned a counterparty rating to Tandy Corporation of Baa2.
    This rating is an opinion of the financial capacity of Tandy
    to honor its senior obligations under financial contracts.
    Financial contracts entered into by Tandy include the limited
    use of foreign currency forwards to hedge foreign exchange
    risk arising from the purchase of inventory.

      REVENUES:  Retail sales are recorded on the accrual basis.

      STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS:  Direct incremental expenses
    associated with the openings of new Computer City and
    Incredible Universe stores, comprised primarily of payroll
    and payroll-related costs, are deferred and amortized over a
    twelve-month period from the date of the store opening.
    Deferred store pre-opening expenses for Computer City and
    Incredible Universe approximated $6,795,000, $4,538,000 and
    $1,845,000 at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

      NET INCOME PER AVERAGE COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARE:
    Net income per average common and common equivalent share is
    computed by dividing net income less the Series B convertible
    stock dividends (before tax benefit) by the weighted average
    common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
    period. As the Preferred Equity Redemption Convertible Stock
    ("PERCS") mandatorily converted into common stock, they were
    considered outstanding common stock and the dividends have
    not been deducted from net income for purposes of calculating
    net income per average common and common equivalent share.
    On January 23, 1995, the Company announced that the PERCS and
    the underlying depositary shares would be converted on March
    10, 1995.  For each depositary share redeemed, 0.787757 Tandy
    common shares were issued for an aggregate of approximately
    11,816,000 shares.  Current year weighted average share
    calculations include approximately 11,816,000 common shares
    relating to the PERCS.  Per share amounts and the weighted
    average number of shares outstanding for the years ended
    December 31, 1994 and 1993  also reflected the PERCS
    conversion into approximately 11,816,000 common shares.

      Fully diluted earnings available per common and common
    equivalent share are not presented since dilution is less
    than 3%.

      Earnings available per common and common equivalent share
    for each period presented, assuming the PERCS converted to
    common stock under the "if converted" method and only if
    dilutive, would have been presented as in the table which
    follows.

      TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM:  On December 18, 1995,
    the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized
    management to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common
    stock in addition to shares required for employee plans.
    These purchases are in addition to the share repurchase
    program which began in August 1994 and concluded in December
    1995, under which the Company repurchased 12,500,000 shares.
    Purchases will be made from time to time in the open market,
    and it is expected that funding of the program will come from
    operating cash flow and existing bank facilities.  As of
    December 31, 1995, the Company had not repurchased any shares
    under this new program.

      ADVERTISING COSTS:  All advertising costs of the Company
    are expensed the first time the advertising takes place.
    Advertising expense was $257,299,000, $224,212,000 and
    $205,831,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
    1993, respectively.

      NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS: In March 1995, the FASB issued
    FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
    Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" ("FAS
    121"), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 1995.  Effective January 1, 1996, the Company
    will adopt FAS 121 which requires that long-lived assets
    (i.e. property, plant and equipment and goodwill) held and
    used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value
    of the asset may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss will
    be recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows
    (undiscounted and before interest) from the use of the asset
    is less than the net book value of the asset.  The amount of
    the impairment loss will generally be measured as the
    difference between the net book value of the assets and the
    estimated fair value of the related assets.  Upon adoption in
    the first quarter of fiscal 1996, it is anticipated that the
    Company may record an initial pre-tax impairment loss of
    approximately $15,000,000 to $25,000,000 (unaudited) to
    conform with this statement since it requires grouping of
    assets at the lowest level of cash flows to determine
    impairment.

      In October 1995, the FASB issued FAS No. 123, "Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation" ("FAS 123"), which is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995.
    Effective January 1, 1996, the Company will adopt FAS 123
    which establishes financial accounting and reporting
    standards for stock-based employee compensation plans.  The
    pronouncement defines a fair value based method of accounting
    for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument and
    encourages all entities to adopt that method of accounting
    for all of their employee stock option compensation plans.
    However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure
    compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value
    based method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued
    to Employees" ("APB 25").  Entities electing to remain with
    the accounting in APB  25 must make pro forma disclosures of
    net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based
    method of accounting defined in FAS 123 had been applied.
    The Company will continue to account for stock-based employee
    compensation plans under the intrinsic method pursuant to APB
    25 and will make the disclosures in its footnotes as required
    by FAS 123.

      PERVASIVENESS OF ESTIMATES:  The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
    principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, and related revenues and expenses, and
    disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the
    financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

      RECLASSIFICATION:  Certain amounts in prior years have been
    reclassified to conform to classifications adopted in 1995.

    NOTE 3-GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS AND EXTENDED SERVICE
    CONTRACTS
      In December 1994, the Company entered into an agreement
    with SPS Transaction Services, Inc., a majority-owned
    subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover & Company ("SPS") to sell
    its Computer City and Incredible Universe private label
    credit card portfolios without recourse.  As a result of the
    agreement, Tandy received cash of $85,764,000 and received a
    deferred payment of $179,777,000.  The Company recognized a
    gain of $35,708,000 in the accompanying 1994 Consolidated
    Statements of Income.  The deferred payment amount did not
    bear interest.  The total principal amount of $179,777,000
    was paid in full during 1995.  The Company discounted the
    deferred payment by $3,477,000 to yield interest income of
    approximately 5% over the twelve month payout period.

      On March 30, 1995, the Company completed the sale, at net
    book value, of the RadioShack and Tandy Name Brand private
    label credit card accounts and substantially all related
    accounts receivable to Hurley State Bank, a subsidiary of
    SPS.  As a result of the transaction, Tandy received
    $342,822,000 in cash and a deferred payment amount of
    $49,444,000.  The deferred payment does not bear interest,
    and principal is paid monthly with final payment due February
    29, 1996.  The remaining discounted deferred payment balance
    of $2,098,000 is classified as a current receivable in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1995.

      Effective December 1994, the Company transferred all of its
    existing obligations with respect to extended service
    contracts in force at December 31, 1994, with the exception
    of certain contracts aggregating approximately $7,734,000, to
    an unrelated third party.  The unrelated third party
    contractually assumed all of the Company's legal obligations
    and risk of future loss pursuant to the extended service
    contracts in exchange for $75,059,000.  As a result, the
    Company recognized a gain of $55,729,000 associated with this
    transaction in its accompanying 1994 Consolidated Statements
    of Income.  The Company continues to provide repair services
    to customers who tender products pursuant to the extended
    service contracts on a non-exclusive basis.  The unrelated
    third party pays the Company competitive market rates for
    repairs on products tendered pursuant to the extended service
    contracts.

    NOTE 4-RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
      In December 1994, the Company adopted a business
    restructuring plan to close or convert 233 of the 306 Tandy
    Name Brand stores.  At March 31, 1995, all 233 stores had
    been closed or converted.  The remaining stores have become
    part of the Tandy Specialty Retail Group of the RadioShack
    division.  A pre-tax charge of $89,071,000 was taken in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 related to the closing and
    conversion of these stores.  The components of the
    restructuring charge and an analysis of the amounts charged
    against the reserve are outlined in the following table:

    The lease obligation charges for 1995 were net of an
    additional reserve of $1,100,000.  The remaining reserve at
    December 31, 1995 relates to estimated future payments to
    landlords to terminate store lease agreements for which the
    lease term has not yet expired, been subleased or terminated
    pursuant to a settlement agreement.

      Sales and operating revenues associated with the closed
    Tandy Name Brand stores approximated $28,041,000 (unaudited)
    and operating losses approximated $3,064,000 (unaudited) for
    the year ended December 31, 1995.  Sales and operating
    revenues associated with the closed Tandy Name Brand stores
    approximated $261,990,000 (unaudited) and $271,914,000
    (unaudited) for 1994 and 1993, respectively, and operating
    losses approximated  $18,125,000 (unaudited) and $15,342,000
    (unaudited) for 1994 and 1993, respectively.  In conjunction
    with this restructuring, 1,425 (unaudited) employees were
    terminated, most of whom were store employees and managers.

    NOTE 5-SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
      The weighted average interest rates were 4.8% and 5.2% at
    December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, for short-term
    investments totaling $20,797,000 and $80,373,000,
    respectively.

      During 1991 the Company executed an asset securitization
    for its private label credit card portfolio for approximately
    $350,000,000 of which $300,990,000 was remaining at December
    31, 1994.  The Company no longer services, has an interest in
    or any obligation relating to these securitized receivables
    since they were included in the sale of the private label
    credit card portfolio to SPS (see Note 3).

      Interest income related to the Company's credit card
    operations totaled $18,540,000, $46,868,000 and $57,401,000
    for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
    respectively.  During 1995 the Company recorded interest
    income earned, including accretion of discount, on notes
    receivable from AST Research, Inc. ("AST") and InterTAN, Inc.

    respectively.  In 1995 and 1994 the Company recognized
    interest income from the IRS reflecting the settlement of
    outstanding tax issues of approximately $6,183,000 and
    $9,582,000, respectively.  The Company also recorded in 1994
    interest income earned, including accretion of discount, on
    notes receivable from AST and InterTAN approximating

    of discount of $12,161,000.  The balance at December 31, 1994

    AST and InterTAN notes receivable.

    NOTE 9-INDEBTEDNESS AND BORROWING FACILITIES
      Borrowings payable within one year are summarized in the
    accompanying short-term debt table on page 44.  The short-
    term debt caption includes primarily domestic seasonal
    borrowings.  The current portion of long-term debt at
    December 31, 1995 includes $12,904,000 of medium-term notes
    and other loans.  The current portion of long-term debt at
    December 31, 1994 includes $45,000,000 of senior notes and
    $6,208,000 of medium-term notes and other loans.

      Tandy's short-term credit facilities, including revolving
    credit lines, are summarized in the accompanying short-term
    borrowing facilities table found on page 45.  The method used
    to compute averages in the short-term borrowing facilities
    table is based on a daily weighted average computation which
    takes into consideration the time period such debt was
    outstanding as well as the amount outstanding.  The Company's
    primary source of short-term debt, for which borrowings and
    repayments have been presented net in the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows, consists of short-term seasonal
    bank debt and commercial paper.  The commercial paper matures
    within 90 days, as does the short-term seasonal bank debt.

      A commercial paper program was established during fiscal
    1991 for Tandy and was renewed in May 1994. The Company has
    $400,000,000 in committed facilities in place for the
    commercial paper program.  These facilities are to be used
    only if maturing commercial paper cannot be repaid due to an
    inability to sell new paper. This agreement is composed of
    two facilities--one for $200,000,000 expiring in May 1996 and
    another facility for $200,000,000 expiring in May 1997.
    Annual commitment fees for the facilities are 2/25 of 1% per
    annum and 1/8 of 1% per annum, respectively, whether used or
    unused. The commercial paper facilities limit the amount of
    commercial paper that may be outstanding to a maximum of
    $400,000,000.  At December 31, 1995, there were no amounts
    outstanding under the facilities.

      Tandy completed a $500,000,000 shelf registration in
    January 1991 of which $400,000,000 was designated for medium-
    term notes.  At December 31, 1995, available borrowing
    capacity under Tandy's medium-term note programs aggregated
    $312,800,000.  Medium-term notes outstanding at December 31,
    1995 totaled $67,104,000 compared to $73,044,000 at December
    31, 1994.  The weighted average coupon rates of medium-term
    notes outstanding at December 31, 1995 and 1994 were 8.4% and
    8.5%, respectively.  The $6,000,000 of Tandy Credit's medium-
    term notes which were to mature in May and August of 1995
    were paid in full in February 1995.

      The Company established an employee stock ownership trust
    in June 1990. Further information on the trust and its
    related indebtedness, which is guaranteed by the Company, is
    detailed in the discussion of the Tandy Employees Stock
    Ownership Plan in Note 14.

      Long-term borrowings and capital lease obligations
    outstanding at December 31, 1995 mature as follows:

    1995.

    NOTE 10-LEASES AND COMMITMENTS
      Tandy leases rather than owns most of its facilities.  The
    RadioShack stores comprise the largest portion of Tandy's
    leased facilities.  The RadioShack and Computer City stores
    are located primarily in major shopping malls, shopping
    centers or freestanding facilities owned by other companies.
    Store leases are generally based on a minimum rental plus a
    percentage of the store's sales in excess of a stipulated
    base figure.  Tandy also leases distribution centers and
    office space.  In 1995, under sale and leaseback agreements
    with an unrelated third party, the Company sold certain
    Incredible Universe stores for approximately $37,550,000 and
    leased the properties back under a lease agreement which
    matures on September 11, 2000.  No gain was recorded on the
    transactions.  In 1994, the Company sold certain Incredible
    Universe stores for approximately $52,719,000 and leased the
    properties back under a lease agreement which matures on
    September 11, 2000.  The 1994 transactions produced a gain of
    approximately $1,664,000 which was deferred and is being
    amortized over the life of the lease periods.  The Company
    does not have any continuing involvement under the sale-
    leaseback transactions.

      Future minimum rent commitments at December 31, 1995 for
    all long-term noncancelable leases (net of immaterial amounts
    of sublease rent income) are included in the following table.

      The Company also has agreements with unaffiliated groups to
    lease certain stores and these groups are committed to make
    available up to $317,426,000 for development or acquisition
    of stores leased by the Company.  At December 31, 1995, the
    Company had used $208,178,000 of that availability.
    Agreements with these groups mature over the next five years,
    and the Company is continuously monitoring financial markets
    to optimize renewal terms.  In connection with the financing
    of 16 locations by these groups, the Company has guaranteed
    the residual value of the properties at approximately
    $160,671,000 at the end of the lease terms.

      The effective tax rate increased in 1995 due primarily to
    an increase in the effective state tax rate resulting from a
    higher percentage of income being earned in states with
    higher tax rates.

      The IRS Dallas field office is reviewing the Company's
    1987-1989 tax returns and has referred certain issues to the
    IRS National office.  The resolution of this matter, which
    raises questions about the private letter rulings issued by
    the IRS regarding the spin-off of InterTAN and certain other
    tax matters, could result in additional taxes and interest to
    the Company.  Although aggregate additional taxes involved in
    these transactions could potentially range from $0 to $27
    million, based on the advice of the Company's independent tax
    advisors, the Company believes it would prevail if any tax
    litigation were instituted.  Any ultimate tax assessment
    would also include interest expense.  In any event, the
    Company believes the ultimate resolution would have no
    material impact on the Company's financial condition.

      Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1995
    and December 31, 1994  were comprised of the following:

    NOTE 13-STOCK PURCHASE AND SAVINGS PLANS

      TANDY CORPORATION STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM ("SPP").  Eligible
    employees may contribute 1% to 10% (1% to 7% for U.S.
    eligible employees, effective January 1,1996) of annual
    compensation to purchase Company common stock at fair market
    value.  The Company matches 40%, 60% or 80% of the employee's
    contribution depending on the length of the employee's
    participation in the SPP.  Tandy's contributions to the SPP
    were $17,975,000, $16,881,000 and $18,955,000 for the years
    ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

      TANDY EMPLOYEES DEFERRED SALARY AND INVESTMENT PLAN
    ("DIP").  Prior to January 1, 1996, an eligible employee
    electing to participate in the DIP could defer 5% of annual
    compensation, subject to certain limitations established by
    the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  The Company makes contributions
    to the employee stock ownership plan described in Note 14 in
    lieu of matching contributions to the DIP.  An administrative
    committee appointed by the Board of Directors invests the
    DIP's assets primarily in Tandy securities.  Effective
    January 1, 1996, the DIP and TESOP were merged to form a new
    plan called the Tandy Fund.  Under the Tandy Fund,
    participants may contribute from 1% to 8% of annual
    compensation.  Employees participating in the Tandy Fund may
    elect to allocate their deferred salary contributions among a
    group of investment choices.  The Tandy Fund accepts
    rollovers from other qualified 401(k) plans and has a profit
    sharing provision.

    NOTE 14-TANDY EMPLOYEES STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN ("TESOP")
      On July 31, 1990, the TESOP trustee borrowed $100,000,000
    at an interest rate of 9.34% with varying semi-annual
    principal payments through June 30, 2000.  On December 15,
    1994, the TESOP entered into an agreement with an unrelated
    third party to refinance a portion of the TESOP's
    indebtedness by borrowing $5,063,000 at an interest rate of
    8.76% to retire a portion of the original $100,000,000
    indebtedness.  The maturity date of this borrowing is
    December 30, 2000.  On December 28, 1995, the TESOP borrowed
    an additional $4,303,000 from the unrelated third party to
    refinance a portion of the TESOP's indebtedness.  This amount
    was borrowed at an interest rate of 6.47% and matures on
    December 31, 2001.  Dividend payments and contributions from
    Tandy will be used to repay the indebtedness.  Tandy is
    obligated to make semi-annual contributions to the TESOP to
    enable it to pay principal and interest on the securities.
    Because Tandy has guaranteed the repayment of these notes,
    the indebtedness of the TESOP is recognized as a long-term
    obligation in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    An offsetting charge has been made in the stockholders'
    equity section of the accompanying Consolidated Balance
    Sheets to reflect unearned compensation related to the TESOP.

      The TESOP trustee used the proceeds from the issuance of
    the 1990 notes to purchase 100,000 shares of Series B TESOP
    Convertible Preferred Stock (the "TESOP Preferred Stock")
    from Tandy at a price of $1,000 per share.  Each share of
    such stock is convertible into 21.768 shares of Tandy common
    stock.  The annual cumulative dividend on TESOP Preferred
    Stock is $75.00 per share, payable semi-annually.  This
    series of stock has certain liquidation preferences and may
    be redeemed by Tandy after July 1, 1994 at specified
    premiums.

      During the term of the TESOP, the TESOP Preferred Stock
    will be allocated to the participants annually based on the
    total debt service made on the indebtedness.  As vested
    participants withdraw from the TESOP, payments are made in
    cash or Tandy common stock. The preferred stock has a face
    value of $1,000 per share and the Company is obligated to
    redeem the preferred stock at the higher of the appraised
    value or $1,000 per share in the event of a participant's
    withdrawal.  The Company has the option to redeem the
    preferred stock in either cash or common stock.

      As shares of the TESOP Preferred Stock are allocated to the
    TESOP participants, compensation expense is recorded and
    unearned compensation is reduced.  Interest expense on the
    TESOP notes is also recognized as a cost of the TESOP.  The
    compensation component of the TESOP expense is reduced by the
    amount of dividends accrued on the TESOP Preferred Stock with
    any dividends in excess of the compensation expense reflected
    as a reduction of interest expense.  During the year ended
    December 31, 1995, the compensation and interest costs
    related to the TESOP before the reduction for the allocation
    of dividends were $7,480,000 and $5,719,000, respectively.
    During the year ended December 31, 1994, the compensation and
    interest costs related to the TESOP before the reduction for
    the allocation of dividends were $10,008,000 and $6,202,000,
    respectively.  The compensation and interest costs related to
    the TESOP before the reduction for the allocation of
    dividends were $9,605,000 and $7,195,000, respectively,
    during the year ended December 31, 1993.  Contributions from
    Tandy to the TESOP for the years ended December 31, 1995,
    1994 and 1993 totaled $11,216,000, $11,189,000 and
    $17,895,000, respectively, including the $6,537,000,
    $6,777,000 and $7,135,000 of dividends paid on the TESOP
    Preferred Stock.

      At December 31, 1995, 39,162 shares of TESOP Preferred
    Stock had been released and allocated to participants'
    accounts in the TESOP (including 13,619 shares which had been
    withdrawn by participants).  At December 31, 1995, 8,071
    shares of TESOP Preferred Stock were released for allocation
    to participants on the March 31, 1996 annual allocation date.
    At December 31, 1995, 52,767 shares of TESOP Preferred Stock
    were available for later release and allocation to
    participants over the remaining life of the TESOP.

      The TESOP fiscal year ends on March 31.  At March 31, 1995,
    the TESOP held as assets $95,946,000 of TESOP Preferred Stock
    and $3,937,000 of receivables and had liabilities comprised
    of the remaining principal on the notes of $63,993,000 and
    accrued interest payable on the notes of $1,487,000,
    resulting in net assets of $34,403,000.

    NOTE 15-STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS
      1985 Stock Option Plan ("SOP")
      ------------------------------
      Under the 1985 SOP, as amended, options to acquire up to
    2,000,000 fully registered shares of Tandy's common stock may
    be granted to officers and key management employees of the
    Company.  The Organization and Compensation Committee (the
    "Committee") has sole discretion in determining whether to
    grant options, who shall receive them, the number of options
    granted to any individual and whether an option will be an
    incentive stock option or a nonstatutory stock option.  The
    term of incentive stock options may not exceed 10 years and
    the term of nonstatutory stock options may not exceed a term
    of 10 years plus one month.

      The maximum amount that may be exercised at the expiration
    of each of the first through fifth anniversaries of the
    nonstatutory stock options is 20%.  On each of the first
    three anniversaries of the date of grant of the incentive
    stock options, one-third of each individual's options become
    exercisable.  In the event of a change in control, all
    outstanding options become immediately exercisable for the
    full number of shares subject to options.  The option price
    is determined by the Committee at the time the option is
    granted, but the option price will not be less than 100% of
    the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant.
    Since the option prices have been fixed at the market price
    on the date of grant, no compensation has been charged
    against earnings by the Company.  Authorized and unissued
    shares or treasury stock may be issued to participants when
    options are exercised.

      Under the SOP there were 978,204 vested options which could
    have been exercised for a total price of $33,644,772 at
    December 31, 1995.  Shares available for additional grants
    under the SOP were 242,626 at December 31, 1995.

      1993 Incentive Stock Plan ("ISP")
      ---------------------------------
      During March 1993, the Board adopted the ISP, as amended.
    The ISP is administered by the Committee.  A total of
    3,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock were reserved
    for issuance under the ISP and have been registered with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission.  In May 1995, the ISP was
    amended to provide for an initial option grant of 5,000
    shares to each non-employee director, to increase the annual
    September option grant from 3,000 to 4,000 shares and to
    provide for payment of director retainer fees all or one-half
    in Company common stock.

      The ISP permits the grant of incentive stock options
    ("ISOs"), nonstatutory stock options (options which are not
    ISOs) ("NSOs"), stock appreciation rights ("SARs"),
    restricted stock, performance units or performance shares.

      Grants of options under the ISP shall be for terms
    specified by the Committee, except that the term generally
    shall not exceed 10 years.  Provisions of the ISP generally
    provide that in the event of a change in control all options
    become immediately and fully exercisable and all restrictions
    on restricted stock lapse.

      As part of the ISP, as amended in May 1995, each non-
    employee director of the Company receives a grant of NSOs for
    4,000 shares of the Company's common stock on the first
    business day of September of each year ("Director Options").
    Director Options have an exercise price of 100% of the fair
    market value of the Company's common stock on the trading day
    prior to the date of grant, vest as to one-third of the
    shares annually on the first three anniversary dates of the
    date of grant and expire 10 years after the date of grant.
    The first grant of the Director Options was made on September
    1, 1993.

      The exercise price of an option (other than a Director
    Option) is determined by the Committee, provided that the
    exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market
    value of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of
    grant.

      On January 2, 1996, the Committee awarded a total of 26,500
    shares of restricted stock to the five highly compensated
    executive officers named in the proxy statement.  At December
    31, 1995 there were  274,788 vested options which could have
    been exercised for a total exercise price of $10,807,673 and
    1,741,226 shares available for additional grants under the
    ISP.  The ISP shall terminate on the tenth anniversary of the
    day preceding the date of its adoption by the Board and no
    option or award shall be granted under the ISP thereafter.

      Stock option activity from December 31, 1992 through
    December 31, 1995 is summarized in the accompanying chart.

    NOTE 16-PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
      In August 1986, the Board of Directors adopted a
    stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one right
    for each outstanding share of Tandy common stock.  The
    rights, as amended, which will expire on June 22, 2000, are
    currently represented by the common stock certificates and
    when they become exercisable will entitle holders to purchase
    one one-thousandth of a share of Tandy Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock for an exercise price of $140
    (subject to adjustment).  The rights will become exercisable
    and will trade separately from the common stock only upon the
    date of public announcement that a person, entity or group
    ("Person") has acquired 15% or more of Tandy's outstanding
    common stock without the prior consent or approval of the
    disinterested directors ("Acquiring Person") or ten days
    after the commencement or public announcement of a tender or
    exchange offer which would result in any person becoming an
    Acquiring Person.  In the event that any person becomes an
    Acquiring Person, the rights will be exercisable for 60 days
    thereafter for Tandy common stock with a prior market value
    (as determined under the rights plan) equal to twice the
    exercise price.  In the event that, after any person becomes
    an Acquiring Person, the Company engages in certain mergers,
    consolidations, or sales of assets representing 50% or more
    of its assets or earning power with an Acquiring Person (or
    persons acting on behalf of or in concert with an Acquiring
    Person) or in which all holders of common stock are not
    treated alike, the rights will be exercisable for common
    stock of the acquiring or surviving company with a prior
    market value (as determined under the rights plan) equal to
    twice the exercise price.  The rights will not be exercisable
    by any Acquiring Person.  The rights are redeemable at a
    price of $.05 per right prior to any person becoming an
    Acquiring Person or, under certain circumstances, after the
    expiration of the 60-day period described above, but the
    rights may not be redeemed or the rights plan amended for 180
    days following a change in a majority of the members of the
    Board (or if certain agreements are entered into during such
    180-day period).

    NOTE 17-TERMINATION PROTECTION PLANS
      In August 1990, the Board of Directors of the Company
    approved termination protection plans and amendments to
    various other benefit plans described in Note 13.  These
    plans provide for defined termination benefits to be paid to
    eligible employees of the Company who have been terminated,
    without cause, following a change in control of the Company
    (as defined).  In addition, for a certain period of time
    following employee termination, the Company, at its expense,
    must continue to provide on behalf of the terminated employee
    certain employment benefits.  In general, during the twelve
    months following a change in control, the Company may not
    terminate or change existing employee benefit plans in any
    way which will affect accrued benefits or decrease the rate
    of the Company's contribution to the plans.

    NOTE 18-ISSUANCE OF SERIES C PERCS AND TENDER OFFER
      In February 1992, the Company issued 15,000,000 depositary
    shares of Series C Conversion Preferred Stock ("Series C
    PERCS") at $29.50 per depositary share (equivalent to
    $2,950.00 for each Series C PERCS).  Each of the depositary
    shares represented ownership of 1/100th of a share of Series
    C PERCS.  The annual dividend for each depositary share was
    $2.14 (based on the annual dividend rate for each Series C
    PERCS of $214.00).

      Tandy announced on January 23, 1995 that it had exercised
    its right to call all the issued and outstanding Series C
    PERCS for conversion on March 10, 1995, prior to its
    mandatory conversion date of April 15, 1995.  For each Series
    C PERCS depositary share redeemed, 0.787757 Tandy common
    shares were issued for an aggregate of approximately
    11,816,000 shares.  In addition, each Series C PERCS

    NOTE 20-LITIGATION
      The Company is a defendant in a consolidated action titled
    O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc. Securities Litigation,
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    which was commenced in  1994 and is currently pending before
    the United States District Court for the Western District of
    Missouri.  The plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified
    amount alleging that the initial public offering of
    O'Sullivan, which was formerly a subsidiary of the Company,
    as well as certain press releases and other materials,
    contained material misrepresentations and omissions.  The
    parties have recently entered into a Memorandum of
    Understanding which anticipates the settlement of this
    litigation in the near future.  The complete resolution of
    the matter is dependent upon the satisfaction of several
    conditions including the parties entering a binding agreement
    and the Court approving the terms of such an agreement. 
    There can be no assurance that such an agreement will be
    reached or that Court approval will be obtained.  Under the
    terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the Company's
    contributions to the proposed settlement will not have a
    material adverse affect on its results of operations or
    financial condition.  Tandy believes that the lawsuit is
    totally without merit and in the event this matter is not
    resolved, as is presently anticipated, the Company intends to
    resume its vigorous defense of this lawsuit.

      Tandy has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third
    parties, investigations and pending actions involving
    allegations of negligence, product defects, discrimination,
    infringement of intellectual property rights, securities
    matters, tax deficiencies, violations of permits or licenses,
    and breach of contract and other matters against the Company
    and its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its
    business.  The liability, if any, associated with these
    matters was not determinable at December 31, 1995.  While
    certain of these matters involve substantial amounts, and
    although occasional adverse settlements or resolutions may
    occur and negatively impact earnings in the year of
    settlement, it is the opinion of management that their
    ultimate resolution will not have a materially adverse effect
    on Tandy's financial position.

    NOTE 21-DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
      On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy adopted a
    formal plan of divestiture under which the Company would sell
    its computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the
    O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ("O'Sullivan") ready-to-assemble
    furniture manufacturing and related marketing business, the
    Memtek Products division and the Lika printed circuit board
    business.

          Computer Manufacturing. The Company closed the sale
        of the computer manufacturing and marketing
        businesses to AST on July 13, 1993.  In accordance
        with the terms of the definitive agreement between
        Tandy and AST, Tandy received $15,000,000 upon
        closing of the sale.  The balance of the purchase
        price of $96,720,000 was payable by a promissory
        note.  The Company has discounted this note by
        $2,000,000 and the discount continues to be
        recognized as interest income using the effective
        interest rate method over the life of the note.

          During the quarter ended September 30, 1995, the
        Company received $6,720,000 from AST as a prepayment
        on its promissory note.  The original promissory note
        was supported by a standby letter of credit in the
        amount of the lesser of $100,000,000 or 70% of the
        outstanding principal amount of the promissory note.
        This letter of credit has been replaced by a
        $75,000,000 Letter of Guarantee dated August 22,
        1995, from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a Korean
        corporation, or, alternatively, Samsung Electronics
        America, Inc., a New York corporation.  As of
        December 31, 1995, Samsung owned approximately 40% of
        AST's outstanding stock.  Samsung's current credit
        ratings by S&P and Moody's are A- and Baa1,
        respectively.

          As a result of the prepayment, the note has been
        amended and the principal amount reduced to
        $90,000,000.  The terms of the original promissory
        note stipulated that the outstanding principal
        balance could be paid on July 11, 1996 at AST's
        option in cash or the common stock of AST, provided
        that not more than 50% of the original principal
        amount of the note could be paid in common stock of
        AST.  The amended promissory note provides that AST
        may repay the note in AST common stock, provided that
        not more than the lesser of (a) $30,000,000, or (b)
        33% of the outstanding principal amount of the note
        at the time of payment may be payable by AST in
        common stock of AST.  The interest rate on the
        promissory note is currently 5% per annum and is
        adjusted annually, not to exceed 5% per annum.
        Interest is accrued and paid annually.  The fair
        market value of the note approximates $89,754,000 at
        December 31, 1995.

          Memtek Products.  On November 10, 1993, the Company
        executed a definitive agreement with Hanny Magnetics
        (B.V.I.) Limited, a British Virgin Islands
        corporation ("Hanny"), to sell certain assets of the
        Company's Memtek Products operations, including the
        license agreement with Memorex Telex, N.V. for the
        use of the Memorex trademark on licensed consumer
        electronics products.  This sale closed on
        December 16, 1993.  Proceeds from this sale
        aggregated $69,602,000.

          O'Sullivan Industries.  On January 27, 1994 the
        Company announced that it had reached an agreement
        with the underwriters to sell all the common stock of
        O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc., the parent
        company of O'Sullivan, to the public at $22 per
        share.  The net proceeds realized by Tandy in the
        initial public offering, together with a $40,000,000
        cash dividend from O'Sullivan Industries, Inc.,
        approximated $350,000,000.  The initial public
        offering closed on February 2, 1994.

          Tandy has recognized income of approximately
        $1,335,000 and $4,399,000, net of tax, during the
        years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively,
        pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit
        Reimbursement Agreement (the "Agreement") between
        Tandy and O'Sullivan.  Under the Agreement Tandy
        receives payments from O'Sullivan approximating the
        federal tax benefit that O'Sullivan  realizes from
        the increased tax basis of its assets resulting from
        the initial public offering.  The higher tax basis
        increases O'Sullivan's tax deductions and,
        accordingly, reduces income taxes payable by
        O'Sullivan.  These payments will be made over a 15-
        year time period and are contingent upon O'Sullivan's
        taxable income each year.  The Company is recognizing
        these payments as additional sale proceeds and gain
        in the year in which the payments become due and
        payable to the Company pursuant to the Agreement.
        The additional gain is recorded as a reduction of
        SG&A expense in the accompanying Consolidated
        Statements of Income.

          Lika.  On October 11, 1994, Tandy sold the assets
        used in its Lika(R) printed circuit board division to
        Viktron Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited
        partnership.  The proceeds from the sale and
        liquidation of assets approximated $16,380,000 which
        included $7,754,000 in cash, proceeds from
        liquidation of retained assets of $5,594,000 and
        secured promissory notes for $3,032,000.  At December
        31, 1995, $1,400,000 remained as a receivable from
        Viktron.

     The losses from discontinued operations prior to the
    measurement date are outlined in the table below.

      InterTAN, the former foreign retail operations of Tandy,
    was spun off to Tandy stockholders as a tax-free dividend in
    fiscal 1987.  Under the merchandise purchase terms of the
    original distribution agreement, InterTAN could purchase on
    payment terms products sold or secured by Tandy.  A&A
    International ("A&A"), a subsidiary of Tandy, was the
    exclusive purchasing agent for products originating in the
    Far East for InterTAN.

      On July 16, 1993, InterTAN had an account payable to Tandy
    of approximately $17,000,000 of which $7,600,000 was in
    default.  InterTAN's outstanding purchase orders for
    merchandise placed under the distribution agreement with
    Tandy, but not yet shipped, totaled approximately
    $44,000,000.  Because InterTAN had defaulted, on July 16
    Tandy terminated the merchandise purchase terms of the
    distribution agreement and the license agreements.  Tandy
    offered InterTAN interim license agreements which expired
    July 22, 1993, unless extended.  The agreements were extended
    on July 23, 1993.

      On July 30, 1993, Trans World Electronics, Inc. ("Trans
    World"), a subsidiary of Tandy, reached agreement with
    InterTAN's banking syndicate to buy approximately $42,000,000
    of InterTAN's debt at a negotiated, discounted price.  The
    closing of this purchase occurred on August 5, 1993, at which
    time Tandy resumed limited shipments to InterTAN and granted
    a series of short-term, interim licenses pending the
    execution of new license and merchandise agreements.  The
    debt purchased from the banks was restructured into a seven-
    year note with interest of 8.64% due semiannually beginning
    February 25, 1994 and semiannual principal payments beginning
    February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).  Trans World
    provided approximately $10,000,000 in working capital and
    trade credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the working capital
    loan (the "Series B" note) of 8.11% is due semiannually
    beginning February 25, 1994 with the principal due in full on
    August 25, 1996.  Trans World also has received warrants with
    a five-year term exercisable for approximately 1,450,000
    shares of InterTAN common stock at an exercise price of
    $6.618 per share.  As required by an agreement with Tandy,
    InterTAN has registered the warrants under the Securities Act
    of 1933.  At December 31, 1995, InterTAN's common stock
    price, as quoted in the Wall Street Journal, was $7.25 per
                            -------------------
    share.  The fair market value of these warrants at December
    31, 1995 approximates $1,000,000.  At February 29, 1996,
    InterTAN's common stock price had declined to $5.00 and,
    therefore, the fair market value of the warrants declined as
    well.

      In addition to the bank debt purchased by Trans World and
    the working capital loan, InterTAN's obligations to Trans
    World included two additional notes for approximately
    $23,665,000 (the "Series C" note) and $24,037,000 (the
    "Series D" note) with interest rates of 7.5% and 8%,
    respectively.  All principal and interest on these two notes
    have been paid in full.  Subject to certain conditions
    described below, all of Tandy's debt from InterTAN is secured
    by a first priority lien on substantially all of InterTAN's
    assets in Canada and the U.K.

      A new merchandise agreement was reached with InterTAN in
    October 1993, and amended in 1995, which requires a
    percentage of future purchase orders to be backed by letters
    of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license agreements provide
    a royalty payable to Tandy, which began in the September 1995
    quarter.  InterTAN had obligations for purchase orders
    outstanding for merchandise ordered by A&A for InterTAN but
    not yet shipped totaling approximately $25,447,000 at
    December 31, 1995.

      InterTAN increased its bank revolving credit facility with
    its new banking syndicate to Canadian $60,000,000 (U.S.
    $43,975,000 equivalent at December 31, 1995) in 1994.  In the
    event of InterTAN's default on the bank credit line, Tandy
    will, at the option of InterTAN's new banking syndicate,
    purchase InterTAN's inventory and related accounts receivable
    at 50% of their net book value, up to the amount of
    outstanding bank loans, but not to exceed Canadian
    $60,000,000.  In that event, Tandy could foreclose on its
    first priority lien on InterTAN's assets in Canada and the
    U.K.  If Tandy fails to purchase the inventory and related
    accounts receivable of InterTAN from the banking syndicate,
    the syndicate, upon notice to Tandy and expiration of time,
    can foreclose upon InterTAN's assets in Canada and the U.K.
    ahead of Tandy.  The inventory repurchase agreement between
    InterTAN's banking syndicate and Tandy has been amended and
    restated to reflect the foregoing.

      A&A will continue as the exclusive purchasing agent for
    InterTAN in the Far East on a commission basis.  Effective
    March 1994, only the purchasing agent commission and sales by
    Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN were recorded as sales
    and operating revenues.  InterTAN purchases from third
    parties through A&A are no longer recorded as sales,
    reflecting the arrangement under the new merchandise
    agreement.  Accordingly, sales by Tandy to InterTAN in 1995
    and 1994 were considerably lower than in prior years;
    however, the earned income relating thereto was not
    materially different.

      Through February 1996, InterTAN has met all of its payment
    obligations to Tandy.  Published income before taxes for the
    six months ended December 31, 1995 approximated $13,151,000
    compared to $15,329,000 for the six months ended December 31,
    1994.  The reduction in InterTAN's earnings per fully diluted
    share from $1.11 in the six months ended December 31, 1994 to
    $0.52 in the current six months is primarily attributable to
    a tax credit taken in fiscal 1995, and to a lesser extent, an
    economic downtrend in its primary market of Canada.  Nothing
    has come to the attention of management which would indicate
    that InterTAN would not be able to continue to meet its
    payment obligations pursuant to the debt agreements with
    Tandy.

      Canadian tax authorities are reviewing InterTAN's Canadian
    subsidiary's 1987-89 tax returns.  The Company cannot
    determine whether the ultimate resolution of that review will
    have an effect on InterTAN's ability to meet its obligations
    to Tandy, but at present, nothing has come to the attention
    of the Company which would lead it to believe that the
    ultimate resolution of this review would impair InterTAN's
    ability to meet its obligations to Tandy.

    NOTE 23-QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)
      As the Company's operations are predominantly retail
    oriented, its business is subject to seasonal fluctuations
    with the December 31 quarter being the most significant in
    terms of sales and profits because of the Christmas selling
    season.

      During the quarter ended December 31, 1994, the Company
    recognized a restructuring charge of $89,071,000 for business
    restructuring relating to the closing of certain retail
    stores.  The Company also recognized a gain of $91,437,000
    relating to the sale of Computer City and Incredible Universe
    private label credit card portfolios and the transfer of the
    Company's legal obligations pursuant to extended service
    contracts.  See Notes 3 and 4 for further information.

                     ----------------------------------
    interest of each stockholder of the Corporation shall be
    evidenced by a certificate or certificates for shares of
    stock in such form as may be prescribed from time to time by

    Assistant Secretary upon such certificate may be facsimiles

    shall have ceased to be such, whether because of death,
    resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or
    certificates shall have been issued and delivered, such
    certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and
    delivered with the same effect as if such officer or officers
    had not ceased to be such at the date of its issue and
    delivery.

         SECTION 2.  Transfer of Shares.  The shares of the stock
                     ------------------

    with an assignment and power of transfer endorsed thereon or
    attached thereto, duly executed, with such proof or guaranty
    of the authenticity of the signature as the Corporation or
    its agents may reasonably require.  The Corporation shall be
    entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares
    of stock as the holder in fact thereof and accordingly shall
    not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or
    interest in such share or shares on the part of any other
    person whether or not it shall have express or other notice
    thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided by law.

         SECTION 3.  Closing of Transfer Books and Record Dates.
                     ------------------------------------------
    The Board of Directors may in its discretion prescribe in
    advance a period not exceeding fifty (50) days prior to the
    date of any meeting of the stockholders or prior to the last
    day on which the consent or dissent of stockholders may be
    effectively expressed for any purpose without a meeting,
    during which no transfer of stock on the books of the
    Corporation may be made; or in lieu of prohibiting the
    transfer of stock, may fix in advance a time not more than
    fifty (50) days prior to the date of any meeting of
    stockholders or prior to the last day on which the consent or
    dissent of stockholders may be effectively expressed for any
    purpose without a meeting, as the time as of which
    stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such a
    meeting or whose consent or dissent is required or may be
    expressed for any purpose, as the case may be, shall be
    determined; and all persons who were holders of record of
    voting stock at such time and no others shall be entitled to
    notice of and to vote at such meeting or to express their
    consent or dissent, as the case may be, notwithstanding any
    transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after
    any record date fixed as aforesaid.  The Board of Directors
    may also, in its discretion, fix in advance a date not
    exceeding fifty (50) days preceding the date fixed for the
    payment of any dividend or the making of any distribution, or
    for the delivery of evidence of rights, or evidences of
    interests arising out of any issuance, change, conversion or
    exchange of capital stock, as a record date for the
    determination of the stockholders entitled to
    receive or participate in any such dividend, distribution,
    rights or interests, notwithstanding any transfer of any
    stock on the books of the Corporation after any record date
    fixed as aforesaid, or, at its option, in lieu of so fixing a
    record date, may prescribe in advance a period not exceeding
    fifty (50) days prior to the date for such payment,
    distribution or delivery during which no transfer of stock on
    the books of the Corporation may be made.

         SECTION 4.  Lost or Destroyed Certificates.  In case of
                     ------------------------------
    the loss or destruction of any outstanding certificate of
    stock, a new certificate may be issued upon the following
    conditions:

         The owner of said certificate shall file with the
    Secretary of the Corporation an affidavit giving the facts in
    relation to the ownership, and in relation to the loss or
    destruction of said certificate, stating its number and the
    number of shares represented thereby; such affidavit to be in
    such form and contain such statements as shall satisfy the
    Chairman of the Board and Secretary that said certificate has
    been accidentally destroyed or lost, and that a new
    certificate ought to be issued in lieu thereof.  Upon being
    so satisfied, the Chairman of the Board and Secretary shall
    require such owner to file with the Secretary a bond in such
    penal sum and in such form as they may deem advisable, and
    with a surety or sureties approved by them, to indemnify and
    save harmless the Corporation from any claim, loss, damage or
    liability which may be occasioned by the issuance of a new
    certificate in lieu thereof, or if they deem it appropriate,
    to waive the requirement to secure a bond with a surety.
    Upon such bond being so filed, a new certificate for the same
    number of shares shall be issued to the owner of the
    certificate so lost or destroyed; and the transfer agent and
    registrar of stock, if any, shall countersign and register
    such new certificate upon receipt of a written order signed
    by the said Chairman of the Board and Secretary, and
    thereupon the Corporation will save harmless said transfer
    agent and registrar in the premises.  The CEO or the
    President or any Vice President may act hereunder in the
    stead of the Chairman of the Board, and an Assistant
    Secretary in the stead of the Secretary.  In case of the
    surrender of the original certificate, in lieu of which a new
    certificate has been issued, or the surrender of such new
    certificate, for cancellation, the bond of indemnity given as
    a condition of the issue of such new certificate may be
    surrendered.  A new certificate may be issued without
    requiring any bond when in the judgment of the Board of
    Directors it is proper to do so.

         contract, but a method of calculating your
         total earnings.  You forfeit your rights to

         of the current fiscal year.  If you are
         terminated by the Company, you forfeit your
         rights to receive a bonus except at the sole

         fiscal year, your bonus for the current year-

          A.    APPOINTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE:  The
    Tandy Board of Directors shall appoint a committee to be
    known as the "Administrative Committee", hereinafter referred
    to as the "Committee", to administer the Program.  This
    Committee shall consist of three or more members who shall
    not necessarily be employees of Tandy. Tandy shall advise
    the Trustee of the names of the members of the Committee, and
    the Trustee shall be entitled to rely thereon until similarly
    advised of a change in the membership of the Committee.

          B.   TERM OF OFFICE OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS:  Each member
    of  the  Committee shall hold office until his death,
    disability, resignation or removal from office.  Any member
    of the Committee may be removed by the Tandy Board of
    Directors at its pleasure. Any Committee member may resign
    by delivering his written resignation to Tandy and to the
    Committee. Vacancies in the Committee arising from any cause
    whatsoever shall be filled by the Tandy Board of Directors.

         C.   POWERS AND DUTIES:  The Committee shall administer
    the Program in accordance with its terms and shall have all
    powers necessary to carry out the provisions of the Program.
    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
    Committee shall have the following powers:

              (1)  To make and publish such rules and regulations
    as  it may deem necessary to carry out the provisions of the
    Program;

               (2)  To determine all questions arising in the
    administration,  interpretation and application of the
    Program, including questions of eligibility of employees and
    the status and rights of Participants, Beneficiaries and any
    other person hereunder;

               (3)  To deliver funds or purchase Tandy Stock for
    delivery  to  the  Trustee, as more particularly specified
    hereinafter;

               (4)  To authorize all disbursements by the Trustee
    from the Trust Fund;

               (5)  To direct the Trustee to sell Tandy Stock to
    Tandy or on the open market for the purpose of funding
    Financial Hardship withdrawals under the Program;

               (6)  To decide any dispute arising hereunder;

               (7)  To construe the provisions of the Program and

               The determination of the Committee as to any
    questions  arising hereunder shall be conclusive and binding
    on all persons.

          D.   ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF THE COMMITTEE:  The
    Committee shall act by a majority of its members at the time
    in office, and such action may be taken either by a vote at a
    meeting or in writing without a meeting; however, a Committee
    member shall not vote on any question relating specifically
    to himself, but any necessary action regarding such Committee
    member shall be decided by the remaining members of the
    Committee.  In the event the remaining members of the
    Committee are unable to agree upon the disposition of any
    question, the Tandy Board of Directors shall appoint another
    person eligible for membership on the Committee to serve as a
    temporary member for the purpose of reaching a decision on
    the matter in issue. Such matters shall then be determined
    by a majority of the Committee, including said temporary
    member.

          The Committee may authorize any one or more of its
    members to execute any document or documents on behalf of the
    Committee, in which event the Committee shall notify the
    Trustee in writing of such action and the name and names of
    its members so designated. The Trustee thereafter shall
    accept and rely upon any document executed by such member or
    members as representing action by the Committee until the
    Committee shall file with the Trustee a written revocation of
    such designation.

          The Committee may adopt such bylaws and regulations as
    it deems desirable for the conduct of its affairs, and may
    appoint such accountants, counsel, specialists, and other
    persons as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with
    the administration of the Program.  Such accountants and
    counsel may, but need not be accountants and counsel for
    Tandy.  The Committee shall be entitled to rely conclusively
    upon, and shall be fully protected in any action taken by it
    in good faith in relying upon any opinions or reports which
    shall be furnished to it by any such accountant, counsel, or
    other specialist.

          The Committee and the Trustee may by agreement in
    writing arrange for the Committee and/or Tandy to perform any
    of the Trustee's ministerial functions, including but not
    limited to the maintenance of records of accounts of each
    Participant, preparation and distribution of Internal Revenue
    Service, Securities and Exchange Act, or Labor Department
    forms  or documents required to be provided  to  each
    Participant, and delivery of Tandy Stock or cash to the
    Trustee.

          Tandy may furnish the Committee with such clerical
    assistance on a full or part time basis as shall from time to
    time  be  reasonable or desirable to assist in the
    administration of the Program, and shall pay all costs and
    expenses, including Trustee's fees and expenses, incurred in
    the administration of the Program, save and except those
    specified in Section III E; and save and except those costs
    and expenses, including attorneys' fees, which are charged to
    the accounts of Participant's by a court of competent
    jurisdiction in any litigation in which the Program or any of
    its fiduciaries are a party.

          E.   RECORDS AND REPORTS:  The Committee shall keep a
    record of all its proceedings and acts, and shall keep all
    such books of account, records, and other data as may be
    necessary for the proper administration of the Program.  The
    Committee shall notify the Trustee and the Tandy Board of
    Directors of any action taken by the Committee, and, when
    required, shall notify any other interested person  or
    persons.  The Committee will specifically maintain separate
    records as to each Participant's account. Within a reasonable
    period of time after the end of each calendar quarter the
    Committee shall notify each Participant of the total number
    of shares credited to his account which will include the
    employee's contributions, other contributions and Company
    contributions and the cost basis of said shares.

          F.    IMMUNITY  FROM  LIABILITY:   No member of the
    Committee shall incur any liability for any action or failure
    to act, excepting liability for his own gross negligence or
    willful misconduct. Tandy shall indemnify each member of the
    Committee against any and all claims, losses, damages,
    expenses and liabilities, including any amounts paid in
    settlement with the Committee's approval, arising from any
    action or failure to act, except when the same is judicially
    determined to be due to the gross negligence or willful
    misconduct of such member.  The Committee may, at its
    discretion, require the written approval or disapproval of
    Tandy prior to taking action in any particular matter made
    the subject of its responsibility hereunder.

           G.     CONCLUSIVENESS OF DETERMINATION OF  COMPANY
    CONTRIBUTIONS:  Neither the Trustee, Tandy nor the Committee
    shall be under any duty to inquire into the correctness of
    the amounts contributed and paid over to Tandy by a Company
    in accordance with the applicable section hereof; nor shall
    the Trustee, Tandy or the Committee or any other person be
    under any duty to enforce the payment of the contributions to
    be made under the applicable sections hereof; and the
    determination by the Company of its contributions hereunder
    shall be final and conclusive upon all persons.

         H.   REVERSION AND DIVERSION:

               (1)   REVERSION:  Under no circumstances can a
    Company recover any part of the contributions made to this
    Program and credited to a Participant's account.

              (2)  DIVERSION:  No part of the Trust Fund created
    by  this Program except as required to pay taxes and
    administrative expenses, shall be used or diverted to
    purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the
    Participants or their beneficiaries or estates.
                                 III

    Trustee shall receive any contributions paid to it in cash or
    Tandy Stock. All contributions so received, and Tandy Stock
    purchased therefrom, shall be known for purposes of this
    Agreement as the "Trust Fund", and shall be held, managed and
    administered in Trust at the request of and for the benefit
    of Participants pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The
    Trustee hereby accepts the Trust created hereunder and agrees
    to perform the duties provided for under this Agreement.

         B.   POWERS OF THE TRUSTEE:  The Trustee shall have all
    the powers granted by the terms of Title 9 of the Property
    Code of the State of Texas as it now exists, or as it may be
    amended, and in addition thereto and not in modification or
    limitation thereof, the Trustee shall have the following
    powers:

               (1)  To invest the contributions and earnings
    thereon of Tandy or Company in Tandy Stock as soon as
    practicable  after receipt thereof, but to  hold cash
    temporarily uninvested without liability for interest thereon
    when the investment of such cash is impracticable;

              (2)  To keep the Trust Fund in Tandy Stock, to meet
    contemplated withdrawals, as the Committee shall specify in
    written requests;

               (3)  To hold Tandy Stock purchased as investments
    for the Trust Fund in its name or in the name of its
    nominees;

               (4)  To sell, exchange, convey, transfer, or
    otherwise dispose of any Tandy Stock held by it, by private
    contract or at public auction, to fund Financial Hardship
    withdrawals on behalf of and for the benefit of the affected
    Participant;

               (5)  Subject to Section XII hereof, to vote upon
    any stocks, bonds, or other securities; to give general or
    special proxies or powers of attorney with or without power
    of substitution; to exercise any conversion privileges,
    subscription rights or other options; and to make any
    payments incidental thereto; to oppose or consent to or
    otherwise participate in, corporate reorganization or other
    change affecting corporate securities and to delegate
    discretionary powers, and to pay any assessments or charges
    in connection therewith; and generally to exercise any of the
    powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, securities
    or other properties held as a part of the Trust Fund;

              (6)  To settle, compromise or submit to arbitration
    any claims, debts or damages due or owing to or from the
    Trust Fund, to commence or defend suits or legal or
    administrative proceedings; or

               (7)  To delegate to Tandy and/or the Committee by
    agreement in writing, such ministerial, record keeping and
    discretionary duties as may be agreed upon, including but not
    limited  to the maintenance of records of account of
    Participants, the quarterly determination of each
    Participant's account, and the number of shares of Tandy
    Stock purchased, delivered, or distributed by it.

               The powers granted to the Trustee under this
    Section III B shall be exercised by the Trustee in its
    discretion; however, the Committee may at any time and from
    time to time, by written direction to the Trustee, require
    the Trustee to obtain the written approval of the Committee
    before exercising such powers, as may be specified in such
    direction. Any such direction may be of a continuing nature
    or otherwise, and may be revoked in writing by the Committee
    at any time. Neither the Trustee nor any other person shall
    be under any duty to question any such direction of the
    Committee and the Trustee shall as promptly as possible
    comply with any directions given by the Committee hereunder.
    The Trustee shall not be responsible for any loss which may
    result from the failure or refusal of the Committee to give
    any such required approval.

          C.    INVESTMENT OF THE TRUST FUND:  The Trustee shall
    at regular intervals at current market prices invest all of
    the assets of the Trust Fund in Tandy Stock.

          D.    PAYMENTS FROM THE FUND:  The Trustee shall from
    time to time, on the written direction of the Committee, make
    distributions out of the Trust Fund to the Participants or
    the Participants' Beneficiaries, estates or Alternate Payees,
    in such manner, in such Tandy Stock, and for such purposes as
    may be specified in written directives of the Committee and
    upon any such distribution being made, the amount thereof
    shall no longer constitute a part of the Trust Fund.  The
    Trustee shall not be responsible in any way for the
    application of such distributions or for the adequacy of the
    Trust Fund to meet and discharge any and all liabilities
    under the Program.

          E.    FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE TRUSTEE:  The Trustee
    shall be paid such reasonable compensation as shall from time
    to time be agreed upon in writing by Tandy and the Trustee.
    In  addition, the Trustee shall be reimbursed for any
    reasonable expenses, including reasonable counsel  fees,
    incurred by it in the administration of the Trust Fund,
    except as hereinafter provided.  Such compensation  and
    expenses incurred shall be paid by Tandy, but until paid
    shall constitute a charge upon the Trust Fund; provided,
    however, that Tandy shall have no obligation to pay such
    compensation and expenses, including counsel fees, as are
    charged to the accounts of Participants by a court of
    competent jurisdiction in any litigation in which the Program
    or any of its fiduciaries are a party.  All costs and
    expenses incurred in connection with the purchase, sale and
    transfer of securities, and all taxes of any and all kinds
    whatsoever that may be levied or assessed under existing or
    future laws upon, or in respect of, the Trust Fund, or the
    income thereof, shall be paid by the Trustee from the Trust
    Fund.

           F.    ACCOUNTING:  The Trustee, or Tandy or the
    Committee by written agreement with the Trustee, shall keep
    accurate and detailed accounts of all receipts, disbursements
    and other transactions hereunder.

          Within a reasonable time after the close of the Program
    Year and within one hundred twenty (120) days following the
    resignation or removal of the Trustee or termination of the
    Program, the Trustee shall render a complete accounting for
    the Program Year preceding or then ended, as the case may be,
    to a firm of independent public accountants to be selected by
    Tandy. Such accountants shall have full authority to examine
    the Trustee's records and accounts relating to the Program
    and to submit written reports thereon to Tandy.

          Within a reasonable time after the close of the taxable
    year of the Trust, which is hereby established to end on
    December 31 of each year, and within one hundred twenty (120)
    days following the resignation or removal of the Trustee or
    termination of the Trust, the Trustee shall render a complete
    accounting for the taxable year preceding or then ended, as
    the case may be, to Tandy or to a firm of independent public
    accountants to be selected by Tandy. Such accountants shall
    have full authority to examine the Trustee's records and
    accounts relating to the Trust and to submit written reports
    thereon to Tandy.

          Within a reasonable time after the close of the Program
    Year, the Trustee shall transmit to each Participant, in such
    form as the Trustee shall determine, a statement setting
    forth the interest of each such Participant in the Program.
    Such statement shall be deemed correct unless written notice
    to the contrary shall be delivered to the Trustee by a
    Participant within thirty (30) days following the mailing or
    delivery of such statement to the Participant.

          Reports relating to the Trustee's accounts prepared by
    independent accountants selected by Tandy shall be maintained
    at the principal office of Tandy and shall be available for
    inspection by interested persons hereunder. Subject to the
    right of a Participant to challenge the correctness of an
    annual statement submitted to him by the Trustee, the
    approval by the independent accountants of the Trustee's
    account shall constitute a complete release and discharge of
    the Trustee from any liability in respect to any act or
    transaction  reflected in the Trustee's accounts.  The
    foregoing provisions notwithstanding, no person other than
    Tandy or the Committee may require an accounting or the
    furnishing of a statement or bring an action against the
    Trustee with respect to the Trust created hereby or its
    actions as Trustee.

          Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, the
    Trustee shall not be liable for any failure to submit an
    account or statement in a timely fashion where its failure to
    act is based on the omission of Tandy to name a firm of
    independent accountants to whom such accounting is to be
    rendered or is based on the failure of either Tandy or the
    Committee to supply information to the Trustee necessary for
    the completion of the accounting or of the statement.

          G.   AUTHORIZATION TO PROTECT THE TRUSTEE:  Any action
    by Tandy pursuant to any of the provisions of this Agreement
    shall be evidenced by a certified resolution of its Board of
    Directors delivered to the Trustee over the signature of any
    person authorized by the said Board of Directors to make such
    written instrument or resolution so certified to it.  All
    orders, requests and instructions of the Committee shall be
    in writing, signed by those members or that member of the
    Committee so designated by the Committee, and the Trustee may
    act and shall be fully protected in so acting in accordance
    with such orders, requests and instructions.  The Trustee
    shall not be liable for any loss to or diminution of the
    Trust Fund except when the same may be due to its willful
    misconduct or bad faith and the Trustee shall in no event
    have any responsibility for the properties except those
    actually received by it.

          H.    REMOVAL AND RESIGNATION; SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE:  The
    Trustee may be removed by Tandy at any time upon thirty (30)
    days notice in writing to Trustee and the Committee.  The
    Trustee may resign at any time upon thirty (30) days notice
    in writing to Tandy and to the Committee. Upon such removal
    or resignation of the Trustee, Tandy shall appoint  a
    successor trustee, which shall be a bank or trust company
    having combined capital and surplus of not less than Twenty-
    Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.), which shall have the
    same powers and duties conferred upon the Trustee hereunder.
    Upon acceptance of such appointment by the successor trustee,
    the Trustee shall assign, transfer and pay over to such
    successor trustee the funds and properties then constituting
    the Trust Fund.  The Trustee is authorized, however, to
    reserve such sum of money, as it may deem  advisable, for
    payment of its fees and expenses in connection with the
    settlement of its account or otherwise, and any balance of
    such reserve remaining after the payment of such fees and
    expenses shall be paid over to the successor trustee.

                                 IV

                    PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM

          A.    ADOPTION OF PROGRAM.  Tandy and each of its
    affiliates and associates may adopt the Program for all or
    part of its employees as its Board of Directors may in its
    discretion approve. Tandy and each of its affiliates and
    associates adopting the Program are hereinafter collectively
    referred to as "Company".

         B.   ELIGIBILITY.  Subject to the provisions of Section
    XX with respect to union-represented employees, all employees
    are  eligible to participate in the Program if  their
    contributions are limited in any Tandy Fund, formerly DIP,
    plan year ("Tandy Fund Plan Year") as a result of Internal
    Revenue Code Sections 402(g), 415(c), 401(a)(17) and/or
    401(k)(3) and following an election to participate being
    received in the Program's administrative office, may make
    contributions to the Program as a Participant for the
    remainder of any Tandy Fund Plan Year after the date on which
    the contribution limit is reached.  Participation in the
    Program is entirely voluntary and the election to participate
    may be made through Employee Payroll Deductions under Section
    V.  To remain as a Participant in the Program, an employee
    must continue to be an "Employee" engaged in Continuous Full
    Time Service for Tandy or a Company, or in employment which
    contemplates continued Qualifying Service.

         C.   APPLICATION FOR PARTICIPATION.   In order to become
    a Participant hereunder, each eligible employee shall execute
    a written application wherein he shall evidence:

              1.   His intent to participate in the Program;

              2.    His joinder of this Trust Agreement executed
    by Tandy on his behalf;

              3.   His consent for Employee Payroll Deductions in
    accordance with Section V below; and
              4.     His acknowledgment and consent to the
    withholding of taxes resulting from the Company Contribution
    during the Taxable Year in which the Company Contribution is
    made.

         Once an employee has completed the necessary eligibility
    requirements for participation in the Program, contributions
    under Section V shall begin automatically, but shall be held
    in a suspense account subject to receipt of a payroll
    deduction form by the Program Administration office.  The
    employee shall have thirty (30) days from the automatic
    commencement of participation in the Program to file a
    written application for participation. His participation in
    the Program shall not become effective, however, until the
    start of the next pay period after the application is
    received by the Company or after he has reached the
    contribution limit in any Tandy Fund Plan Year following the
    year of his initial enrollment in the Program.

           In  the event that an eligible employee  making
    contribution during the thirty (30) day period elects not to
    participate in the Program or fails to file a written
    application for participation during the period, payroll
    deductions made by the employee during the period shall be
    returned to the employee and any Company or Other
    Contributions will be canceled.

                                  V

                          INVESTMENT OPTION

         A.   RATE OF PAYROLL DEDUCTION.

               1.   After receipt of a payroll deduction form by
    the Program Administration office, Participants shall have
    Employee Payroll Deductions withheld at the rate of 1%, 2%,
    3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7% or 8% of Earnings, in excess of the
    maximum amount of Earnings needed to reach one of the
    contribution limits to the Tandy Fund, formerly DIP, as set
    out in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Participation in
    the Program is for the remainder of the Tandy Fund Plan Year.

                 2.   Participants  shall  designate  their
    participation and desire to participate through payroll
    deductions  by  means  of a signed  payroll  deduction
    authorization form.  The initial authorization shall
    continue in effect, notwithstanding any change in
    Participant's Earnings, until the Participant becomes
    ineligible for the Program. Deductions made subject to such
    authorization are called "Employee Payroll Deductions".

           B.   COLLECTION AND PAYMENT OF EMPLOYEE PAYROLL
    DEDUCTIONS:  The Company shall withhold and deduct on each
    regular  pay day from each Participant's Earnings  the
    contribution specified. The Company shall pay the Employee
    Payroll Deductions over to Tandy and Tandy will use the
    Employee Payroll Deductions to either deliver cash to the
    Trustee to purchase Tandy Stock or purchase and deliver
    shares of Tandy Stock to the Trustee within thirty (30) days
    following the end of the calendar quarter in which such
    contributions shall have been deducted and withheld. In the
    event a Participant withdraws from the Program and his
    contribution for the calendar quarter preceding the time of
    his withdrawal has been withheld from his Earnings, but has
    not been used for the purchase of Tandy Stock, then the
    Company shall refund to such withdrawing Participant the
    amount of his contribution so withheld.

                                 VI

                       CREDITS TO PARTICIPANTS

          As soon as practicable after the end of each calendar
    quarter  the following credits shall be made to each
    Participant's account as of the end of each calendar quarter:

           A.  EMPLOYEE PAYROLL DEDUCTION.  The amount of
    Employee Payroll Deductions withheld during each month of
    such quarter;

           B.  COMPANY CONTRIBUTION.  A monthly amount (the
    "Company Contribution") calculated in accordance with Section
    VI. B. 1. below:

               1.  The Company Contribution shall be determined
    on the basis of each payroll period by multiplying the
    Employee Payroll Deduction by Eighty Percent (80%); and

               2.  Within thirty (30) days following the end of
    each calendar quarter, the Company shall contribute out of
    its earnings and profits to Tandy and this amount, calculated
    in accordance with Section VI B. 1, shall be delivered to the
    Trustee for the purchase of Tandy Stock or used to purchase
    and deliver Tandy Stock to the Trustee. Except for excess
    contributions made because of fraud or mistake of fact and
    returned within one (1) year after payment to Tandy under
    this Program, no part of the contributions of the Company
    shall be recoverable by it under any circumstances. In the
    event the Company should not have sufficient current earnings
    or profits and be operating at a loss currently and thus be
    unable to pay its full contributions to this Program, then
    such contributions, if any, that it shall be able to make
    shall be allocated among all Participants on the basis of the
    relative amounts of contributions made by each during the
    quarter.

          C.   OTHER CONTRIBUTION-DIVIDEND INCOME ON STOCK.  All
    cash dividends paid on shares credited to the Participant's
    account on the record date designated by Tandy for such
    dividend shall be allocated when paid to each Participant's
    account as other contributions ("Other Contributions") and
    delivered to the Trustee or applied to the purchase of Tandy
    Stock in accordance with Section VI. D. below, for delivery
    to the Trustee.  These Other Contributions will not be
    subject to matching contributions by the Company or Tandy.

          D.  APPLICATION OF CREDITS.  The Employee Payroll
    Deductions, Other Contributions, and Company Contributions
    are to be applied to the acquisition of Tandy Stock quarterly
    and shall be credited to the Participant's account as soon as
    practicable after the end of the calendar quarter as Tandy
    Stock and any Fractional Share (as defined in Section XIX)
    based upon the number of shares of Tandy Stock purchasable at
    a price equal to the average closing price of Tandy Stock as
    reported for the New York Stock Exchange composite
    transactions for each trading day of the calendar month (the
    "Stock Price") for which the deductions or contributions are
    made.

          E.  DIVIDENDS OTHER THAN CASH AND TANDY STOCK.  All
    dividends with respect to Tandy Stock held in a Participant's
    account under the Program that are not payable in cash or
    Tandy Stock shall be distributed to the Participant as soon
    as possible.  All whole units of any security (other than
    Tandy Stock), any rights and warrants for a whole unit of any
    security and whole units of any other asset shall be
    distributed in kind. All fractional units of any security
    (other than Tandy Stock), any rights and warrants for less
    than a whole unit of any security and fractional units of any
    other asset shall be sold and the net proceeds paid to the
    Participant.

          F.  STOCK DIVIDEND OR SPLIT-UP.  Any Tandy Stock
    issuable by Tandy as a stock dividend or split-up on the
    Tandy Stock and any Fractional Share to the credit of the
    Participant on the record date designated by Tandy for such
    stock dividend or split-up shall be credited to  each
    Participant's account (in an amount per share equivalent to
    any stock dividend or split-up actually paid by Tandy on its
    Tandy Stock then outstanding) and delivered to the Trustee as
    soon as practicable after the distribution date of such stock
    dividend or split-up.

                                 VII

                        TRANSFERS TO TRUSTEE

         A.   EMPLOYEE PAYROLL DEDUCTION.  The Company shall pay
    over to Tandy the Employee Payroll Deductions of each
    Participant as soon as practicable after the payroll period
    nearest the end of the calendar month in which such Employee
    Payroll  Deduction is withheld.  The  Employee  Payroll
    Deductions will be credited to the Participant's account
    quarterly and delivered to the Trustee for the purchase of
    Tandy Stock and/or used to purchase Tandy Stock which will be
    delivered to the Trustee as soon as practicable after the end
    of the calendar quarter.

          B.   COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS.  The Company shall account
    for the Company Contributions payable to Tandy on each
    Participant's account as soon as practicable after the
    payroll period nearest the end of the calendar month in which
    such Employee Payroll Deductions are withheld. The Company
    Contributions shall be paid over to Tandy and credited to the
    Participant's account quarterly. Said contributions shall
    then be delivered to the Trustee for the purchase of Tandy
    Stock and/or used to purchase Tandy Stock which will be
    delivered to the Trustee as soon as practicable after the end
    of the calendar quarter.

                                VIII

                             INVESTMENT

         A.   TANDY STOCK.

               1.    The Trustee will invest all or substantially
    all of the Trust Fund in Tandy Stock.

               2.    Any Tandy Stock required for the Program may
   be treasury shares or original issue shares.

               3.    Tandy Stock may be held by the Trustee, as
    custodian, at its discretion either in its name or in the
    name of one or more nominees. Tandy Stock shall be purchased
    and/or delivered to the Trustee as of the end of each
    calendar quarter with respect to which the Tandy Stock is
    acquired by the Program or Trustee and sold by Tandy, at the
    Stock Price determined for each month of the quarter.

          B.   OTHER INTEREST AND INCOME.  Except as herein
    expressly provided, no interest or other income will be paid
    or credited on account of Employee Payroll Deductions,
    Company Contributions, or any other amount payable or
    credited to Participants.

                                 IX

                           HOLDING PERIOD

          A.   DURATION.  The Trustee shall retain for the
    Holding Period, Tandy Stock credited to the Participant's
    account under the Program. The Holding Period with respect
    to any Tandy Stock shall commence on the date as of which the
    Tandy Stock is credited to the Participant's account and
    shall end when the Participant has complied with one of the
    provisions for withdrawal under the Program.

          B.   DISTRIBUTION.  As promptly as practicable after
    the Holding Period, the Trustee shall distribute the full and
    any Fractional Share of Tandy Stock then held which was
    credited to the Participant's account under the Program since
    the Holding Period began in accordance with the rules for
    withdrawals and payment (as defined in Section X).

                                  X

                      WITHDRAWALS AND PAYMENTS

         A.   WITHDRAWALS.

               1.  During employment the Program only provides
    for the full withdrawal of a Participant's account upon
    receipt of a written request and Notice of Financial Hardship
    including  all supporting documentation at the  Program
    Administration office (1800 One Tandy Center, Fort Worth,
    Texas 76102) prior to Program participation termination.  A
    Financial Hardship withdrawal can only be made if the
    withdrawal is to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial
    need of the employee and is necessary to meet such financial
    need and where other sources of payment are not reasonably
    available to the Participant. A withdrawal will be deemed to
    be necessary as a Financial Hardship withdrawal if both of
    the following requirements are met: (1) the withdrawal is
    not in excess of the amount needed to satisfy the Financial
    Hardship plus any amounts necessary to pay any federal, state
    or local taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result
    from such payment; and (2) the Participant has obtained all
    distributions, under all plans of the Company except for
    hardship distributions from the Participant's Deferred Salary
    Account in the Tandy Fund, formerly the Tandy Employees
    Deferred Salary and Investment Plan, and the ESOP account in
    the Tandy Fund, formerly the Tandy Employees Stock Ownership
    Plan.

               2.  The Program also provides for the full
    withdrawal of a Participant's account upon receipt of a
    written Notice of Withdrawal at the Program Administration
    Office upon the Participant's (a) death or (b) termination of
    Employment, either voluntarily, involuntarily or by
    retirement at age 65 or older.

         B.   PAYMENT IN CASH OR TANDY STOCK.

              1.   The Participant will be paid in Tandy Stock if
    the Participant delivers a written Notice of Withdrawal to
    the Program Administration office or if the Company's records
    indicate that one of the above two events of withdrawal (as
    defined in X. A. 2.) has occurred.  All Financial Hardship
    withdrawals will be paid in cash as provided for below.

               2.   Employee Payroll Deductions, Company
    Contributions and Other Contributions not yet paid over or
    delivered as Tandy Stock to the Trustee will be paid over to
    the withdrawing Participant by the Company or Tandy in cash.

               3.    Upon withdrawal no Fractional Share will be
    distributed by the Trustee. In lieu of distribution of such
    Fractional Share of Tandy Stock the Trustee will pay a
    Participant the Stock Price for the month preceding the
    distribution date.

         C.   DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF PAYMENT.   The amount of
    payment in Tandy Stock will be determined by the number of
    shares credited to a Participant's account:

               1.    at the end of the calendar quarter preceding
    the receipt of the written Notice of Withdrawal by the
    Program Administration office; or

               2.    in the absence of receipt by the Program
    Administration office of a Notice of Withdrawal from the
    Participant, Alternate Payee(s), or the Participant's
    Beneficiary, at the end of the calendar quarter preceding the
    month in which one of the two withdrawal events is recorded
    in the records of the Program Administration office,
    regardless of the month in which such event occurred.

    In the event of a Financial Hardship withdrawal, when the
    Participant delivers a written Notice of Financial Hardship
    Withdrawal to the Program Administration office, then the
    Trustee shall take the number of shares of Tandy Stock
    credited to the Participant's account at the end of the
    preceding calendar quarter, value it at the Stock Price for
    the calendar month preceding the date of receipt of the
    notice of  withdrawal, sell such Tandy Stock and then
    distribute cash to the Participant.

          D.    REENTERING THE PROGRAM.  In the event of a
    Financial Hardship withdrawal under this Program a
    Participant may not renew participation for a period of
    twelve (12) months from the date of distribution of the
    withdrawal.

           E.   RECIPIENT OF DISTRIBUTION. All withdrawal
    distributions will be made to the Participant except
    withdrawal distributions resulting from death or divorce of
    the Participant. In the event of death, payment will be made
    to the Beneficiary designated by the Participant or as
    otherwise provided by the Program and the Participant's
    Beneficiary may act in behalf of the Participant. In the
    event of a Participant's divorce, a certified copy of the
    divorce decree or Qualified Domestic Relations Order
    (collectively referred to hereinafter as "Court Order") must
    be submitted to the Program Administration office together
    with any other identifying information as required by the
    Program Administration office. The Participant's account
    will then be divided as specifically ordered in the Court
    Order and the shares awarded to the Alternate Payee(s) will
    be withdrawn. Distribution to the Participant, the Alternate
    Payee(s), or Beneficiary shall be made as soon as practicable
    after the event permitting withdrawal.

          F.    SUSPENSION FROM THE PROGRAM.   In the event of a
    Participant's withdrawal from the Tandy Fund, formerly DIP,
    the Participant will be suspended from participation in the
    Program as set out below:

               1.   Partial Withdrawal.   If a Participant elects
    to withdraw all or any portion of the value of his Voluntary
    account under the Tandy Fund, formerly DIP, if any, his
    participation in the Program does not terminate, but his
    Employee Payroll Deductions and Company Contributions shall
    automatically be suspended for a period of six months.

               2.   Total Withdrawal.  If a Participant elects to
    withdraw the full value of his Company account under the
    Tandy Fund, formerly DIP, while employed by Company, his
    participation under the Program is suspended for a period of
    12 months, during which no Employee Payroll Deductions or
    Company Contributions will be made.

              3.   Tandy Fund, formerly DIP, Hardship Withdrawal.
    If a participant makes a financial hardship withdrawal under
    the Tandy Fund, formerly DIP, his participation under the
    Program is suspended for a period of 12 months from the date
    of distribution of the withdrawal, during which period no
    Employee Payroll Deductions or Company Contributions will be
    made.

                                 XI

                             BENEFICIARY

          A.    DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY.   Participants shall
    file with the Company a written designation of Beneficiary
    designating who is to receive any Tandy Stock, Fractional
    Share payment, and any cash to the Participant's credit under
    the Program in the event of his death prior to delivery to
    him of such Tandy Stock, Fractional Share payment or cash.

          B.    CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY.   A Participant may change
    his Beneficiary designation at any time by written notice
    being delivered to the Program Administration office.  Such
    change shall take effect as of the date the Participant
    signed such written notice, whether or not Participant is
    living at the time of receipt of such notice by the Program
    Administration office, except that the change of Beneficiary
    shall not be effective if the Program has distributed the
    Participant's account prior to receipt of the change of
    Beneficiary form.

         C.   DISTRIBUTIONS TO BENEFICIARY.   Upon the death of a
    Participant and upon receipt of proof deemed adequate by the
    Program Administration office of the identity and existence
    at the Participant's death of a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries
    validly designated by him under the Program, distribution
    will be made to the Beneficiary or Beneficiaries in the
    manner and form as set forth in Section X hereof.

          D.    ABSENCE OF BENEFICIARY.   In the absence of a
    Beneficiary designated under the Program who is living at the
    time of Participant's death, distribution shall be made to
    the  executor or administrator of the estate  of  the
    Participant.  If no executor or administrator has been
    appointed to the knowledge of the Program Administration
    office (or in the event such executor or administrator has
    been disqualified), distribution may be made to such person
    or persons as the Program Administration office shall be
    satisfied is or are legally entitled thereto.

         E.   INTEREST OF BENEFICIARY IN PROGRAM.   No designated
    Beneficiary shall, prior to the death of the Participant by
    whom he has been designated, acquire any interest in the
    Tandy Stock, Fractional Share, or cash credited to the
    Participant under the Program or in the assets of the Trust.

                                 XII

                 VOTING AND TENDERING OF TANDY STOCK

           A.     VOTING  OF  TANDY  STOCK  BY  PARTICIPANTS  AND
    BENEFICIARIES.     Notwithstanding any provision contained in
    the Program to the contrary, or:

               1.  The Trustee shall have the power to vote all
    Tandy Stock held by it on matters which may be voted by
    Member Organizations of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
    without customer instructions as provided in Rule 452 of the
    Rules of the Board of Directors of the New York Stock
    Exchange, Inc. (Supplementary Material Item .11).

              2.  With respect to matters other than those
    described in Subsection 1 of this Section A of this Article
    ("Pass Through Matters"), each Participant or Beneficiary who
    timely provides instructions to the Trustee shall be entitled
    to direct the Trustee how to vote Tandy Stock allocated to
    such Participant's or Beneficiary's accounts in accordance
    with this Section.  In order to implement these voting
    directions,  Tandy or the Trustee shall  provide  each
    Participant or Beneficiary with proxy solicitation materials
    or other notices or an information statement which are
    distributed to Tandy shareholders, together with a form
    requesting confidential instructions as to the manner in
    which  Tandy  Stock allocated to the Participant's  or
    Beneficiary's account are to be voted. Each Participant or
    Beneficiary shall, as a named fiduciary described in Section
    403(a)(1) of ERISA, direct the Trustee with respect to the
    vote of such Tandy Stock allocated to the account of the
    Participant or Beneficiary.  Reasonable means shall  be
    employed by the Trustee to provide confidentiality with
    respect to the voting by such Participant or Beneficiary and
    the Trustee shall hold such directions in confidence and
    shall not divulge or release such directions to any person,
    including Tandy or any director, officer, employee or agent
    of Tandy, it being the intent of this provision of this
    Section to ensure that Tandy (and its directors, officers,
    employees and agents) cannot determine the direction given by
    any Participant or Beneficiary. Such instructions shall be
    in such form and shall be filed in such manner and at such
    time as the Trustee may prescribe.

              3.  On Pass-Through Matters, the Trustee shall
    vote all Tandy Stock which is allocated to Participants' and
    Beneficiaries' accounts for which it does not receive timely
    or valid voting instructions in the same proportion as Tandy
    Stock which is allocated to Participants' and Beneficiaries'
    accounts for which it does receive timely and valid voting
    instructions.

          B.    TENDER  OFFERS.   The provisions of this Section
    shall apply in the event any "Person" (as the term person is
    used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), either alone or in
    conjunction with others, makes a tender offer, or exchange
    offer, or otherwise offers to purchase, or solicits an offer
    to  sell to such Person, one percent or more of the
    outstanding Company securities (hereinafter referred to as a
    "Tender Offer").

               1.    The Trustee may not take any action in
    response to a Tender Offer except as otherwise provided in
    this Section B of this Article XII. Upon commencement of a
    Tender Offer, Tandy or the Trustee shall notify  each
    Participant or Beneficiary for whom an account is maintained
    of such Tender Offer and use its best efforts to timely
    distribute or cause to be distributed to each Participant or
    Beneficiary all information, documents and other materials as
    are distributed to shareholders of the Tandy with the Tender
    Offer. Each Participant or Beneficiary shall be entitled to
    direct the Trustee to sell, offer to sell, exchange or
    otherwise dispose of the Tandy Stock allocated to such
    Participant's or Beneficiary's accounts in accordance with
    the provisions, conditions and terms of such Tender Offer and
    the provisions of this Section.  Such a Participant or
    Beneficiary shall direct the Trustee with respect to the
    tender of such shares of Tandy Stock which are allocated to
    the accounts of the Participant or Beneficiary.  Reasonable
    means  shall  be employed by the Trustee  to  provide
    confidentiality with respect to the tendering directions by
    each Participant or Beneficiary and the Trustee shall hold
    such directions in confidence and shall not divulge or
    release such directions to any person, including Tandy or any
    director, officer, employee or agent of Tandy, it being the
    intent of this provision of this Section to ensure that Tandy
    (and its directors, officers, employees and agents) cannot
    determine the tendering directions given by any Participant
    or Beneficiary. Such instructions shall be in such form and
    shall be filed in such manner and at such time as the Trustee
    may prescribe.

               2.   A Participant or Beneficiary who has directed
    the Trustee to tender or exchange Tandy Stock may, at any
    time prior to the tender or exchange offer withdrawal date,
    or such earlier date as established by the Trustee, instruct
    the Trustee to withdraw, and the Trustee shall withdraw, such
    Tandy Stock from the tender or exchange offer prior to the
    withdrawal deadline.  The Trustee may impose reasonable
    limits on the number of instructions to tender or exchange or
    withdraw which a Participant or Beneficiary may give to the
    Trustee.

               3.   The Trustee shall sell, offer to sell,
    exchange or otherwise dispose of the Tandy Stock allocated to
    a Participant's or Beneficiary's account with respect to
    which it has received directions to do so under this Section
    and which have not been withdrawn.  The proceeds of a
    disposition directed by a Participant or Beneficiary shall be
    allocated to such Participant's or Beneficiary's account.

               4.   To the extent to which Participants or
    Beneficiaries do not instruct the Trustee, or do not issue
    valid directions to the Trustee, to sell, offer to sell,
    exchange or otherwise dispose of the Tandy Stock allocated to
    their accounts, such Participants or Beneficiaries shall be
    deemed to have directed the Trustee that their respective
    accounts remain invested in Tandy Stock subject to all
    provisions of the Program.

               5.   Following the completion of a Tender Offer,
    the Committee may direct the substitution of new "qualified
    employer securities" as such term is defined in Internal
    Revenue Code Section 409(1) for Tandy Stock or for the
    proceeds of any disposition of Tandy Stock to the extent
    provided in the Program; provided, however, that any
                             --------  -------
    such substitute employer securities must be publicly traded
    securities.  In lieu of the substitution of new qualified
    employer securities, the Committee may direct that the Trust
    Fund  be  invested in other securities, properties  or
    investment vehicles.  Pending the reinvestment  of  any
    disposition of Tandy Stock, the Trust Fund may be invested in
    such securities, property or investment vehicles as the
    Committee may from time to time direct; provided, however,
                                            --------  -------
    in the absence of any direction from the Committee, the
    Trustee may invest the cash proceeds in short-term securities
    issued by the United States of America or any agency or
    instrumentality thereof or any other investment of a
    short-term nature, including  corporate obligations or
    participations therein and collective or common investment
    funds.

                                XIII

                PARTICIPATION BY AFFILIATED COMPANIES

         This Program shall apply to any corporation a portion of
    whose voting stock is owned directly or indirectly by Tandy,
    and any of its affiliates, if such company or corporation
    shall elect to participate and if, and so long as, such
    participation shall be approved by Tandy. Each participating
    Company shall be bound by the terms of this document.

                                 XIV

                   NO WARRANTY OF SECURITY VALUES

           Neither the Trustee or Company, their officers,
    directors, agents or servants, warrants or represents in any
    way that the value of Tandy Stock in which the Participant
    may have an interest will increase or will not decrease.
    Each Participant assumes all risk in connection with any
    changes in the value of Tandy Stock to the extent he may have
    an interest therein.

                                 XV

                         GENERAL PROVISIONS

           A.     EXTENT  OF CERTAIN RIGHTS OF PARTICIPANTS.
    Participation in the Program shall not entitle any employee
    to be retained in the service of Company.  The at-will
    employment right and power of Company to dismiss or discharge
    any employee is specifically reserved.

           B.   LIMITATION  OF PARTICIPANT'S  RIGHTS.   No
    Participant nor any person claiming under or through them
    shall have any right or interest under the Program that is
    not herein expressly granted.

           C.  ASSIGNMENT.  No interest in any Tandy Stock or
    cash held under the Program prior to delivery to the
    Participant as hereinabove provided, shall be assigned,
    alienated, pledged, or otherwise encumbered in whole or in
    part, either directly by operation of law, or otherwise.  If
    any attempt is made by a Participant to assign, alienate,
    pledge, or otherwise encumber his interest in such Tandy
    Stock or cash, prior to such delivery, for his debts,
    liabilities in tort or contract, or otherwise, then the
    Committee (in its absolute discretion) may treat such attempt
    as an election by the Participant to withdraw from the
    Program permanently and submit to any loss of rights as
    provided in the Program in the case of a withdrawal at the
    time of such attempt, except that a Court Order, to pay an
    Alternate Payee(s), issued upon a Participant's divorce shall
    not be a violation under this paragraph which requires a
    Participant's withdrawal.

           D.  QUARTERLY STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS.  As soon as
    practicable after the end of each calendar quarter, each
    Participant shall be furnished with a statement of Tandy
    Stock credited to his account under the Program.

            E.   REGISTRATION OF STOCK.  Each  Participant,
    Beneficiary or Alternate Payee shall, at such time as the
    Program Administration office or Tandy may  reasonably
    request, furnish written instructions for the registration of
    the Tandy Stock to be delivered under the Program upon
    completion of the Holding Period. Such Tandy Stock will be
    registered in the name of the Participant, Beneficiary or
    Alternate Payee (or if a minor, in the name of another person
    as custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, or if
    incompetent, in the  name of the guardian or such other
    person(s) as the Program Administrative Committee or Tandy
    may determine) alone or in his name and that of one such
    other adult person as he may designate as joint tenants with
    right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.  Such
    instructions shall remain in effect until receipt by the
    Program  Administration office or Tandy of written
    instructions to change the registration previously
    authorized.  In the absence of such written instructions,
    Tandy Stock to be delivered to a Participant will be
    registered in his name or the Alternate Payee's name alone
    or in the event of his death prior to such delivery will be
    registered in the name of the person or persons entitled
    thereto.

         F.   MISCELLANEOUS.

               1.   The Trustee may rely upon the authenticity of
    any information supplied to it by the Company in connection
    with the operation of the Program, and shall be fully
    protected in relying upon such information.

               2.   No individual administering, or aiding in the
    administration of the Program or the Trust shall have any
    liability, except as provided in Section XV.F.3. below. As a
    condition precedent to participation in the Program or the
    receipt of benefits thereunder, such liability if any, is
    expressly waived and released by each Participant and by any
    and all persons claiming under or through any Participant
    such waiver and release to be conclusively evidenced by the
    act of participation or the acceptance of benefits
    thereunder.

               3.   No individual administering, or aiding in the
    administration of, the Program shall be liable except for his
    own acts or omissions and then only for willful misfeasance,
    bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the
    duties involved in the conduct of his office. As used
    herein, "individual administering, or aiding in the
    administration of the Program" shall include any share owner,
    director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
    Trustee.

              4.   Tandy or the Program Administration office may
    require compliance with any legal requirements which it deems
    necessary as a condition for delivery of, or payment for, any
    Tandy Stock or cash to the credit of a Participant under the
    Program.

              5.   By a Participant's act of participating in the
    Program  or by the acceptance of any of the benefits
    thereunder, such Participant and any and all persons claiming
    under or through any such Participant, shall thereby be
    conclusively deemed to have indicated his acceptance and
    ratification of, and consent to, the application of the
    provisions of the Program.

               6.   Tandy Stock purchased, sold or transferred
    under the Program by Tandy or the Trustee may be either
    treasury shares or newly issued shares.

               7.   No Participant, beneficiary of a Participant,
    or any other person shall have any right or claim to the
    Trust Fund except as specified in the Program and this Trust
    Agreement. Any disputes as to the amount of benefits payable
    or distributable under this Trust shall be resolved by the
    Committee, whose decision shall be final. No Participant or
    any other person shall have any right or claim with respect
    to disputed benefits against the Trust, the Trustee or
    Company.

               8.   The determination of any question relating to
    the construction, interpretation, administration or
    application of the Program and its rules and regulations is
    vested solely in the Committee and all Participant's and
    other persons shall be bound thereby.

               9.    For the purposes of the Program, unless the
    contrary is clearly indicated by the context, the use of the
    masculine gender shall also include within its meaning the
    feminine, and the use of the singular shall also include
    within its meaning the plural, and vice versa.

          A.    TO PARTICIPANTS.  All notices, reports and other
    communications to a Participant under or in connection with

    Participant at his address last appearing on the records of
    the Company.

          B.    BY  PARTICIPANTS.   All notices, instructions or

                AMENDMENT, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION

          A.    AUTHORITY TO AMEND, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE.  The
    Tandy Board of Directors, without notice to a Participant,
    may amend, suspend or terminate the Program at any time, or
    from time to time. Without limitation, such amendment may
    change (a) the rates of Employee Payroll Deductions which may
    be designated by all Participants or (b) the rate of Company
    Contributions, or (c) any other provisions of the Program,
    except a Participant's percentage rate of Employee Payroll
    Deductions may not be increased without his consent.

          B.    DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.  The Tandy Board of
    Directors may delegate to the Chairman of the Board, Vice
    Chairman of the Board, or President the authority to amend
    any provision of this Program, provided such amendment is
    (a) of an administrative nature or (b) does not result in any
    material increase in costs to a Company.

           C.     AMENDMENTS.    No amendment, suspension or
    termination shall adversely affect any rights of a
    Participant to Tandy Stock, Fractional Share payment or cash
    to his credit under the Program as of the date of amendment,
    suspension or termination. Upon such termination, all Tandy
    Stock, Fractional Share payment or cash to the credit of each
    Participant under the Program shall be promptly paid over to
    him.

          Any question concerning or in respect of the validity,
    construction, interpretation, administration and effect of
    the Program, and of its rules and regulations, and the rights
    of any or all persons having or claiming to have an interest
    therein or thereunder, shall be governed exclusively and
    solely in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas,
    with Jurisdiction for any action being expressly agreed as
    being in Tarrant County, Texas where all contributions to the
    Trust are deemed to take place.

                                XXII

                          CHANGE IN CONTROL

         A.   Notwithstanding any provision contained in the Plan
    to the contrary, for a period of one (1) year following a
    Change in Control (as hereinafter defined), the Program may
    not be terminated or amended in any way that would adversely
    affect the computation or amount of, or entitlement to,
    benefits hereunder, including, but not limited to, (a) any
    reduction in the right to make Employee Payroll Deductions by
    any individual who was an eligible employee on the date
    immediately prior to a Change in Control, (b) a reduction in
    the level of Company Contributions with respect to such
    individuals or (c) any change in the distribution  or
    withdrawal provisions. Any amendment or termination of the
    Program that (i) was at the request of a third party who has
    indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably calculated
    to effect a Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in
    connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in Control
    shall be null and void, and shall have no effect whatsoever.

          B.   For purposes of the Program, a "Change in Control"
    shall mean any of the following events:

               1.    An acquisition (other than directly from
    Tandy) of any voting securities of Tandy (the "Voting
    Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person is used for
    purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) immediately after
    which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
    meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    Tandy's  then  outstanding Voting Securities;
    provided, however, in determining whether a Change in Control
    -------- -------
    has occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a "Non-
    Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
    constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in
    Control.  A  "Non-Control Acquisition" shall  mean  an
    acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan ( or a trust
    forming a part thereof) maintained by (i) the Company or (ii)
    any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its
    voting power or its voting equity securities or equity
    interest  is owned, directly or indirectly,  by  Tandy
    (a "Subsidiary"), (2) Tandy or its Subsidiaries, or (3) any
    Person in connection with a "Non-Control Transaction" (as
    hereinafter defined);

              2.   The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990 are
    members of the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any
    reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the Board;
    provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for
    -------- -------
    election by Tandy's stockholders, of any new director was
    approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent
    Board, such new director shall, for purposes of the Program,
    be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board;
    provided further, however, that no individual shall
    -------- -------  -------
    be considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such
    individual initially assumed office as a result of either an
    actual or threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule
    14a-11 promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or
    threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on
    behalf of a Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest")
    including by reason of any agreement intended to avoid or
    settle any Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

         3.   Approval by stockholders of Tandy of:

                   (i)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization
              involving Tandy, unless

                 (I) the stockholders of Tandy,
            immediately before such merger, consolidation
            or reorganization, own, directly or indirectly
            immediately   following   such   merger,
            consolidation or reorganization, at  least
            sixty percent (60%) of the combined voting
            power of the outstanding voting securities of
            the corporation resulting from such merger or
            consolidation  or  reorganization   (the
            "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the
            same proportion as their ownership of the
            Voting Securities immediately before  such
            merger, consolidation or reorganization,

                  (II) the individuals who  were
            members of the Incumbent Board immediately
            prior  to the execution of the agreement
            providing for such merger, consolidation or
            reorganization constitute at least two-thirds
            of the members of the board of directors of
            the Surviving Corporation,

                 (III)   no Person (other than any
            Tandy Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan
            (or  any  trust forming a part  thereof)
            maintained  by  Tandy,  the  Surviving
            Corporation, or any Tandy Subsidiary, or any
            Person who, immediately prior to such merger,
            consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial
            Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of
            the then outstanding Voting Securities) has
            Beneficial Ownership of fifteen percent (15%)
            or more of the combined voting power of the
            Surviving  Corporation's  then  outstanding
            voting securities, and

                 (IV) a transaction described in
            clauses (I) through (III) shall herein be
            referred to as a "Non-Control Transaction";

               (ii)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of
              Tandy; or

               (iii) An agreement for the sale or other
              disposition of all or substantially all of the
              assets of Tandy to any Person (other than a
              transfer to a Tandy Subsidiary).

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall
    not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the
    "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than
    the permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as
    a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by Tandy
    which,  by  reducing the number of  Voting  Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
                                              --------
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of acquisition of Voting Securities by
    Tandy, and after such share acquisition by Tandy, the Subject
    Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any  additional Voting
    Securities which  increases  the percentage  of  the then
    outstanding Voting  Securities Beneficially Owned by the
    Subject Person, then a Change in Control shall occur.

          C.    Notwithstanding any provision  contained in the
    Program to the contrary, no provision of this Article XXII
    may be amended at any time.

          D.    Notwithstanding any provision contained in the
    Program to the contrary, the provisions of this Article XXII
    shall be binding upon Tandy and its successors and assigns.

          E.    Notwithstanding any provision contained in the
    Program to the contrary, the provisions of this Article XXII
    shall  be  deemed  severable  and  the  validity  or
    unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
    validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

          F.    The provisions of this Article XXII shall govern
    notwithstanding anything contained in the Program to the
    contrary.

          IN  WITNESS WHEREOF, Tandy and the Trustee have  caused
    this  Agreement  to  be  executed  by  their  duly  appointed
    officers and their corporate seals to be hereunto affixed  as
    of the date first written above.

                                  Corporation") in substantially
                                  the same proportion as their
                                  ownership of the Voting
                                  Securities immediately before

                                  immediately prior to the
                                  execution of the agreement
                                  providing for such merger,

                                  maintained by the Company, the
                                  Surviving Corporation or any

                                  immediately prior to such
                                  merger, consolidation or

                                  (15%) or more of the then
                                  outstanding Voting Securities)
                                  has Beneficial Ownership of
                                  fifteen percent (15%) or more
                                  of the combined voting power of
                                  the Surviving Corporation's
                                  then outstanding voting
                                  securities, and

                                  (4)  a transaction described in
                                  clauses (1) through (3) shall
                                  herein be referred to as a
                                  "Non-Control Transaction;"

                             (B)  A complete liquidation or
                             dissolution of the Company; or

                             (C) An agreement for the sale or
                             other disposition of all or
                             substantially all of the assets of
                             the Company to any Person (other
                             than a transfer to a Subsidiary).

                   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in
                   Control shall not be deemed to occur solely
                   because any Person (the "Subject Person")
                   acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the
                   permitted amount of the outstanding Voting
                   Securities as a result of the acquisition of
                   Voting Securities by the Company which, by
                   reducing the number of Voting Securities
                   outstanding, increases the proportional number
                   of shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject
                   Person, provided that is a Change in Control
                   would occur (but for the operation of this
                   sentence) as a result of the acquisition of
                   Voting Securities by the Company, and after
                   such share acquisition by the Company, the
                   Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
                   any additional Voting Securities which
                   increases the percentage of the then
                   outstanding Voting Securities Beneficially
                   Owned by the Subject Person, then
                   a Change in Control shall occur.

                      (b)  Claim:  any threatened, pending or
                           -----
                 completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
                 civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
                 or other, including, without limitation, an
                 action by or in the right of any other
                 corporation of any type or kind, domestic or

                 trust, employee benefit plan or other
                 enterprise, whether predicated on foreign,
                 federal, state or local law and whether formal
                 or informal.

                      (c)  Expenses:  include attorney's fees and
                           --------
                 all other costs, charges and expenses paid or
                 incurred in connection with investigating,
                 defending, being a witness in or participating
                 in (including on appeal), or preparing to
                 defend, be a witness in or participate in any
                 Claim relating to any Indemnifiable Event.

                      (d)  Indemnifiable Event:  any event or
                           -------------------
                 occurrence related to the fact that Indemnitee
                 is or was or has agreed to become a director,
                 officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the
                 Company, or is or was serving or has agreed to
                 serve in any capacity, at the request of the
                 Company, in any other corporation, partnership,
                 joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or
                 other enterprise, or by reason of anything done
                 or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity.

                      (e)  Potential Change of Control: shall be
                           ---------------------------
                 deemed to have occurred if (i) the Company
                 enters into an agreement or arrangement, the
                 consummation of which would result in the
                 occurrence of a Change in control; or (ii) the
                 Board adopts a resolution to the effect that,
                 for purposes of this Agreement, a Potential
                 Change in control has occurred.

                      (f)  Voting Securities:  any securities of
                           -----------------
                 the Company which vote generally in the election
                 of directors.

       2.   Basic Indemnification Arrangement:
            ---------------------------------
                      (a)  In the event Indemnitee was, is or
                 becomes a party to or witness or other
                 participant in, or is threatened to be made a
                 party to or witness or other participant in, a
                 Claim by reason of (or arising in part out of)
                 an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall
                 indemnify Indemnitee (without regard to the
                 negligence or other fault of the Indemnitee) to
                 the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
                 as soon as practicable but in no event later
                 than thirty days after written demand is
                 presented to the Company, against any and all
                 Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, excise
                 taxes and amounts paid or to be paid in
                 settlement (including all interest, assessments
                 and other charges paid or payable in connection
                 with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments,
                 fines, penalties, excise taxes or amounts paid
                 or to be paid in settlement) of such Claim.  If
                 Indemnitee makes a request to be indemnified
                 under this Agreement, the Board of Directors
                 (acting by a quorum consisting of directors who
                 are not parties to the Claim with respect to an
                 Indemnifiable Event or, if such a quorum is not
                 obtainable, acting upon an opinion in writing of
                 independent legal counsel ("Board Action")
                 shall, as soon as practicable but in no event
                 later than thirty days after such request,
                 authorize such indemnification.  Notwithstanding
                 anything in the Restated Certificate of
                 Incorporation of the Company (the "Certificate
                 of Incorporation"), the Bylaws of the Company or
                 this Agreement to the contrary, following a
                 Change in Control, Indemnitee shall, unless
                 prohibited by law, be entitled to
                 indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in
                 connection with any Claim initiated by
                 Indemnitee.

                      (b)  Notwithstanding anything in the
                 Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or this
                 Agreement to the contrary, if so requested by
                 Indemnitee, the Company shall advance (within
                 two business days of such request) any and all
                 Expenses relating to a Claim to Indemnitee (an
                 "Expense Advance"), upon the receipt of a
                 written undertaking by or on behalf of
                 Indemnitee to repay such Expense Advance if a
                 judgment or other final adjudication adverse to
                 Indemnitee (as to which all rights or appeal
                 therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed)
                 establishes that Indemnitee, with respect to
                 such Claim, is not eligible for indemnification.

                      (c)  Notwithstanding anything in the
                 Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or this
                 Agreement to the contrary, if Indemnitee has
                 commenced legal proceedings in a court of
                 competent jurisdiction to secure a determination
                 that Indemnitee should be indemnified under this
                 Agreement, the Bylaws of the Company or
                 applicable law, any Board Action or Arbitration
                 (as defined in Section 3) that Indemnitee would
                 not be permitted to be indemnified in accordance
                 with Section 2(a) of this Agreement shall not be
                 binding.  If there has been no Board Action or
                 Arbitration, or if Board Action or Arbitration
                 determines that Indemnitee would not be
                 permitted to be indemnified, in any respect, in
                 whole  or in part, in accordance with Section
                 2(a) of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall have
                 the right to commence litigation in the court
                 which is hearing the action or proceeding
                 relating to the Claim for which indemnification
                 is sought or in any court in the States of
                 Delaware or Texas having subject matter
                 jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is
                 proper seeking an initial determination by the
                 court or challenging any such Board Action or
                 Arbitration or any aspect thereof, and the
                 Company thereby consents to service of process
                 and to appear in any such proceeding.  Any Board
                 Action not followed by Arbitration or such
                 litigation, and any Arbitration not followed by
                 such litigation, shall be conclusive and binding
                 on the Company and Indemnitee.

            3.   Change in Control.  The Company agrees that if
                 -----------------
            there is a Change in Control, Indemnitee, by giving
            written notice to the Company and the American
            Arbitration Association (the "Notice"), may require
            that any controversy or claim arising out of or
            relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof,
            shall be settled by arbitration (the "Arbitration"),
            in Fort Worth, Texas, in accordance with the Rules of
            the American Arbitration Association (the "Rules").
            The Arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of
            three arbitrators selected in accordance with the
            Rules within thirty days of delivery of the Notice.
            The decision of the panel shall be made as soon as
            practicable after the panel has been selected, and
            the parties agree to use their reasonable efforts to
            cause the panel to deliver its decision within ninety
            days of its selection.  The Company shall pay all
            fees and expenses of the Arbitration.  The
            Arbitration shall be conclusive and binding on the
            Company and Indemnitee, and Indemnitee may cause
            judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators
            to be entered in any court having jurisdiction
            thereof; provided, however, that any Arbitration
            shall have no effect on Indemnitee's right to
            commence litigation pursuant to Section 2(c) of this
            Agreement, in which case, such Arbitration shall not
            be conclusive and binding on Indemnitee or the
            Company.

            4.   Establishment of Trust.  In the event of a
                 ----------------------
            Potential Change in Control or a Change in Control,
            the Company shall, promptly upon written request by
            Indemnitee, create a Trust for the benefit of
            Indemnitee and from time to time, upon written
            request of Indemnitee to the Company, shall fund such
            Trust in an amount, as set forth in such request,
            sufficient to satisfy any and all Expenses reasonably
            anticipated at the time of each such request to be
            incurred in connection with investigating, preparing
            for and defending any claim relating to an
            Indemnifiable Event, and any and all judgements,
            fines, penalties and settlement amounts of any and
            all claims relating to an Indemnifiable Event from
            time to time actually paid or claimed, reasonably
            anticipated or proposed to be paid.  The terms of the
            Trust shall provide that upon a Change in Control (i)
            the Trust shall not be revoked or the principal
            thereof invaded, without the written consent of
            Indemnitee; (ii) the Trustee shall advance, within
            two business days of a request by Indemnitee, any and
            all Expenses to Indemnitee, not advanced directly by
            the Company to Indemnitee (and Indemnitee hereby
            agrees to reimburse the Trust under the circumstances
            under which Indemnitee would be required to reimburse
            the Company under Section 2(b) of this Agreement);
            (iii)  the Trust shall continue be to funded by the
            Company in accordance with the funding obligation set
            forth above; (iv)  the Trustee shall promptly pay to
            Indemnitee all amounts for which Indemnitee shall be
            entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
            Agreement or otherwise; and (v) all unexpended funds
            in such Trust shall revert to the Company upon a
            final determination by Board Action or Arbitration or
            a court of competent jurisdiction, as the case may
            be, that Indemnitee has been fully indemnified under
            the terms of this Agreement.  The Trustee shall be
            chosen by Indemnitee.  Nothing in this Section 4
            shall relieve the Company of any of its obligations
            under this Agreement.

            5.   Indemnification for Additional Expenses.  The
                 ---------------------------------------
            Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and
            all expenses (including attorney's fees) and, if
            requested by Indemnitee, shall (within two business
            days of such request) advance such expenses to
            Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in
            connection with any claim asserted by or action
            brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or
            advance payment of Expenses by the Company under this
            Agreement or any other agreement or Company Bylaw now
            or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for
            Indemnifiable Events and/or (ii) recovery under any
            directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
            maintained by the Company, regardless of whether
            Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to
            such indemnification, advance expense payment or
            insurance recovery, as the case may be.

            6.   Partial Indemnity, Etc.  If Indemnitee is
                 ----------------------
            entitled, under any provisions of this Agreement to
            indemnification by the Company for some or a portion
            of the Expenses, judgements, fines, penalties, excise
            taxes and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement of
            a Claim but not, however, for all of the total amount
            thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify
            Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which
            Indemnitee is entitled.  Moreover, notwithstanding
            any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent
            that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or
            otherwise in defense of any or all Claims relating in
            whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in
            defense of any issue or matter therein, including,
            without limitation, dismissal without prejudice,
            Indemnitee shall be indemnified against any and all
            Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes
            and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement of such
            Claim.  In connection with any determination by Board
            Action, Arbitration or a court of competent
            jurisdiction that Indemnitee is not entitled to be
            indemnified hereunder, the burden of proof shall be
            on the Company to establish that Indemnitee is not so
            entitled.

            7.   No Presumption.  For purposes of this Agreement,
                 --------------
            the termination of any claim, action, suit or
            proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether
            with or without court approval) or conviction, or
            upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent,
            shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did
            not meet any particular standard of conduct or have
            any particular belief or that a court has determined
            that indemnification is not permitted by applicable
            law or this Agreement.

            8.   Contribution.  In the event that the
                 ------------
            indemnification provided for in this Agreement is
            unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever,
            the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee,
            shall contribute to the amount incurred by
            Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties,
            excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in
            settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection
            with any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event, in
            such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in
            light of all of the circumstances of such action by
            Board Action or Arbitration or by the court before
            which such action was brought in order to reflect (i)
            the relative benefits received by the Company and
            Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or
            transactions(s) giving cause to such action; and/or
            (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its other
            directors, officers, employees and agents) and
            Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or
            transaction(s).  Indemnitee's right to contribution
            under this Paragraph 8 shall be determined in
            accordance with, pursuant to and in the same manner
            as, the provisions in Paragraphs 2 and 3 hereof
            relating to Indemnitee's right to indemnification
            under this Agreement.

            9.   Notice to the Company by Indemnitee.  Indemnitee
                 -----------------------------------
            agrees to promptly notify the Company in writing upon
            being served with or having actual knowledge of any
            citation, summons, complaint, indictment or any other
            similar document relating to any action which may
            result in a claim of indemnification or contribution
            hereunder.

            10.  Non-exclusivity, Etc.  The rights of the
                 --------------------
            Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any
            other rights Indemnitee may have under the Company's
            Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or the
            Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise, and
            nothing herein shall be deemed to diminish or
            otherwise restrict Indemnitee's right to
            indemnification under any such other provision.  To
            the extent applicable law or the Certificate of
            Incorporation or the Bylaws of Company, as in effect
            on the date hereof or at any time in the future,
            permit greater indemnification than as provided for
            in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that
            Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater
            benefits so afforded by such law or provision of the
            Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws and this
            Agreement shall be deemed amended without any further
            action by the Company or Indemnitee to grant such
            greater benefits.  Indemnitee may elect to have
            Indemnitee's rights hereunder interpreted on the
            basis of applicable law in effect at the time of
            execution of this Agreement, at the time of the
            occurrence of the Indemnifiable Event giving rise to
            a Claim or at the time indemnification is sought.

            11.  Liability Insurance.  To the extent the Company
                 -------------------
            maintains at any time an insurance policy or policies
            providing directors' and officers' liability
            insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy
            or policies, in accordance with its or their terms,
            to the maximum extent of the coverage available for
            any other Company director or officer under such
            insurance policy.  The purchase and maintenance of
            such insurance shall not in any way limit or affect
            the rights and obligations of the parties hereto, and
            the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall
            not in any way be construed to limit or affect the
            rights and obligations of the Company and/or of the
            other parties under any such insurance policy.

            12.  Period of Limitations.  No legal action shall be
                 ---------------------
            brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by
            or on behalf of the Company or any affiliate of the
            Company against Indemnitee, Indemnitee's spouse,
            heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives
            after the expiration of two years from the date of
            accrual of such cause of action, and any claim or
            cause of action of the Company or its affiliate shall
            be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted
            by the timely filing of a legal action within such
            two-year period; provided, however, that if any
                             --------  -------
            shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable
            to any such cause of action such shorter period shall
            govern.

            13.  Amendments, Etc.  No supplement, modification or
                 ----------------
            amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless
            executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.
            No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
            shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any
            other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor
            shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

            14.  Subrogation.  In the event of payment under this
                 -----------
            Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the
            extent of such payment to all of the rights of
            recovery with respect to such payment of Indemnitee,
            who shall execute all papers required and shall do
            everything that may be necessary to secure such
            rights, including the execution of such documents
            necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring
            suit to enforce such rights.

            15.  No-Duplication of Payments.  The Company shall
                 --------------------------
            not be liable under this Agreement to make any
            payment in connection with any claim made against
            Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise
            actually received payment (under any insurance
            policy, Bylaw or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise
            indemnifiable hereunder.

            16.  Binding Effect, Etc.  This Agreement shall be
                 --------------------
            binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be
            enforceable against and by the parties hereto and
            their respective successors, assigns (including any
            direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger,
            consolidation or otherwise to all of substantially
            all of the business and/or assets of the Company),
            spouses, heirs and personal and legal
            representatives.  The Company shall require and cause
            any successor (whether direct or indirect by
            purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all,
            substantially all, or a substantial part of the
            business and/or assets of the Company, by written
            agreement in form and substance satisfactory to
            Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform
            this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
            extent that the Company would be required to perform
            if no such succession had taken place.  This
            Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of
            whether Indemnitee continues to serve as a director
            and/or officer of the Company or of any other
            enterprise at the Company's request.

            17.  Severability.  The provisions of this Agreement
                 ------------
            shall be severable in the event that any of the
            provisions thereof (including any provision within a
            single section, paragraph or sentence) are held by a
            court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void
            or otherwise unenforceable, and the remaining
            provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest
            extent permitted by law.

            18.  Notices.  All notices, requests, demands and
                 -------
            other communications required or permitted hereunder
            shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
            duly given when delivered by hand or when mailed by
            certified registered mail, return receipt requested,
            with postage prepaid:

                 Company shall furnish to Indemnitee in
                 writing pursuant to the above.

            19.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed
                 -------------
            by and construed and enforced in accordance with the
            laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
            made and to be performed in such State without giving
            effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.

    (a) This calculation is submitted in accordance with Regulation S-K, Item 601(b)(11) although not required by
        footnote 2 to paragraph 14 of APB Opinion No. 15 because it results in dilution of less than 3%.
    (b) The amount in 1995 represents the pro rata portion of the Series C preferred stock outstanding prior to their
        conversion effective March 10, 1995.
    (c) For the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1993, these items are antidilutive and thus are omitted from the calculation.
