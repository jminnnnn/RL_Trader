                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL
   Tandy Corporation, a Delaware corporation,  was incorporated in 1967 ("Tandy"
or  the  "Company").  The  Company  engages  in  the  retail  sale  of  consumer
electronics  including personal computers primarily in the United States.  Sales
derived outside of the United States are not material.  The Company's  principal
retail operations include the RadioShack(R) and Computer City(R) store chains.

         RadioShack.RadioShack is the Company's largest operating business unit.
      At December 31, 1997, the RadioShack division operated 4,972 company-owned
      stores  located  throughout  the  United  States.   These  stores  average
      approximately  2,200  square  feet in gross area and are  located in major
      malls,  strip centers and individual store fronts.  RadioShack had, on the
      same  date,  a network  of 1,934  dealer/franchise  stores.  These  stores
      provide  RadioShack  products  to smaller  communities.  The  dealers  are
      generally  engaged in other retail operations and augment their sales with
      RadioShack  products.  This network included 59  international  dealers at
      December 31, 1997. RadioShack plans to expand its company-owned store base
      to exceed 5,000 locations by the end of 1998.

         The  company-owned  RadioShack  stores  carry  a  broad  assortment  of
      primarily  private label  electronic  parts and  accessories,  audio/video
      equipment,  digital  satellite  systems,  personal  computers  and related
      products  and  cellular,  PCS  and  conventional  telephones,  as  well as
      specialized  products such as scanners,  electronic toys and  hard-to-find
      batteries.  Personal  computers  and related  products,  which account for
      approximately  10% of RadioShack's  sales,  primarily  target family users
      seeking  computers  for home,  and small  business  use.  RadioShack  also
      provides  consumers access to third party services such as cellular phone,
      PCS, direct  satellite  programming and pager service.  RadioShack is also
      focusing   on   becoming   "America's   Telephone   Store"   through   its
      "store-within-a-store" concept where customers have access to wireless and
      residential  telephones and related telephony  products and services.  See
      "Net Sales and Operating Revenues" in Item 7 "Management's  Discussion and
      Analysis  of  Results  of  Operations  and  Financial   Condition"  for  a
      discussion of RadioShack's telecommunications alliance.

          On February 25, 1998, the Company, through its RadioShack division, 
      signed an exclusive multi-year retail sales and service agreement with
      Compaq Computer Corporation ("Compaq").  Under the agreement, Compaq will
      replace IBM as the sole  supplier of computers  sold  through all of 
      RadioShack's company-owned stores and those RadioShack's dealer/franchise 
      outlets which elect to participate.

         Computer City. The Company owns 80.1% of the  outstanding  common stock
      of Computer City, Inc. ("CCI" or "Computer City").  See "New Computer City
      Strategy"  below for a discussion  of the  Company's  strategy  concerning
      Computer City. As of December 31, 1997, there were 96 Computer City stores
      open,  including  seven in Canada.  Operating  primarily as a  supercenter
      format,  the average  store size is  approximately  21,050  square feet in
      gross area. CCI management plans to open 15-20 new stores in 1998.

         Computer  City offers  thousands  of  products  in  its   merchandising
      assortment,  including personal computer hardware and software and related
      products  and  accessories  from  vendors  such  as  IBM,  Compaq,  Canon,
      Hewlett-Packard,  Epson, Sony, Toshiba, Microsoft, Intuit, Western Digital
      and US Robotics. To complement its hardware and software sales and provide
      a total solution to the customer,  Computer City also offers services such
      as classroom and on-site training for widely-used  software  applications.
      Additionally,  service  centers are located within each of the 89 Computer
      City stores in the U.S.  and offer such  services as repair,  maintenance,
      custom  configuration,  diagnostic  testing,  computer  upgrades and other
      technical services on all major brands of computers and related products.

         In addition to its strong  retail  presence,  Computer  City also sells
      directly to corporate,  government and education customers through a sales
      force of national account managers located at each store.

         Incredible Universe. In December 1996, the Company announced its intent
      to exit the Incredible Universe business. All Incredible Universe stores
      were closed or sold in 1997. See "Provision for Business Restructuring" in
      Item 7  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Results of  Operations
      and Financial Condition" for further discussion.

   Supporting  the  retail  operations  is  an  extensive   infrastructure  that
includes:

         A&A  International, Inc. ("A&A") - This wholly-owned  subsidiary of the
      Company serves the  wide-ranging  international  import/export,  sourcing,
      evaluation,  logistics and quality control needs of the Company.  A&A also
      provides  services  for  outside  customers,   primarily  InterTAN,   Inc.
      ("InterTAN").  Most of A&A's  activity for InterTAN  involves  sourcing of
      goods from  manufacturers in Asia. See "Relations with InterTAN" in Item 7
      "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Results  of  Operations  and
      Financial Condition" for more discussion.

         Tandy  Service Centers - The Company maintains  a service  and support
      network to service the consumer  electronics and personal computer retail
      industry in the U.S. At December  31, 1997,  there were 52 Tandy  Service
      Centers in the U.S.  which repair  name-brand  and private label products
      sold through the Company's retail  distribution  channels.  These centers
      are also the primary  support for The Repair Shop at RadioShack  program.
      The Company is a  vendor-authorized  service  provider  for such  leading
      manufacturers  as  Compaq,  Sony,  Panasonic,  Hitachi,  Hewlett-Packard,
      RCA/Thomson  and Nokia,  among  others,  and also  performs  repairs  for
      third-party  service  centers and extended  service plan providers  under
      national service agreements.

         Regional Distribution Centers - The 13 distribution centers operated by
      the Company  ship over one  million  cartons  each month to the  Company's
      retail outlets.  Twelve of the 13 distribution  centers  primarily support
      RadioShack  retail  outlets and one cross  docking  distribution  facility
      supports both the Computer City and RadioShack store chains.

         Tandy Information Services ("TIS") - TIS collects  information from the
      retail stores  nationwide and updates large databases with sales and other
      information.  These databases are sophisticated marketing tools benefiting
      every phase of the Company's  operations.  TIS also  processes  inventory,
      accounting,  payroll,  telecommunications  and other operating information
      for all of the Company's operations. In addition,  specialized information
      is tracked for the Company's distribution and corporate activities.

         Tandy Credit Services - In March 1995, the Company completed the sale, 
      at net book value, of its private label consumer credit card  portfolio to
      Hurley State Bank,  a  subsidiary  of SPS  Transaction  Services,  Inc., a
      majority-owned  subsidiary of Dean Witter,  Discover and Company  ("SPS").
      The Company  still  makes  available  revolving  credit  payment  terms to
      RadioShack and Computer City consumers  through  private label credit card
      programs  provided by SPS. In  addition,  Tandy  Credit  Services  extends
      credit terms to qualified  corporate,  government and education customers,
      generally  pursuant  to  30-day  payment  terms.  The  Company  also has a
      third-party leasing program pursuant to which the Company refers corporate
      customers  desiring  financing  to an  independent  leasing  company  that
      purchases  the  specified  equipment  and  leases  it  directly  to  these
      customers.

         Tandy Transportation, Inc.  - A large fleet of  tractors  and  trailers
      transports  merchandise  from  manufacturers  or  ports  of  entry  to the
      Company's regional distribution centers and local distribution  facilities
      and also delivers to the Company's retail outlets.

         Tandy Customer Support  -  Using  state-of-the-art  telephone and  data
      networks,  Tandy Customer Support responds to more than five million calls
      annually for answers to technical  questions,  customer service inquiries,
      and direct sales for  RadioShack's  catalog  operations and "hard to find"
      products offered through its RadioShack Unlimited program.

         Consumer   Electronics   Manufacturing   -  The  Company operates nine
      manufacturing   facilities   in  the  United   States  and  one  overseas
      manufacturing  operation in China,  which is a joint  venture.  These ten
      manufacturing  facilities  cover a total  of  1,332,000  square  feet and
      employed approximately 3,100 workers and professionals as of December 31,
      1997.  The  Company  manufactures  a variety of  products  for use in its
      consumer electronics retailing operations.  These products include audio,
      video, telephony, antennas, wire and cable products and a wide variety of
      "hard  to find"  parts  for  consumer  electronic  products.  Most of the
      Company's  manufacturing  output is sold  through  the  RadioShack  store
      chain.

SEASONALITY
   As is the case with other  retail  businesses,  the  Company's  net sales and
other revenues are greater during the Christmas season than during other periods
of the year. There is a corresponding  pre-seasonal inventory build-up requiring
working capital associated with the anticipated increased sales volume. See Note
27 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for quarterly data.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
   Tandy owns or is licensed to use many  trademarks  related to its business in
the United States and in foreign countries.  Radio Shack,  RadioShack,  Computer
City,  and  Optimus  are some of the  registered  marks most  widely used by the
Company.  Tandy  believes that the  RadioShack and Computer City names and marks
are well-recognized by consumers,  and that these names and marks are associated
with high-quality  service providers.  The Company's  manufactured  products are
sold primarily under the RadioShack and Optimus  trademarks which are registered
in the U.S. and many foreign  countries.  The Company  believes that the loss of
the  RadioShack  and  Computer  City  names or marks  would be  material  to its
business,  but does not believe that the loss of any other  trademarks  would be
material.

   Tandy also owns various patents relating to retail and support  functions and
various   products  which  Tandy  has  previously   designed  and  continues  to
manufacture.

SUPPLIERS
   The Company obtains merchandise from a large number of suppliers from various
parts of the world. Alternative sources of supply exist for most merchandise and
raw  materials  purchased  by the  Company.  As the  Company's  product  line is
diverse,  the  Company  would not  expect a lack of  availability  of any single
product or raw material to have a material impact on its operations.  Management
does not believe that the loss of any one supplier would have a material  impact
on its operations.

BACKLOG ORDERS
   The Company has no material backlog of orders for the products it sells.

COMPETITION
   The consumer  electronics retail business remains highly competitive,  driven
by technology and product  cycles,  as well as the overall state of the economy.
In the consumer  electronics  retailing  business,  competitive  factors include
price, product quality, product features,  consumer services,  manufacturing and
distribution  capability and brand reputation.  The Company competes in the sale
of its products and services with department stores, mail order houses, discount
stores,  general  merchants  and gift  stores  which  sell  comparable  products
manufactured by others.  Competitors  range in size from local drug and hardware
stores  to large  chains  and  department  stores.  Computer  store  chains  and
franchise  groups,  as well as  independent  computer  stores and several  major
retailers, compete with the Company in the retail personal computer marketplace.
Consumer  electronics  and computer  mail-order  companies also compete with the
Company as do a number of competitors via on-line commerce on the Internet.  The
products  which  compete  with those sold by the  Company  are  manufactured  by
numerous  domestic  and  foreign  manufacturers.  Many of these  products  carry
nationally  recognized  brand  names or  private  labels and are sold in markets
common  to  the  Company.  Some  of the  Company's  competitors  have  financial
resources equal to or greater than the Company's resources.

   Management  believes  that many  factors  are  important  to its  competitive
position,   including  price,  quality,  service  and  the  broad  selection  of
electronic  products,   computers  and  computer  related  products  carried  at
conveniently  located  retail  outlets.  The  Company's  utilization  of trained
personnel  and its  ability  to use  national  and local  advertising  media are
important  to the  Company's  ability  to compete  in the  consumer  electronics
marketplace.  Management of the Company believes it is a strong  competitor with
respect to each of the factors  referenced above.  Given the highly  competitive
nature of the consumer  electronics  retail business,  no assurance can be given
that the Company will continue to compete  successfully  with respect to each of
the factors  referenced above.  Also, the Company would be adversely affected if
its  competitors  were to offer their  products at  significantly  lower prices,
introduce  innovative or technologically  superior products not yet available to
the Company or if the Company were unable to obtain  products in a timely manner
for an extended period of time.

   The Company focuses on two types of store formats to address the marketplace.
Each of the Company's retailing formats uses a distinct path to the marketplace,
based on its unique customer appeal, marketing strengths and margin structure:

          RadioShack:  RadioShack  stores offer  the  shopping   convenience  of
       approximately 6,900 company-owned and dealer stores which offer primarily
       private label high-quality products,  unique selection,  repair services,
       knowledgeable personnel, convenient credit options and excellent customer
       service, including its "service-oriented" approach. RadioShack has formed
       strategic  relationships  with key vendors in computers  (IBM in 1997 and
       Compaq  beginning in 1998),  direct-to-home  satellite  (RCA,  PrimeStar,
       DirecTV,   and   USSB),    telecommunications   (Sprint)   and   wireless
       communications  (Sprint PCS) to augment the strong  position  that it has
       historically  maintained  in core product  categories  such as batteries,
       communications equipment, telephones, antennas and electronic components,
       and parts and accessories.

          Computer City: Computer City stores  offer  over 4,000  different name
       brand  items,  competitive  prices  and  excellent  customer  service  on
       personal computer hardware and software as well as  accessories, printers
       and peripherals. This subsidiary operated 96 stores at December 31, 1997,
       which average approximately 21,050 square feet. Although retail sales are
       the  largest  component  of  Computer  City's  business,  its stores also
       fulfill other functions  including direct sales to corporate,  government
       and  education  customers  as well as  software  training  and  technical
       services.

   See  "Supplemental  Financial Data by Business Unit" in Item 7  "Management's
Discussion  and Analysis of Results of Operations  and Financial  Condition" for
net sales and operating revenues and operating profit (loss) by quarter for 1997
for RadioShack and Computer City.

EMPLOYEES
   As of December 31, 1997, the Company had approximately 44,000 employees. That
number includes  approximately 6,500 temporary retail employees which were hired
for the Christmas selling season. None of the Company's employees are covered by
collective   bargaining  agreements  nor  are  they  members  of  labor  unions.
Management of the Company  considers its  relationship  with its employees to be
good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
   Information on the Company's  properties is in  "Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Results of  Operations  and Financial  Condition"  and the financial
statements  included in this Form 10-K and is incorporated  herein by reference.
The following items are discussed further on the referenced pages:

                                                      Page
      Retail Outlets.........................          11
      Property, Plant and Equipment..........          46
      Leases.................................          49

   The  Company  leases,  rather  than  owns,  most  of its  retail  facilities.
RadioShack  and Computer  City stores are located  primarily  in major  shopping
malls, stand-alone buildings or shopping centers owned by other entities, except
that the land and building of one  Computer  City store is owned by the Company.
The Company owns most of the property on which its executive offices are located
in downtown Fort Worth, Texas, all distribution centers,  except for three which
are leased, and most of its manufacturing facilities and land located throughout
the  United  States.  A&A  International,   Inc.,  the  Company's  import/export
subsidiary,  leases eight  administrative  offices in the Asia  Pacific  region.
Existing  warehouse  and  office  facilities  are  deemed  adequate  to meet the
Company's needs in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
   Tandy  has  various   claims,   lawsuits,   disputes   with  third   parties,
investigations and pending actions involving allegations of negligence,  product
defects,  discrimination,  infringement of  intellectual  property  rights,  tax
deficiencies,  violations  of permits or  licenses,  and breach of contract  and
other matters against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the operation
of its business.  The liability,  if any,  associated with these matters was not
determinable  at December  31,  1997.  While  certain of these  matters  involve
substantial  amounts, and although occasional adverse settlements or resolutions
may occur and negatively  impact  earnings in the year of settlement,  it is the
opinion of management that their ultimate  resolution will not have a materially
adverse effect on Tandy's financial position.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
   No matters  were  submitted to a vote of security  holders  during the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 1997.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
        FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

   Tandy Corporation ("Tandy" or "Company") participates in a highly competitive
industry that is characterized by aggressive  pricing  practices.  In developing
strategies to achieve continued  increases in sales and operating  profits,  the
Company  anticipates  customer  demand  in  managing  its  product  transitions,
inventory levels, and distribution  cycles. Due to rapid technological  advances
affecting  personal  computer  and  consumer   electronic  product  cycles,  the
Company's  operating  results could be adversely  affected should the Company be
unable to  anticipate  product  cycle and/or  customer  demand  accurately.  The
Company's  ability to achieve  targeted sales and earnings levels depends upon a
number of competitive  and market factors  including,  without  limitation,  the
Company's  ability to open new stores in accordance with its plans,  real estate
market  fluctuations,  interest rate fluctuations,  dependence on manufacturers'
product  development and changes in tax rules and regulations  applicable to the
Company.

   The regulatory and trade environment in which the Company operates is subject
to risk and  uncertainty.  As a large importer of consumer  electronic  products
from Asia,  unfavorable trade imbalances or the failure of Congress to approve a
"Most Favored Nations" status to The People's Republic of China could negatively
affect  the  Company.  As a result of the  Telecommunications  Act of 1996,  the
deregulated   telecommunications   market   will   continue   to  present   both
opportunities and increased  competition for the provision of  telecommunication
equipment and service to consumers (see "Net Sales and Operating Revenues" for a
discussion of RadioShack's telecommunications alliance).

   With the exception of historical  information,  the matters  discussed herein
contain forward-looking  statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are
indicated  by  words  such as  "anticipates",  "expects",  "believes",  "plans",
"could", and similar words and phrases. These uncertainties include, but are not
limited to, economic conditions  including consumer  installment debt levels and
interest  rate  fluctuations,  shifts in  consumer  electronic  product  cycles,
technological  advances or a lack  thereof,  consumer  demand for  products  and
services,  competitive products and pricing, availability of products, inventory
risks due to shifts in market demand,  the regulatory and trade  environment and
other risks indicated in filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

STOCK SPLIT
    On August 21, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors  declared a two-for-one
split of Tandy common stock,  payable on September 22, 1997.  All  references to
the number of shares of common stock issued or  outstanding,  per share  prices,
cash  dividends and income per common share amounts in  Management's  Discussion
and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition have been adjusted
to reflect the split on a retroactive basis.

   Consolidated  net sales and operating  revenues  decreased  14.5% to $5,372.2
million in 1997 from  $6,285.5  million in 1996,  attributable  to Tandy's store
closure plan  announced in December  1996. For the year ended December 31, 1997,
the Company showed a 2.0% comparable store sales increase.

RadioShack
- ----------
   RadioShack's  overall sales for 1997 increased 3.7% to $3,215.7  million from
$3,101.1  million  in 1996,  adjusted  for  stores  closed  under the 1996 store
closure plan,  due to positive same store sales gains and the opening of 108 new
stores,  net of RadioShack store closures.  RadioShack's  comparable store sales
increase  was 1.9% for the year ended  December 31,  1997,  driven  primarily by
increased sales of wireless communication and telephone products (see below).

   Electronic parts,  accessories and specialty  equipment,  the largest product
category of RadioShack's sales mix, remained relatively  consistent in 1997 when
compared with the prior two years.

     The  communications  category  increased  to 27.5% of sales  from 24.4% and
24.5% in fiscal years 1996 and 1995, respectively. This category, which includes
wireless  communications  such  as  cellular  and  PCS  telephones  as  well  as
residential telephones,  answering machines,  pagers and other related telephony
products,  benefited  from  the  successful  rollout  of  the  Sprint  Store  at
RadioShack in September  1997. This program was initiated in September 1996 when
the Company, through its RadioShack division,  entered into a telecommunications
alliance  with Sprint  Communications  Company L.P.,  Sprint  United  Management
Company    (collectively,    "Sprint"),    and    Sprint    PCS.    Through    a
"store-within-a-store"  concept located in approximately 6,500 company-owned and
RadioShack   dealer   outlets,   customers   have  access  to  a  full   service
communications  information  center that offers,  where  available,  Sprint long
distance, local and wireless phone service,  Internet access and paging, as well
as SpreeSM  pre-paid  phone cards and phone  equipment.  RadioShack  is also the
exclusive   retailer  of   Sprint(R)   branded   residential   telephones.   The
communications  category is expected to continue to increase as a percentage  of
RadioShack's total sales in 1998.

   Sales of audio and  video  products  declined  to 16.8% of sales in 1997 from
18.0% and  18.1% in  fiscal  years  1996 and  1995,  respectively,  due to lower
consumer  demand for these  products  and the  heightened  level of  competition
within the industry.  Offsetting the decline in audio and video sales was a 7.0%
increase  in 1997 of  "direct-to-home"  system  sales,  despite a  substantially
reduced average selling price of digital satellite systems ("DSS").

   Personal  electronics  and seasonal  products  decreased to 11.6% of sales in
1997 from 12.4% and 13.1% in 1996 and 1995,  respectively,  due  primarily to an
overall  shift in the product mix to  communications;  management  expects  this
trend to continue in fiscal year 1998. The decreases  since 1995 are also due to
sales  declines in products  such as portable  radios,  boomboxes  and  cassette
products,  which are  indicative  of lower  general  consumer  demand  for these
products.

   Personal  computer sales  decreased as a percentage of total sales despite an
overall  unit gain for 1997.  The  average  1997  selling  price on desktop  and
notebook  computers  fell  17.8% and 7.7%,  respectively,  from the 1996  annual
average  selling  price.  On  January  28,  1998,  the  Company  announced  that
RadioShack  had  signed a letter of intent  for a  multi-year  retail  sales and
service  agreement with Compaq  Computer  Corporation  ("Compaq").  A definitive
agreement  was signed with Compaq on February  25, 1998.  Under this  agreement,
Compaq will replace IBM as the sole supplier of personal  computers sold through
RadioShack   retail   outlets.   Compaq   computers   will  be  marketed  via  a
"store-within-a-store"  concept similar to the Sprint Store at RadioShack.  Most
company-owned  stores and many of the RadioShack dealer/franchise outlets should
be retrofitted by the end of the third quarter of 1998.

   The repair services,  extended service contracts and other category increased
in 1997 due to an increase in residual income received from  RadioShack's  third
party providers of  communication  and  direct-to-home  products,  as well as an
increase in income from prepaid  cellular air time.  RadioShack  earns  residual
income  on sales of  Sprint  long  distance  services,  sales of  direct-to-home
programming and sales of many wireless products.  Additionally, RadioShack earns
commissions  from  cellular  carriers for  activating  customers  with  cellular
service.


Computer City
- -------------
   Computer  City,  Inc.'s  ("CCI  or  "Computer  City")  overall  sales in 1997
increased 10.6% to $1,903.7 million from $1,721.6 million in 1996,  adjusted for
the 21 stores closed  pursuant to the 1996 store closure plan.  Computer  City's
comparable  store sales increased 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 1997. The
overall sales increase was primarily  attributable  to positive same store sales
plus revenues generated by 14 new stores opened in 1996.

   In  stores  open at least  one  year,  sales of  personal  computers  were up
slightly in 1997 due to a  significant  increase in direct  sales to  corporate,
education and government customers.  This increase was offset by the decrease in
the  annual  average  selling  price of retail  desktop  computers,  which  fell
approximately  15.0% from the 1996 annual  average  selling  price.  To a lesser
extent,  a  decrease  in sales of non-DOS  machines  in 1997 also  impacted  the
personal  computers sales  increase.  Computer City is in the process of rolling
out a "build-to-order"  program,  which allows retail and corporate customers to
order a  custom-configured  personal  computer  and have it shipped  directly to
their home or office within a few days.

   Product  categories  which  experienced  sales  and  unit  increases  in 1997
included  scanners,  which  benefited  from both  lower  selling  prices and new
technology,  as well as notebook computers which experienced a large increase in
both sales dollars and unit sales.  Sales of software,  accessories and supplies
also  experienced  positive  sales growth in 1997 as Computer City continued its
focus on sales to experienced users.

   In stores open at least one year,  sales of extended  service plans increased
approximately  24.0% over the prior year,  attributable to Computer City's focus
on this area in 1997.  CCI  management  plans to  continue  its focus in 1998 on
sales of services,  including  extended  service  plans,  software  training and
technical support.

GROSS PROFIT

     Gross  profit for the Company was $2,014.3  million,  or 37.5% of net sales
and operating  revenues,  in fiscal 1997,  compared with  $2,022.4  million,  or
32.2%, in fiscal year 1996. This increase in gross profit as a percentage of net
sales and operating  revenues was primarily  due to  RadioShack  accounting  for
59.9% of the Company's  total sales and operating  revenues in fiscal year 1997,
compared to 49.3% in fiscal year 1996, which occurred as a result of the closure
of the Incredible  Universe  stores in early 1997 and, to a lesser  extent,  the
closure of 21 Computer City stores at December 31, 1996. Excluding stores in the
1996 closure plan and excluding the 1996 fourth  quarter lower of cost or market
inventory  impairment,  the slight decline in the Company's  gross profit margin
from  38.8% in 1996 to  38.4%  in 1997  resulted  primarily  from the fact  that
RadioShack's  1997  percentage  sales  increase  was less than  Computer  City's
percentage  sales increase.  Computer City has an inherently  lower gross margin
than RadioShack.

   RadioShack's  gross profit as a percentage  of total net sales and  operating
revenue increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 1997 versus 1996, due
to a positive shift within RadioShack's product offerings to increased cellular 
and telecommunication sales, as a percent of sales, and was further  enhanced by
decreased  sales of lower  margin  personal  computers  (see  table on "Class of
Products" above).

   Computer City's gross profit for continuing  stores as a percent of net sales
and operating  revenues increased 0.9 percentage points in 1997 when compared to
fiscal year 1996 due to improvement in inventory management,  increased sales of
higher margin  accessories  and software and an increase in the ratio of service
revenues to total  revenues.  Service  revenues  typically  have a higher  gross
margin than  merchandise  sales. CCI management will continue its focus in these
areas in 1998.

</TABLE>

   The Company's SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales and operating  revenues
increased for the year ended  December 31, 1997 to 29.4% from 28.0% for the year
ended  December  31,  1996.  The higher  SG&A  percentage  is due  primarily  to
RadioShack which became a larger percentage of Tandy's  consolidated  operations
during 1997 (see "Gross Profit" above).  RadioShack  operates at higher relative
SG&A levels than consolidated Tandy  Corporation.  Excluding those stores in the
1996 store closure plan,  SG&A as a percentage of sales would have  approximated
29.5%  for the year  ended  December  31,  1997.  See  "Provision  for  Business
Restructuring" below.

   Although  payroll and  commissions  expense for 1997  decreased in dollars in
comparison with 1996, this cost increased as a percentage of sales and operating
revenues from 12.1% in 1996 to 13.7% in 1997,  due to the increase in RadioShack
sales as a percentage of total sales and  operating  revenues  described  above.
RadioShack  has  inherently  higher  salary  expense  as  a  ratio of percent to
sales and  operating  revenues when  compared to the total  Company.  RadioShack
payroll expense  increased in dollars and as a percentage of RadioShack sales in
1997  from  1996 due to  increased  staffing  at the store  level.  This  dollar
increase  is  expected  to  continue  in 1998;  however,  payroll  expense  as a
percentage of sales is expected to remain  consistent  with 1997.  Computer City
payroll  expense as a percentage of Computer City sales  increased  from 1996 to
1997 due to the addition of new stores, added headcount in the direct sales area
and a realignment of support staff from Tandy Corporation to Computer City.

   Advertising  expense decreased,  both in dollars and as a percentage of sales
and operating  revenues,  in the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 1996. This decrease over the prior year is primarily the
result of reductions in Incredible  Universe  advertising  in 1997 due to stores
closed pursuant to the 1996 restructuring  plan. Computer City had a substantial
increase in vendor  participation in its advertising  campaigns in 1997 compared
to 1996.  Somewhat  offsetting  these  decreases was a slight dollar increase in
advertising  expense at RadioShack to promote the Sprint  "store-within-a-store"
concept, which was launched in September 1997. RadioShack advertising expense as
a percentage of sales in 1997 remained constant with 1996. In 1998,  advertising
dollars  are  expected  to be  comparable  to 1997,  with the  exception  of the
expenses associated with the prior year Sprint marketing launch.

   Rent expense  increased as a percentage of sales to 4.1% in 1997 from 3.8% in
1996.  This increase is related to a decrease in the number of Computer City and
Incredible  Universe  stores which have lower rent  expense as a  percentage  of
sales than the Company as a whole.  Rent  expense in dollars  decreased  in 1997
from 1996 due to Incredible  Universe and Computer City store closures  pursuant
to the 1996 restructuring  plan. Rent expense for RadioShack remained consistent
with the prior year in dollars and decreased  slightly as a percentage of sales.
Rent expense in dollars for RadioShack and Computer City is expected to increase
in 1998 due to new store openings.

   Fees paid for  promotional  accounts such as "zero  interest for six months",
which  are  classified  as  credit  card fees in the  accompanying  SG&A  table,
decreased  as a result of the  closure  of the  Incredible  Universe  stores and
decreased  usage by  RadioShack  during  1997.  Credit  card fees  expense  also
includes fees associated with third party bank credit cards.

   Other SG&A  expenses, which include  repair, maintenance, travel and returned
checks, as well as other miscellaneous expenses and other income, decreased both
as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues and in dollars when compared
to fiscal year ended December 31, 1996. Increases in other income were primarily
attributable to the receipt of $9.0 million,  pre-tax, of income from O'Sullivan
Industries (see "Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement Agreement" below) and
non-recurring gains of $4.7 million recorded on repayment of the note receivable
from InterTAN,  Inc. ("InterTAN") (see "Relations with InterTAN" below) and $3.0
million on sale of certain  assets.  These  increases  were offset by additional
restructuring expense of the $11.6 million related to store closings pursuant to
the 1996 store closure plan.

NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)

   The accompanying  table below summarizes the breakdown of interest income and
interest expense:

                                                   Year Ended

                                     ========        ========     =========

   Net interest expense was $32.9 million for 1997 versus $23.4 million in 1996.
Interest expense increased in 1997 as the Company continued  purchasing treasury
stock (see "Capital  Structure and Financial  Condition" below) and continued to
fund store  expansion.  Interest  expense  also  increased  during 1997 when the
Company refinanced existing short-term indebtedness (average maturity of 90 days
or less) by issuing $150.0 million of ten-year  unsecured notes,  resulting in a
moderately  higher interest rate when compared to the short-term  financing used
in 1996.

   Interest  income relating to the InterTAN notes decreased in 1997 as InterTAN
made the scheduled  principal payments on the note balances.  The remaining note
was repaid in December  1997 and, as such,  the Company  will no longer  receive
interest income from InterTAN in 1998 (see "Relations with InterTAN"  below). In
addition,  the  AST  Research,  Inc.  ("AST")  note  was  repaid  in  1996  and,
accordingly,  the Company no longer received interest income from this source in
1997  (see  "AST  Securities"  below).  Interest  income  relating  to the Fry's
Electronics,  Inc. and its affiliates  ("Fry's") notes receivables resulted from
the 1997 sale of assets and real estate of six Incredible  Universe  stores.  At
December 31, 1997,  the Company held  multiple  notes  receivable  from Fry's of
approximately  $75.3  million with varying  maturities  ranging from one to five
years and varying  interest rates ranging from  approximately  5.9% to 6.7%. The
Company expects interest income related to the Fry's notes to increase  slightly
during 1998 (see "Provision for Business Restructuring" below).

   Net interest expense is not expected to change  materially during 1998, based
on the existing interest rate environment.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

   The  provision  for income taxes  reflects an effective tax rate of 38.5% for
fiscal  year  1997,  compared  to an  effective  tax  benefit  of 37.1%  for the
comparable  period in fiscal  year 1996.  The  fiscal  1997  effective  tax rate
differed from the fiscal 1996  effective tax rate  primarily  because the fiscal
1996 tax rate  included  foreign  income  taxes  which were  incurred on foreign
income despite the overall loss incurred by the Company.

FISCAL 1996 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1995
- -------------------------------------
NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES

   Consolidated  net sales and  operating  revenues  increased  7.6% to $6,285.5
million  in 1996 from  $5,839.1  million in 1995.  The  increase  was  primarily
attributable to two factors:  (1) the addition of 111 RadioShack  stores (net of
closures)  and 14  Computer  City  stores  during  1996 and (2) the  incremental
addition of a full year's  revenue  related to stores  opened  during 1995 whose
total 1995 revenue reflected a partial year.

   For the year ended December 31, 1996,  the Company  showed a 2.3%  comparable
store  sales  decline,  which  was  the  result  of all  divisions  experiencing
comparable sales declines during the year.  Although RadioShack same store sales
declined less than 1%,  Incredible  Universe was down 4.2% and Computer City was
down 4.9%. These declines were indicative of the heightened level of competition
within the industry and lower  consumer  demand  which  negatively  impacted the
consumer  electronics  industry  as a whole.  This lower  demand  was  primarily
attributed  to higher  consumer  debt levels and the lack of new  products  with
significant technological advances.

RadioShack
- ----------
   RadioShack  sales for 1996 increased less than 2.0% to $3,101.1  million from
$3,044.1 million, adjusted for stores in the 1996 store closure plan. Electronic
parts,  accessories and specialty equipment,  including batteries,  remained the
single largest product category of RadioShack's  sales mix,  increasing to 30.9%
of sales  from  30.1% in 1995.  Communications  and  audio/video  sales  dollars
increased  slightly  in 1996,  while the  percentage  of total sales for each of
these  categories  remained  relatively   consistent  with  1995.  The  personal
electronics and seasonal  product  category,  which includes  portable radio and
cassette  products,  declined  as a  percentage  of  sales  from  1996 to  1995,
principally  due to lower  consumer  demand and  heightened  competition  in the
industry.

   The average 1996 selling price on desktop  computers  and notebook  computers
rose  32.9%  and  18.5%,  respectively,  over the 1995  average  selling  price,
contributing to the increase in the personal  computer  category as a percent of
total sales from 1995 to 1996.  This  increase in selling  price,  however,  was
offset by a decline in system units sold.  Repair  income  experienced  a slight
decline in 1996,  contributing  to the slight  decrease in the repair  services,
extended  service  contracts and other category as a percent of total sales from
1995 to 1996.

Computer City
- -------------
   Computer City sales in 1996 increased 22.7% to $1,721.6 million from $1,402.8
million in 1995,  adjusted for the stores  closed  under the 1996 store  closure
plan.  This  increase was the result of opening 30 new  Computer  City stores in
1995.  The 21 closed  Computer  City stores  announced  in the  Company's  store
closure plan in December 1996  generated  revenues of $359.1 million in 1996 and
$376.4 million in 1995.

Incredible Universe
- -------------------
   Incredible  Universe  sales  increased  22.4% to $908.5  million in 1996 from
$742.0 million in 1995. This increase was the result of opening eight new stores
in fiscal year 1995.

GROSS PROFIT

   Gross profit for the Company as a percentage of sales  declined from 35.5% in
1995 to 32.2% in 1996. The Company's  gross profit margin for 1996 was adversely
affected by  approximately  $91.4  million of lower of cost or market  inventory
writedowns  and  related  costs  primarily  associated  with  the  restructuring
announced in December 1996.  Excluding  these  charges,  the gross profit margin
would have been 33.6% for 1996.  The decrease in gross profit  margin from 35.5%
to 33.6% (as adjusted) reflected the effect of Tandy's lower gross margin retail
formats.  During  calendar  year 1996,  Computer  City and  Incredible  Universe
represented  47.6% of net sales and  operating  revenues as compared to 43.2% of
the 1995 net sales and operating revenues.  Continuing Computer City sales would
have  approximated  35.3% of 1996 total sales,  after giving  effect to the 1996
store closure plan. Furthermore,  the Company's gross profit margin for calendar
year 1996,  excluding  stores in the closure  plan and the 1996  fourth  quarter
lower of cost or market inventory impairment, would have approximated 38.8%. See
"Provision for Business Restructuring" below.

   During 1996,  RadioShack's gross margin was up slightly when compared to 1995
due to the relative  stability of product mix as a percentage  of overall  sales
from 1995 to 1996. Excluding lower of cost or market writedowns  associated with
store closures,  Computer City's gross margin decreased  slightly in 1996 due to
competitive forces which existed in the computer retail industry and the lack of
introduction in 1996 of new products with significant technological advances.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

   The Company's  SG&A, as a percentage of sales and operating  revenues for the
year ended  December 31,  1996,  declined to 28.0% from 28.2% for the year ended
December 31, 1995. The lower SG&A percentage reflected the lower costs, relative
to net sales and operating revenues,  of Computer City and Incredible  Universe,
which  operate at lower  relative  costs than  consolidated  Tandy  Corporation.
Excluding  those stores in the 1996 store closure plan,  SG&A as a percentage of
sales would have approximated 29.7% versus 28.0% for the year ended December 31,
1996. See "Provision for Business Restructuring" below.

   Payroll  and  commissions  expense  remained   relatively   consistent  as  a
percentage of net sales and operating  revenues  between 12.1% in 1996 and 12.0%
in  1995.  As of  December  31,  1996,  the  Company  had  approximately  48,400
employees,  which included  approximately  8,500 temporary  retail employees who
were hired for the Christmas selling season.

   Advertising  costs  for 1996  decreased  as a  percentage  of net  sales  and
operating  revenue  to 4.1%  from  4.4%  due to  nonrecurring  1995  promotional
expenses  relating  to the grand  opening of 30  Computer  City stores and eight
Incredible Universe stores during 1995. RadioShack's 1996 advertising expense as
a percentage of sales remained consistent with 1995.

   Rent expense increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 3.8% in 1996 from
3.7% in 1995 due to the increase in the number of Computer  City and  Incredible
Universe stores over the prior year.

   The 1996  expenses  of the credit  operations  were  eliminated  in 1996 as a
result of the sale of the private label credit card portfolios.  The sale of the
portfolio also impacted  interest income (see discussion  below).  Commencing in
1995, the Company  receives fees from an unrelated  third party financier of its
private  label  credit  card  portfolio  balance  for the  generation  of normal
interest-bearing  accounts, and pays a fee for the generation of special purpose
promotional  accounts,  such  as  "zero  interest  for six  months".  Incredible
Universe and Computer City utilized these  promotions  frequently in fiscal 1996
and the fees are classified as credit card fees in the  accompanying  SG&A table
above.

   Other SG&A expenses,  which include repair,  maintenance,  travel,  and other
miscellaneous  expenses had, in total,  remained  relatively  consistent between
3.1% and 3.0% of sales during 1996 and 1995.

NET INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE)

   Net interest expense was $23.4 million for 1996 versus net interest income of
$8.6 million for 1995. The reversal to a net interest  expense  position in 1996
was primarily  attributable  to the sale of the  Company's  private label credit
card  portfolios  to a third  party in the fourth  quarter of 1994 and the first
quarter of 1995 (see "Sale of Credit Operations" below for further information).

   Interest  expense  grew  from  1995  to  1996 as a  result  of the  Company's
increased  usage of short-term  borrowing  facilities,  including  seasonal bank
credit lines and commercial paper facilities, as excess funds from the 1995 sale
of credit operations were fully utilized. The use of these facilities was higher
during  1996 as the  Company  continued  to retire  long-term  debt,  fund store
expansion and execute the share repurchase program.

   Interest  income relating to the InterTAN notes and the AST note decreased in
1996 as  scheduled  principal  payments  were  received  by the  Company.  Other
interest  income  relates  primarily to cash  equivalents of the Company and was
higher in 1995 than in 1996 due to increased cash equivalents resulting from the
sale of the credit card portfolios.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

   The  effective  tax benefit rate that  resulted  from the  Company's net loss
position  was  37.1% for the year  ended  December  31,  1996,  compared  to the
effective tax rate of 38.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1995. The effective
tax rate for 1996 changed from 1995 due primarily to foreign  income taxes which
were incurred on foreign income in 1996 despite the overall loss incurred by the
Company.

NEW COMPUTER CITY STRATEGY
   On June 26, 1997, the Company organized a new subsidiary, CCI, and thereafter
conveyed to it certain related assets and liabilities of the Company's  Computer
City  division.  On July 17,  1997,  Eureka  Venture  Partners  III LLP, a Texas
limited  liability  partnership  ("Eureka"),   entered  into  a  Stock  Purchase
Agreement with the Company (the "Stock Purchase  Agreement") to acquire 19.9% of
the outstanding common stock of CCI for a total purchase price of $24.9 million,
payable  in cash (1% of the  purchase  price)  and a note  (99% of the  purchase
price)  issued by Eureka.  The note is secured only by the common  shares of CCI
held by Eureka. Accordingly,  this transaction has not been recognized as a sale
for accounting purposes and Tandy continues to consolidate 100% of CCI's results
of  operations.  The note bears  interest at 8.0% per annum and is payable on or
before July 17,  2002.  Pursuant to the terms of the Stock  Purchase  Agreement,
Eureka and its principals  provided a new senior  management  team for CCI. This
new management team consists of Nathan Morton,  CCI Chief Executive  Officer and
Co-Chairman,  Avery  More,  CCI Vice  Chairman,  and  Robert  Boutin,  CCI Chief
Financial  Officer,  all of whom are  principals of Eureka.  John V. Roach,  the
Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of the  Company,  serves  as the other
Co-Chairman of CCI and as its President. Eureka, on July 17, 1997, also acquired
a warrant to purchase an additional 20.1% of the outstanding common stock of CCI
for $31.4  million  payable in cash (at least 10% of the  purchase  price) and a
note (not more than 90% of the purchase price) issued by Eureka. This warrant is
exercisable upon either the attainment of certain financial performance goals by
CCI or upon the date CCI is  established  as an  independent  entity as  defined
pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement.

     In  connection  with the creation of CCI, the Company  assigned to CCI, and
CCI assumed, the Company's  obligations under a $125.0 million subordinated note
payable  bearing  8.0%  interest.  The note is due in July  2002 to Trans  World
Electronics,  Inc., a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Tandy.  This subordinated note
represents  certain  liabilities  of the Company  allocable to its Computer City
division that were assumed by CCI.  Computer City currently has a $150.0 million
bank line of credit of which $30.0 million is  outstanding at December 31, 1997.
This line of credit is fully  guaranteed by Tandy through December 31, 1998 (see
Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements").  CCI will use the
line of credit primarily for internal working capital  requirements.  In January
1998,  CCI also began  working  with two  investment  banks to raise  additional
equity as a part of a strategy for CCI to reach independent status. There can be
no assurance, however, that any such independence will occur.

   Eureka has the option to require the Company to  repurchase  all shares owned
by Eureka and the warrant in the event that it is exercisable  but  unexercised,
upon payment of certain amounts, as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement, if
certain  financial  performance  goals  are  met by CCI and  the  CCI  Board  of
Directors does not approve the establishment of CCI as an independent  entity by
means of one or more transactions.  Additionally, prior to CCI being established
as an  independent  entity,  the Company has the right to  reacquire  all of the
shares  of CCI  owned  by  Eureka,  and  the  warrant  in the  event  that it is
exercisable, but unexercised,  upon payment of certain amounts, as determined by
defined formulas pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement.

   Sales and operating  revenues,  operating losses, and restructuring and other
charges  (before  interest  and taxes) for CCI for each of the three years ended
December 31 are presented below:

                                          1997          1996          1995
                                        --------      --------      --------
  Sales and operating revenues          $1,903.7      $2,080.5      $1,779.2
  Operating loss                           (14.9)        (47.2)        (20.3)
  Restructuring and other charges             --         (54.2)           --
   
   As described  more fully in  "Provision  for Business  Restructuring"  below,
during the fourth quarter of 1996 Tandy elected to close 21 unprofitable stores.
CCI  recognized  a  pre-tax   restructuring  charge  aggregating  $14.8  million
associated  with  these  closings.   The  charges  related  primarily  to  lease
obligations and employee termination  expenses.  CCI also recognized  impairment
charges  pursuant  to  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of" ("FAS 121")  aggregating  $18.7 million during 1996 and lower of
cost or market impairments  aggregating  approximately  $20.7 million related to
inventory  liquidated at the affected stores.  Additionally,  the new management
team at CCI has taken and will  continue  to take  certain  actions to  increase
revenues and achieve  profitability.  These actions include  increasing  service
revenues  which  typically  have a higher gross margin than  merchandise  sales,
increasing  direct sales to  corporations,  government and education  customers,
creating   a   build-to-order   program   which   allows   customers   to  order
custom-configured  personal  computers,  and  developing the ability to purchase
products  on-line via the  Internet.  Management  of CCI and Tandy  believe that
these actions will result in improved operating performance;  however, there can
be no assurance that increased sales and profitability will be achieved.  Should
these actions fail to increase sales and achieve  operating  profit,  management
may be required to close  additional  stores,  sell certain assets or take other
measures deemed necessary to achieve improved operating performance.

PROVISION FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING
   In  1996,  Tandy  initiated  certain  restructuring  programs  affecting  its
Incredible  Universe and  Computer  City stores and its  remaining  McDuff store
operations.  These  restructuring  programs  were  undertaken as a result of the
highly competitive  environment in the electronics  industry.  The components of
the restructuring charge and an analysis of the reserves are outlined in a table
in Note 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".

   The  Company  recorded a pre-tax  charge of $25.5  million  during the second
quarter  of  1996  related  to  an  Incredible  Universe  restructuring  program
announced in May 1996. The charge related primarily to future lease obligations,
disposition  of fixed assets,  and certain  termination  costs  associated  with
employees.  This program included an overhead reduction plan, the closing of two
stores  in the  second  quarter  of 1996 due to  inadequate  sales  volumes  and
non-recoverable costs incurred with certain real estate sites held for new store
development.  The Company also recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136.6
million in the fourth quarter of 1996 related to the closing of the remaining 53
McDuff  stores,  exiting the  Incredible  Universe  business  (consisting  of 17
remaining open stores), and the closure of 21 unprofitable Computer City stores.
The fourth quarter charges related primarily to lease  obligations,  real estate
costs,  employee  termination  expenses  and  contract  cancellation  costs.  In
association  with  the 1996  restructurings,  the  Company  also  recognized  an
impairment  charge of $112.8 million pursuant to FAS 121 (see discussion  below)
and lower of cost or market impairments aggregating  approximately $91.4 million
primarily  related to inventory  that was  liquidated  at the  affected  stores.
Inventory  impairment charges were recognized in the Consolidated  Statements of
Income as an increase in cost of sales in 1996 (see  "Gross  Profit"  discussion
above).

   In January 1997,  the Company closed the respective 53 McDuff and 21 Computer
City stores.  The sale of the real estate of six Incredible  Universe stores and
related  fixed  assets and  inventory  to Fry's was  concluded  in July 1997 for
approximately  $21.5 million in cash and $97.4 million in notes  receivable with
no material gain or loss  recognized  upon the sale.  At December 31, 1997,  the
notes  receivable  balance was $75.3  million.  The interest  rates on the notes
range from  approximately 5.9% to 6.7% with maturity dates ranging from one year
to five years. The sales of seven additional  Incredible Universe locations were
completed  during  July  and  August  1997 for  $81.2  million  in  cash,  notes
receivable and marketable  securities,  the securities  having been subsequently
sold for cash.  Again,  no material gain or loss was recognized upon the sale of
the assets. The note receivable  approximated $0.9 million at December 31, 1997.
The lease was terminated on another  location during the fourth quarter of 1997,
leaving five locations remaining at December 31, 1997.

   As of March 18,  1998,  signed  agreements  existed to sell the  building and
leasehold  improvements  on  two  other  Incredible  Universe  locations  and to
sublease  the  land  at one of  these  locations,  subject  to  obtaining  final
approvals  and  permits.   Management   anticipates  that  the  three  remaining
Incredible  Universe locations will be sold,  subleased or the leases terminated
with the lessors by the third quarter of 1998, based on signed letters of intent
obtained by the Company and/or negotiations currently in process; however, there
can be no assurance  that such  planned  disposals  or lease  terminations  will
occur.

(1) The  operating  loss for 1997  excludes a reserve  estimate  recorded in the
    fourth  quarter of 1997 of an  additional  $11.6  million  relating to store
    closings  pursuant  to the  1996  store  closure  plan.  The  $11.6  million
    provision is included in selling,  general and administrative expense in the
    accompanying 1997 Consolidated Statements of Income.

   Although no significant  additional  provisions are expected in 1998 relating
to the 1996  restructuring,  unexpected  delays in the  closing  of real  estate
sales, among other factors,  may result in additional  charges.  Management does
not  anticipate  any  significant  revenue or operating loss in 1998 from stores
closed pursuant to the 1996 restructuring plan.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
   Upon adoption of FAS 121 in the first quarter of 1996, the Company recognized
an initial non-cash  impairment loss of  approximately  $26.0 million to conform
with this  statement,  primarily  as a result of grouping  long-lived  assets at
their  lowest level of cash flows to  determine  impairment  as required by this
statement.  Fair value was principally  determined  based upon estimated  future
discounted cash flows (before interest) related to each group of assets.

   The Company  recognized an  additional  non-cash  impairment  charge of $86.8
million  in the fourth  quarter of 1996  primarily  related to the  disposal  of
certain  long-lived assets pursuant to its restructuring plan (see Note 6 of the
"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").  These assets principally related
to the  Incredible  Universe,  Computer City and McDuff stores that were part of
the store  closure  plan,  and  certain  foreign  real  estate.  Fair  value was
principally determined by quoted market prices.

AST SECURITIES
   On July 12,  1996,  the  Company  received  $60.0  million  in cash and $30.0
million in AST common  stock as final  payment of a $90.0  million  note payable
from AST to the Company.  The Company's  original cost basis  approximated $6.67
per share.

   During the fourth quarter of 1996,  the Company  recognized a pre-tax loss of
$7.0 million on the stock because the decline in the price was  determined to be
other than temporary.  The $7.0 million loss was charged to selling, general and
administrative  expenses in the  accompanying  1996  Consolidated  Statements of
Income.

   During August 1997,  the Company sold the remaining  4,413,594  shares of AST
common  stock  under a tender  offer from  Samsung  for total  proceeds of $23.8
million.  A gain of $1.3  million  was  recognized  on the sale  which  has been
included as a reduction to SG&A expense in the  accompanying  1997  Consolidated
Statements of Income.

NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS
   In June 1997, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (the "FASB") issued
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income" ("FAS
130") and Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of
an  Enterprise  and Related  Information"  ("FAS 131"),  which are effective for
fiscal years  beginning  after December 15, 1997. The Company will adopt FAS 130
and FAS 131 in the first  quarter  of 1998.  Also,  the  American  Institute  of
Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 98-1,  "Accounting for
the Costs of Computer  Software  Developed or Obtained  for Internal  Use" ("SOP
98-1"),  which is effective for fiscal years  beginning after December 15, 1998.
The Company's current policy falls within the guidelines of SOP 98-1.

SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS
   In December 1994, the Company sold its Computer City and Incredible  Universe
private  label  credit card  portfolios  to SPS  Transaction  Services,  Inc., a
majority-owned  subsidiary of Dean Witter,  Discover and Company  ("SPS").  As a
result of the  transaction,  Tandy received cash of $85.8 million at the time of
the sale,  and a deferred  payment of $179.8  million  during 1995.  The Company
discounted  the  deferred   payment  by  5.0%  to  yield   interest   income  of
approximately $3.5 million over the twelve month payout period.

   On March 30, 1995, the Company  completed the sale, at net book value, of the
RadioShack  and  Tandy  Name  Brand  private  label  credit  card  accounts  and
substantially all related accounts receivable to Hurley State Bank, a subsidiary
of SPS. As a result of the  transaction,  Tandy received  $342.8 million in cash
and a  deferred  payment  of $49.4  million.  All of the  deferred  payment  was
received in 1995, except for $2.1 million, which was received in 1996.

TAX SHARING AND TAX BENEFIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
   Pursuant to the Company's Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement Agreement
(the "Agreement") with O'Sullivan Industries ("O'Sullivan"), a former subsidiary
of Tandy,  the Company  receives  payments  from  O'Sullivan  approximating  the
federal tax benefit that O'Sullivan realizes from the increased tax basis of its
assets  resulting from the initial public  offering  completed in February 1994.
The higher tax basis increases  O'Sullivan's  tax deductions  and,  accordingly,
reduces  income taxes payable by  O'Sullivan.  For the years ended  December 31,
1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company recognized income of $5.8 million, $0.2 million
and $1.3 million, net of tax, respectively, under this Agreement. These payments
will  continue  to be made over a 15-year  time period and are  contingent  upon
O'Sullivan's  level of earnings  from year to year.  The income is recorded as a
reduction of selling,  general and  administrative  expenses in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income.

CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY
                                          Year Ended
                                          December 31,
                             --------------------------------------
(In millions)                  1997           1996           1995
- -------------                --------       --------       --------
Operating activities         $  320.3       $  307.5       $  673.0
Investing activities            (63.9)        (112.9)        (180.3)
Financing activities           (272.0)        (216.6)        (554.8)

   Tandy's cash flow and liquidity,  in  management's  opinion,  remains strong.
During the year ended December 31, 1997,  cash provided by operations was $320.3
million as compared to $307.5  million for the year ended  December 31, 1996 and
$673.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1995.

   Cash flow  from  operations  before  working  capital  changes  increased  to
approximately $392.7 million in 1997 from $258.3 million in 1996 due to improved
operating  performance.  Working  capital  components used $72.4 million in cash
flow from  operations  in 1997,  due  primarily  to a decrease in other  current
liabilities  of  $209.6  million,  related,  for the  most  part,  to  resulting
expenditures   associated  with  the   restructuring   activity.   Substantially
offsetting the decreased cash flow from  expenditures  related to  restructuring
was a decrease in  inventory,  which  generated  $163.8  million in cash flow in
1997, of which $106.0 million  related to the liquidation of inventory at closed
Incredible Universe stores. Additionally, Computer City inventory decreased over
the prior  year due to better  inventory  management  and,  to a lesser  extent,
inventory  liquidations  at closed  Computer City stores.  RadioShack  inventory
increased  $37.7 million  compared to 1996 due primarily to increased  telephony
inventory--both PCS and residential hardware.

   In 1996, working capital components  generated $49.2 million of positive cash
flow to operations,  with current  liabilities  generating $38.1 million of this
increase.  In 1996,  inventory for  RadioShack  and related  support  operations
decreased  approximately $30.0 million,  while during the same period,  Computer
City and  Incredible  Universe  inventories  (prior to  restructuring  reserves)
increased approximately $30.1 million. These year-to-year inventory fluctuations
offset one  another,  resulting  in no material  net cash  effect for 1996.  The
increased cash flow from  operations for 1995 compared to 1996 was the result of
nonrecurring  cash flows generated in 1995 related to the cash received from the
sale of the credit card  portfolios,  which  approximated  $342.8  million,  and
collection of the deferred payment amount from SPS of $179.8 million.

   Investing  activities  used $63.9  million in cash flow in 1997  compared  to
$112.9 million in 1996 and $180.3  million in 1995,  primarily  attributable  to
reduced capital expenditures.  Capital expenditures  approximated $118.4 million
in 1997 as  compared  to $174.8  million  and  $226.5  million in 1996 and 1995,
respectively.  Capital  expenditures  for 1997 were used  primarily  for  retail
expansion and upgrading  information systems.  Capital expenditures for 1996 and
1995 were used primarily for retail expansion, upgrading information systems and
headquarter   building   renovations.   Management   anticipates   that  capital
expenditure  requirements  for 1998 will  approximate  $100.0 to $110.0 million,
excluding  Computer City, and will consist  primarily of RadioShack future store
expansions and refurbishments,  reconfiguration of selected distribution centers
and  updated  information  systems  as  well  as  other  miscellaneous   capital
expenditures.  These  expenditures  will be funded primarily from cash flow from
operations. CCI management anticipates capital expenditure requirements for 1998
to approximate $50.0 to $60.0 million, related primarily to information systems,
new store openings and store remodels.

   Investing  activities  also  included cash proceeds of $12.7 million from the
sale of plant,  property and equipment  related to the sale of various corporate
assets. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment in 1995 resulted
primarily  from  sale-leaseback  transactions  which  netted the  Company  $37.6
million in cash. In August 1997, the Company sold its remaining 4,413,594 shares
of AST common stock for approximately $23.8 million. The stock had been received
in 1996 as a partial  payment on a note receivable from AST. The cash portion of
payments on the AST note  receivable  amounted to $60.0 million in 1996 and $6.7
million in 1995.  In December  1997,  the Company  received  $20.9  million from
InterTAN  as  final  repayment  on its  note  receivable  (see  "Relations  with
InterTAN" below).

   Cash used by financing  activities  was $272.0  million in 1997,  compared to
$216.6 million and $554.8 million in 1995.  Purchases of treasury stock required
cash of $425.6  million,  $232.9  million and $502.2  million in 1997,  1996 and
1995,  respectively.  See "Capital Structure and Financial  Condition" below for
further information on the Company's stock repurchase program. Sales of treasury
stock to the Tandy Stock Plan generated cash of $35.2 million, $39.4 million and
$44.6 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Dividends paid, net of tax,
in 1997,  1996 and 1995  amounted  to $48.2  million,  $52.5  million  and $63.0
million,  respectively. As a result of the Company calling for the redemption of
its  $2.14  Depositary  Shares  of  the  Company's  Series  C  Preferred  Equity
Redemption Convertible Stock ("PERCS") in March 1995, the Company eliminated its
annual  dividend  payment  to the  PERCS  shareholders  of  approximately  $32.0
million.  The Company plans to fund common and Series B (Tandy  Employees  Stock
Ownership Plan,  "TESOP") preferred stock dividends with available cash and cash
flow from operations.

     In 1997, the Company  increased its short-term  debt over the prior year by
$43.6  million,  net of the  reduction  due to  utilization  of  $150.0  million
long-term debt to retire  short-term debt. The Company's  additional  short-term
debt  in 1997  was  used  for  general  working  capital  requirements,  capital
expenditures, the share repurchase program and the repayment of $28.5 million of
current  maturities on  outstanding  medium-term  notes.  The Company's  primary
source  of  short-term  debt,  for which  borrowings  and  repayments  have been
presented  net in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows,  consists  of
short-term  seasonal bank debt and commercial  paper,  which have  maturities of
less than 90 days. The Company increased its long-term debt by $149.8 million in
1997,  primarily  through the issuance of $150.0 million of long-term debt under
the Company's  $300.0  million Debt Shelf  Registration  Statement (see "Capital
Structure and Financial Condition" below). Proceeds from this offering were used
to  refinance  existing   short-term   indebtedness.   Repayments  of  long-term
borrowings during 1997 primarily  consisted of the repayment of $28.5 million of
medium-term notes.

   Following  are the  current  credit  ratings for Tandy,  which are  generally
considered investment grade:

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
   The Company's  balance sheet and financial  condition  continue to be strong.
The  Company's  available  borrowing  facilities  as of  December  31,  1997 are
detailed in Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".

   On March  3,  1997,  the  Company  announced  that  its  Board  of  Directors
authorized management to purchase an additional 10.0 million shares, as adjusted
to reflect the  two-for-one  split,  of its common stock  through the  Company's
existing share repurchase  program.  The share repurchase  program was initially
authorized in December 1995 and increased in October 1996 and was  undertaken as
a result of management's  view of the economic value of the Company's stock. The
share increase for 1997 brings the total authorization to 30.0 million shares of
which 21.0  million  shares  totaling  $529.2  million had been  purchased as of
December 31, 1997.  Approximately  11.9 million shares were  repurchased in 1997
for $333.1  million.  These purchases are in addition to the shares required for
employee plans which are purchased  throughout the year. Purchases will continue
to be made in 1998 in the open market,  but possibly to a lesser  extent than in
1997,  and it is expected that funding of the program will come from excess free
cash flow.

   The revolving credit backup facility to Tandy's  commercial paper program was
renewed  during the second  quarter of 1997.  This  facility  is composed of two
agreements:  a one-year  facility for $200.0  million  expiring  June 1998 and a
five-year  facility for $300.0 million expiring in June 2001.  Annual commitment
fees for the facilities  are 0.07% of the $200.0 million  facility per annum and
0.10% of the $300.0 million  facility per annum,  respectively,  whether used or
unused.

   The total  debt-to-capitalization ratio was 33.6% at December 31, 1997, 22.3%
at December  31,  1996 and 17.1% at  December  31,  1995.  This  increase in the
debt-to-capitalization  ratio in 1997 and 1996  results  primarily  from Tandy's
share repurchase program.

   On March 3, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the filing of a
$300.0 million Debt Shelf Registration Statement (the "Registration  Statement")
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("S.E.C.").  The Company filed the
Registration Statement with the S.E.C. in May 1997, which was declared effective
on August 6, 1997. On August 19, 1997,  the Company  issued $150.0 million of 10
year unsecured notes under the Registration Statement.  The interest rate on the
notes is 6.95% per annum with  interest  payable on  September  1 and March 1 of
each year, commencing on March 1, 1998. The notes are due September 1, 2007. The
proceeds were used to refinance existing short-term indebtedness.

   In December 1997, the Company issued $4.0 million in medium-term  notes under
the remaining $150.0 million of the Registration  Statement. An additional $45.0
million of medium-term  notes were issued in January 1998.  Tandy's  medium-term
notes  outstanding  at December  31, 1997 under the current and  previous  shelf
registrations  totaled $30.0  million  compared to $54.5 million at December 31,
1996. The interest rates at December 31, 1997 for the outstanding  $30.0 million
in  medium-term  notes  ranged from 6.31% to 8.63%,  with the  weighted  average
coupon rates being 8.2% and 8.5% at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

   Management  believes that the Company's present borrowing capacity is greater
than the established  credit lines and long-term debt in place.  Management also
believes that the Company's cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents
and its available  borrowing  facilities  are more than adequate to fund planned
store expansion,  to meet debt service and dividend requirements and to fund its
share repurchase program.

INFLATION
   Inflation  has not  significantly  impacted  the Company  over the past three
years.  Management  does not expect  inflation to have a  significant  impact on
operations in the  foreseeable  future unless  global  situations  substantially
affect the world economy.

RELATIONS WITH INTERTAN
   InterTAN,  the former  foreign  retail  operations of Tandy,  was spun off to
Tandy  stockholders  as a tax-free  dividend in fiscal 1987.  Summarized  in the
tables below are the notes and other  receivables  due from InterTAN at December
31, 1997 and 1996, as well as the income  components  generated from  operations
relative to InterTAN for each of the three years ended  December 31, 1997,  1996
and 1995.

   In August 1993, Trans World  Electronics,  Inc. ("Trans World"), a subsidiary
of  Tandy,  reached  an  agreement  with  InterTAN's  banking  syndicate  to buy
approximately  $42.0  million of  InterTAN's  debt at a  negotiated,  discounted
price. The debt purchased from the banks was restructured into a seven-year note
with  interest  of 8.64%  (the  "Series  A" note).  Trans  World  also  provided
approximately  $10.0  million in working  capital and trade  credit to InterTAN.
Interest  on the  working  capital  loan (the  "Series B" note) of 8.11% was due
semiannually  beginning  February  25,  1994  until the note was paid in full in
1996. On December 30, 1997,  InterTAN  repaid the gross amount of the "Series A"
note in full.  In  consideration  for the  extension of credit,  Trans World had
received  five-year warrants  exercisable for approximately  1,450,000 shares of
InterTAN  common stock.  The warrants were returned to InterTAN in December 1997
upon  repayment of the "Series A" note.  Due to the  repayment of the "Series A"
note in 1997,  the Company  will no longer  receive  interest  income or have an
accretion  of discount  from  InterTAN.  The Company  recognized  a gain of $4.7
million upon retirement of the "Series A" note.

   Under the terms of a merchandise  agreement  reached with InterTAN in October
1993, as amended, InterTAN may purchase, on payment terms, certain products sold
or secured by Tandy. A&A International,  Inc. ("A&A"), a subsidiary of Tandy, is
and will continue to be the exclusive  purchasing agent for products originating
in Asia for InterTAN.  A&A receives commission income for this service.  License
agreements,  as amended, also provide a royalty payable to Tandy, which began in
the September 1995 quarter.

YEAR 2000
   The Company's  management  recognizes  the need to ensure its  operations and
relationships  with  vendors  and  other  third  parties  will not be  adversely
impacted by software  processing errors arising from calculations using the year
2000 and beyond ("Year  2000").  Like many  companies,  a significant  number of
Tandy's computer applications and systems require modification over the next two
years in order to render these systems compliant with the Year 2000.

   Tandy is using a combination of internal and external resources to assess and
make the  needed  changes  to its many  different  information  systems  such as
mainframe applications and communications systems, among others. Since beginning
the  project  in  1995,  the  Company  has  modified,  or is in the  process  of
modifying,  over 50% of the specialized  software programs used in the Company's
business.  The  remaining  programs are expected to be modified and completed in
1998 and early 1999. Management  anticipates total expenditures  associated with
the Year 2000  internal  modifications  to range from $8.0 to $12.0 million over
the  life  of  the  project.   As  required  by  generally  accepted  accounting
principles, these costs are expensed as incurred.

   Additionally,  in the normal course of business, the Company has made capital
investments in certain third party software systems and  applications  purchased
to address the retail and  operational  needs of the  business.  These  systems,
which include a new point-of-sale  system and financial reporting system,  among
others,  have been  certified as Year 2000  compliant by the vendors and will be
installed prior to 2000.

   The  Company  has,  and will  continue  to  communicate  with its  suppliers,
financial institutions and others with which it does business to coordinate Year
2000  conversions.  Progress  reports  on the Year 2000  project  are  presented
periodically to the Company's Board of Directors.

   Although  there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete
all of the modifications in the required time frame, or that the Company will be
able to identify all Year 2000 issues before problems  manifest  themselves;  in
management's opinion, the Company is taking adequate action to address Year 2000
issues and does not expect the financial  impact of being Year 2000 compliant to
be  material  to the  Company's  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of
operations or cash flows.

   All schedules have been omitted because they are not applicable, not required
or the information is included in the consolidated financial statements or notes
thereto.

   Separate financial  statements of Tandy Corporation have been omitted because
Tandy is primarily an operating  company and the amount of restricted net assets
of  consolidated   and   unconsolidated   subsidiaries  and  Tandy's  equity  in
undistributed  earnings  of 50% or  less-owned  companies  accounted  for by the
equity method are not  significant.  All  subsidiaries of Tandy  Corporation are
included in the consolidated  financial statements.  Financial statements of 50%
or  less-owned  companies  have been  omitted  because  they do not,  considered
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a significant subsidiary.

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tandy Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index  on page 31  present  fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  financial
position of Tandy  Corporation and its subsidiaries  (the "Company") at December
31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997 in conformity with
generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These financial  statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management;  our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tandy Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
   Tandy  Corporation   ("Tandy"  or  the  "Company")  is  engaged  in  consumer
electronics   retailing   including  the  retail  sale  of  personal  computers.
RadioShack(R) is the largest of Tandy's retail store systems with  company-owned
stores and dealer/franchise  outlets.  RadioShack's sales and operating revenues
are primarily related to private label consumer electronics, brand name personal
computers, wireless communication products and services, telephony and direct to
home satellite systems.  Tandy also operates,  through its subsidiary,  Computer
City, Inc. ("CCI" or "Computer City") the Computer City(R) store chain. Computer
City  sales  relate  to  personal  computer  hardware  and  software,  printers,
peripheral  equipment and accessories  through retail locations and direct sales
to corporate, government and education customers.  Additionally, Tandy continues
to operate  certain  related  retail  support  groups and  consumer  electronics
manufacturing businesses.

   In December  1996,  the  Company  announced  its plan to exit the  Incredible
Universe business as well as certain other stores (see Note 4).

   NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The consolidated  financial  statements include
the accounts of Tandy and its majority owned subsidiaries. Investments in 20% to
50% owned  companies are accounted for on the equity method.  The fiscal periods
of certain foreign  operations end one month earlier than the Company's year end
to  facilitate  their  inclusion  in  the  consolidated   financial  statements.
Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

   FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  In accordance with the Financial  Accounting
Standards Board (the "FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52,
"Foreign Currency  Translation," balance sheet accounts of the Company's foreign
operations are translated from foreign  currencies into U.S. dollars at year end
or  historical  rates while income and expenses are  translated  at the weighted
average sales exchange rates for the year.  Translation  gains or losses related
to net  assets  located  outside  the  United  States  are  shown as a  separate
component  of  stockholders'  equity.  Gains and losses  resulting  from foreign
currency  transactions  (transactions  denominated  in a currency other than the
entity's functional  currency) are included in net income. Such foreign currency
transaction  gains were not significant for each of the years ended December 31,
1997, 1996 and 1995.

   EXTENDED SERVICE CONTRACTS:  Tandy's retail operations offer extended service
contracts on products sold. These contracts  generally  provide extended service
coverage for periods of 12 to 48 months. During 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company
sold extended service  contracts on behalf of an unrelated third party and, to a
much lesser  extent,  sold its own extended  service  contracts.  Contracts sold
prior to 1995 were  offered  directly by the Company.  The Company  accounts for
sales of its own contracts in accordance with FASB Technical  Bulletin No. 90-1,
"Accounting  for Separately  Priced  Extended  Warranty and Product  Maintenance
Contracts" which requires that revenues from sales of extended service contracts
be recognized ratably over the lives of the contracts. Costs directly related to
sales of such contracts are deferred and charged to expense  proportionately  as
the revenues are recognized.  A loss is recognized on extended service contracts
if the sum of the  expected  costs of  providing  services  under the  contracts
exceeds related  unearned  revenue.  Commission  revenue for the unrelated third
party extended service contracts is recognized at the time of sale.

   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:  Cash on hand in stores, deposits in banks and all
highly liquid  investments with a remaining  maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase are considered cash and cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents
are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

   MARKETABLE  SECURITIES:  The Company had an investment in AST common stock at
December 31, 1996 (see Note 7) which it sold on August 14, 1997. This investment
was  classified  as an  other  current  asset in the  accompanying  Consolidated
Balance  Sheet  at  December  31,  1996.  Pursuant  to  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 115,  "Accounting for Certain  Investments in Debt and
Equity  Securities"  ("FAS 115"),  this investment was categorized as "available
for sale". In accordance with FAS 115,  securities  classified as "available for
sale" are  marked to market  based upon  market  value  fluctuations.  Resulting
adjustments, net of deferred taxes, are reported as a component of stockholders'
equity until  realized.  Declines in fair value that are  considered to be other
than temporary are recognized in earnings and establish a new cost basis for the
security.  Realized  gains and  losses are also  included  in  earnings  and are
determined on the specific identification method.

   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS:  An allowance  for
doubtful accounts is provided when accounts are determined to be uncollectible.

   Concentrations  of credit  risk with  respect  to  customer  receivables  are
limited due to the large number of customers  comprising the Company's  customer
base and their location in many different geographic areas of the country.

   INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally based
on average cost) or market value and are comprised primarily of finished goods.

   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment are stated at cost. For
financial  reporting  purposes,  depreciation  and  amortization  are  primarily
calculated  using the  straight-line  method,  which  amortizes  the cost of the
assets over their estimated  useful lives.  The ranges of estimated useful lives
are:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buildings......................................               10-40 years
Buildings under capital lease..................over the life of the lease
Equipment......................................                2-15 years
Leasehold improvements......................... primarily, the shorter of
                                      the life of the improvements or the
                    term of the related lease and certain renewal periods
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   When depreciable assets are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts.  Any gains or losses are included in
selling,  general and administrative  expenses.  Major additions and betterments
are  capitalized.  Maintenance  and repairs which do not  materially  improve or
extend the lives of the respective  assets are charged to operating  expenses as
incurred.  Amortization  of  buildings  under  capital  leases  is  included  in
depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

   IMPAIRMENT  OF  LONG-LIVED  ASSETS:  Effective  January 1, 1996,  the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of  Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of"
("FAS 121") which requires that long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and
equipment  and  goodwill)  held and used by an entity or to be  disposed  of, be
reviewed for impairment  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate
that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss
will be  recognized if the sum of the expected  future cash flows  (undiscounted
and before  interest)  from the use of the asset is less than the net book value
of the asset.  The amount of the  impairment  loss will generally be measured as
the  difference  between the net book value of the assets and the estimated fair
value of the related assets. See Note 6 for further information.

   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  The fair value of financial instruments
is determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques
as  appropriate.  Unless  otherwise  disclosed,  the fair  values  of  financial
instruments  approximate  their recorded  values due primarily to the short-term
nature of their maturities or their varying interest rate.

   HEDGING AND DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY:  The Company entered into interest rate swap
agreements  in the first quarter of 1995 to manage its interest rate exposure by
effectively  trading  floating  interest  rates for fixed  interest  rates.  The
Company used the swaps to hedge certain  obligations with floating rates;  thus,
the difference  between the floating and fixed  interest rate amounts,  based on
these swap agreements,  was recorded as income or expense.  Through December 31,
1996,  the Company had entered  into five swaps with regard to notional  amounts
totaling  $90.0  million.  Prior to  1995,  the  Company  was not a party to any
interest rate swaps.  At December 31, 1996 and 1995,  the Company would have had
to pay approximately $3.8 million and $7.0 million,  respectively,  to terminate
the  interest  rate  swaps  in  place.  These  amounts  were  obtained  from the
counterparties and represent the fair value of the swap agreements.  At December
31, 1996,  the Company  recognized a  termination  charge equal to the estimated
amount the  Company  would be  required  to pay to  terminate  the swaps of $3.8
million due to the early  termination of the underlying  lease  obligations (see
Note 4). These swaps were terminated in March 1997 at no material gain or loss.

   The Company  has not  historically  utilized  derivatives  to manage  foreign
currency risks and exposure except for an immaterial  amount of foreign exchange
forward  contracts  used to hedge a  portion  of its  foreign  purchases.  As of
December 31, 1997,  the Company had no outstanding  purchase  orders for which a
foreign  exchange  contract  was  used  as  a  hedge.  Moody's  has  assigned  a
counterparty  rating to Tandy  Corporation of Baa2. This rating is an opinion of
the financial  capacity of Tandy to honor its senior obligations under financial
contracts.  Financial contracts entered into by Tandy include the limited use of
foreign  currency  forwards to hedge  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from the
purchase of inventory.

   REVENUES:  Retail sales are recorded on the accrual basis.

   INCOME  TAXES:  Income taxes are  accounted for using the asset and liability
method  pursuant  to  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" ("FAS 109"). Deferred taxes are recognized for the
tax consequences of "temporary  differences" by applying  enacted  statutory tax
rates applicable to future years to differences  between the financial statement
and carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and  liabilities.  The
effect on deferred  taxes for a change in tax rates is  recognized  in income in
the period that includes the enactment  date. In addition,  FAS 109 requires the
recognition  of future tax  benefits  to the  extent  that  realization  of such
benefits are more likely than not.

   EARNINGS  PER SHARE:  Effective   December  31,  1997,  the  Company  adopted
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share" ("FAS
128"). FAS 128 establishes  standards for computing and presenting  earnings per
share ("EPS"). The statement requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS
on the face of the income statement for entities with complex capital structures
and requires a reconciliation  of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS
computation  to the numerator and  denominator  of the diluted EPS  computation.
Basic EPS excludes the effect of potentially  dilutive  securities while diluted
EPS reflects the  potential  dilution  that would have occurred if securities or
other contracts to issue common stock were exercised,  converted, or resulted in
the  issuance of common stock that would have then shared in the earnings of the
entity.  EPS data for the year ended  December  31,  1997 and all prior  periods
presented  herein have been  restated  to conform  with the  provisions  of this
statement.  The following is a  reconciliation  of the numerator and denominator
used in the basic and diluted EPS calculation:

   Options to purchase  0.7 million  and 0.9 million  shares of common  stock in
1997 and 1995,  respectively,  were not included in the  computation  of diluted
earnings per common share because the option exercise price was greater than the
average  market price of the common stock during the year. In 1996,  4.6 million
options to purchase  common stock and an additional 3.6 million shares of Series
B preferred stock were not included in the  computation of diluted  earnings per
common  share  because the Company was in a loss  position  and their  inclusion
would have been antidilutive.

   STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION:  The Company adopted,  on a disclosure basis only,
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" in 1996. The Company continues to measure compensation costs under
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion  25,  "Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to
Employees" and its related interpretations.

   ADVERTISING  COSTS:  All  advertising  costs of the Company are  expensed the
first time the advertising takes place.  Advertising expense was $195.4 million,
$254.6  million,  and $257.3 million for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996
and 1995, respectively.

     CAPITALIZED  SOFTWARE  COSTS:  The  Company  capitalizes  qualifying  costs
relating to developing or obtaining  internal-use  software.  Capitalization  of
costs  begins  after  the  conceptual  formulation  stage  has  been  completed.
Capitalized  costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software,
which ranges  between  three and five years.  Capitalized  costs at December 31,
1997, 1996 and 1995 totaled $25.4 million,  $23.5 million and $3.5 million,  net
of  accumulated  amortization  of $5.7  million,  $2.4 million and $1.5 million,
respectively.  In January  1998,  the American  Institute  of  Certified  Public
Accountants  issued  Statement of Position  98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of
Computer Software  Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" ("SOP 98-1"). The SOP
becomes  effective for all fiscal years  beginning  after December 15, 1998. The
Company's current policy falls within the guidelines of SOP 98-1.

   PERVASIVENESS  OF  ESTIMATES:  The  preparation  of financial  statements  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities,  and related revenues and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss
contingencies  at the date of the  financial  statements.  Actual  results could
differ from those estimates.

     RECLASSIFICATION:  Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to
conform to current year presentation.

NOTE 3 - STOCK SPLIT
   On August 21, 1997, the Company's  Board of Directors  declared a two-for-one
split of Tandy common stock for  stockholders of record at the close of business
on August 29, 1997, payable on September 22, 1997. This resulted in the issuance
of 52.7 million  shares of common stock along with a  corresponding  decrease of
$52.7 million in additional  paid-in  capital.  Treasury  shares were not split;
however, an adjustment was made to the Company's stockholders' equity section of
the balance sheet to split the cost of treasury  stock (in effect a cancellation
of treasury  shares).  All  references  to the number of shares of common  stock
issued or outstanding,  per share prices, and income per common share amounts in
the  consolidated  financial  statements  and the  accompanying  notes have been
adjusted to reflect the split on a retroactive  basis.  Previously awarded stock
options,  restricted  stock  awards,  and all other  agreements  payable  in the
Company's  common  stock have been  adjusted  or  amended to reflect  the split.
Additionally, cash dividends which were $0.20 per share per quarter prior to the
two-for-one  split have been  adjusted to $0.10 per share per quarter to reflect
the two-for-one split.

NOTE 4 - PROVISION FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING
   In  1996,  Tandy  initiated  certain  restructuring  programs  affecting  its
Incredible  Universe and  Computer  City stores and its  remaining  McDuff store
operations.  These  restructuring  programs  were  undertaken as a result of the
highly competitive  environment in the electronics  industry.  The components of
the  restructuring  charge and an analysis of the  reserves  are outlined in the
1996 Restructuring table below.

   The  Company  recorded a pre-tax  charge of $25.5  million  during the second
quarter  of  1996  related  to  an  Incredible  Universe  restructuring  program
announced in May 1996. The charge related primarily to future lease obligations,
disposition  of fixed assets,  and certain  termination  costs  associated  with
employees.  This program included an overhead reduction plan, the closing of two
stores  in the  second  quarter  of 1996 due to  inadequate  sales  volumes  and
non-recoverable costs incurred with certain real estate sites held for new store
development.  The Company also recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $136.6
million in the fourth quarter of 1996 related to the closing of the remaining 53
McDuff  stores,  exiting the  Incredible  Universe  business  (consisting  of 17
remaining open stores), and the closure of 21 unprofitable Computer City stores.
The fourth quarter charges related primarily to lease  obligations,  real estate
costs,  employee  termination  expenses  and  contract  cancellation  costs.  In
association  with  the 1996  restructurings,  the  Company  also  recognized  an
impairment  charge of $112.8 million  pursuant to FAS 121 (see Note 6) and lower
of cost or market impairments aggregating  approximately $91.4 million primarily
related to  inventory  that was  liquidated  at the affected  stores.  Inventory
impairment  charges were recognized in the Consolidated  Statements of Income as
an increase in cost of sales in 1996.

   In January 1997,  the Company closed the respective 53 McDuff and 21 Computer
City stores.  The sale of the real estate of six Incredible  Universe stores and
related fixed assets and inventory to Fry's Electronics, Inc. and its affiliates
("Fry's") was concluded in July 1997 for approximately $21.5 million in cash and
$97.4 million in notes  receivable with no material gain or loss recognized upon
the sale. At December 31, 1997, the notes receivable  balance was $75.3 million.
The  interest  rates on the notes  range  from  approximately  5.9% to 6.7% with
maturity  dates  ranging  from  one  year to five  years.  The  sales  of  seven
additional  Incredible  Universe locations were completed during July and August
1997 for $81.2 million in cash, notes receivable and marketable securities,  the
securities  having been  subsequently  sold for cash. Again, no material gain or
loss  was  recognized  upon  the  sale  of  the  assets.   The  note  receivable
approximated  $0.9  million at December 31, 1997.  The lease was  terminated  on
another  location  during the fourth  quarter of 1997,  leaving  five  locations
remaining at December 31, 1997.

   As of March 18,  1998,  signed  agreements  existed to sell the  building and
leasehold  improvements  on  two  other  Incredible  Universe  locations  and to
sublease  the  land  at one of  these  locations,  subject  to  obtaining  final
approvals  and  permits.   Management   anticipates  that  the  three  remaining
Incredible  Universe locations will be sold,  subleased or the leases terminated
with the lessors by the third quarter of 1998, based on signed letters of intent
obtained by the Company and/or negotiations currently in process; however, there
can be no assurance  that such  planned  disposals  or lease  terminations  will
occur.

   Sales and  operating  revenues  and  operating  losses of the  stores  closed
pursuant to the restructuring plans are shown below for each year ended December
31 (unaudited):

    Operating loss (1)                 (30.1)      (114.4)      (62.3)

(1) The  operating  loss for 1997  excludes a reserve  estimate  recorded in the
    fourth  quarter of 1997 of an  additional  $11.6  million  relating to store
    closings  pursuant  to the  1996  store  closure  plan.  The  $11.6  million
    provision is included in selling,  general and administrative expense in the
    accompanying 1997 Consolidated Statements of Income.

   Although no significant  additional  provisions are expected in 1998 relating
to the 1996  restructuring,  unexpected  delays in the  closing  of real  estate
sales, among other factors, may result in additional charges.

   The components of the combined  restructuring  charges and an analysis of the
amounts charged against the reserve are outlined in the following table:

NOTE 5 - NEW COMPUTER CITY STRATEGY
     On June  26,  1997,  the  Company  organized  a new  subsidiary,  CCI,  and
thereafter  conveyed  to it  certain  related  assets  and  liabilities  of  the
Company's Computer City division.  On July 17, 1997, Eureka Venture Partners III
LLP, a Texas  limited  liability  partnership  ("Eureka")  entered  into a Stock
Purchase Agreement with the Company (the "Stock Purchase  Agreement") to acquire
19.9% of the outstanding common stock of CCI for a total purchase price of $24.9
million,  payable  in cash (1% of the  purchase  price)  and a note  (99% of the
purchase price) issued by Eureka.  The note is secured only by the common shares
of CCI held by Eureka. Accordingly,  this transaction has not been recognized as
a sale for accounting  purposes and Tandy continues to consolidate 100% of CCI's
results of operations. The note bears interest at 8% per annum and is payable on
or before July 17, 2002.  Eureka,  on July 17, 1997,  also acquired a warrant to
purchase an additional  20.1% of the  outstanding  common stock of CCI for $31.4
million  payable  in cash (at least 10% of the  purchase  price) and a note (not
more  than  90% of the  purchase  price)  issued  by  Eureka.  This  warrant  is
exercisable upon either the attainment of certain financial performance goals by
CCI or upon the date CCI is  established  as an  independent  entity as  defined
pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement.

   Eureka has the option to require the Company to  repurchase  all shares owned
by Eureka and the warrant in the event that it is exercisable  but  unexercised,
upon payment of certain amounts, as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement, if
certain  financial  performance  goals  are  met by CCI and  the  CCI  Board  of
Directors does not approve the establishment of CCI as an independent  entity by
means of one or more transactions.  Additionally, prior to CCI being established
as an  independent  entity,  the Company has the right to  reacquire  all of the
shares  of CCI  owned  by  Eureka  and  the  warrant  in the  event  that  it is
exercisable but unexercised,  upon payment of certain amounts,  as determined by
defined formulas pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement.

   Sales and operating  revenues,  operating losses, and restructuring and other
charges  (before  interest  and taxes) for CCI for each of the three years ended
December 31 are presented below:
      
                                            1997          1996           1995
                                          --------      --------       --------
   Sales and operating revenues           $1,903.7      $2,080.5       $1,779.2

   Restructuring and other charges              --         (54.2)            --
         
   As  described  more fully in Note 4, during the fourth  quarter of 1996 Tandy
elected to close 21 unprofitable stores. CCI recognized a pre-tax  restructuring
charge  aggregating  $14.8 million  associated with these closings.  The charges
related primarily to lease obligations and employee  termination  expenses.  CCI
also recognized impairment charges pursuant to FAS 121 aggregating $18.7 million
during 1996 and lower of cost or market  impairments  aggregating  approximately
$20.7  million  related  to  inventory   liquidated  at  the  affected   stores.
Additionally, the new management team at CCI has taken and will continue to take
certain actions to increase  revenues and achieve  profitability.  These actions
include  increasing  service revenues which typically have a higher gross margin
than merchandise sales, increasing direct sales to corporations,  government and
education customers, creating a build-to-order program which allows customers to
order  custom-configured  personal  computers,  and  developing  the  ability to
purchase products on-line via the Internet.  Management of CCI and Tandy believe
that these actions will result in improved operating performance; however, there
can be no assurance that  increased  sales and  profitability  will be achieved.
Should  these  actions  fail to  increase  sales and achieve  operating  profit,
management may be required to close  additional  stores,  sell certain assets or
take other measures deemed necessary to achieve improved operating performance.

NOTE 6 - IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
   Upon adoption of FAS 121 in the first quarter of 1996, the Company recognized
an initial non-cash  impairment loss of  approximately  $26.0 million to conform
with this  statement,  primarily  as a result of grouping  long-lived  assets at
their  lowest level of cash flows to  determine  impairment  as required by this
statement.  Fair value was principally  determined  based upon estimated  future
discounted cash flows (before interest) related to each group of assets.

   The Company  recognized an  additional  non-cash  impairment  charge of $86.8
million  in the fourth  quarter of 1996  primarily  related to the  disposal  of
certain long-lived assets pursuant to its restructuring plan (see Note 4). These
assets principally related to the Incredible Universe,  Computer City and McDuff
stores  that were part of the store  closure  plan,  and  certain  foreign  real
estate. Fair value was principally determined by quoted market prices.

NOTE 7 - AST SECURITIES
   On July 12,  1996,  the  Company  received  $60.0  million  in cash and $30.0
million in AST common  stock as final  payment of a $90.0  million  note payable
from AST to the Company.  The Company's  original cost basis  approximated $6.67
per share.

   During the fourth  quarter of 1996,  the Company  sold  85,000  shares of the
acquired stock for proceeds  aggregating $0.5 million.  Based upon AST's closing
market price at December 31, 1996, and a proposal from Samsung  Electronics Co.,
Ltd.  ("Samsung") to purchase the remaining  outstanding shares of AST for $5.10
per share,  the Company  recognized  a pre-tax loss of $7.0 million on the stock
because the decline in the price was determined to be other than temporary.  The
$7.0 million loss was charged to selling, general and administrative expenses in
the  accompanying  1996  Consolidated  Statements of Income.  The then remaining
unrealized pre-tax loss of $4.0 million,  considered a temporary market decline,
was recorded as a $2.6 million, net of tax, reduction to stockholders' equity.

   During August 1997,  the Company sold the remaining  4,413,594  shares of AST
common  stock  under a tender  offer from  Samsung  for total  proceeds of $23.8
million and recovered the $2.6 million,  net of tax,  temporary  market  decline
originally  recorded  as a  reduction  of equity.  Additionally,  a gain of $1.3
million was  recognized  on the sale which has been  included as a reduction  to
SG&A expense in the accompanying 1997 Consolidated Statements of Income.

NOTE 8 - SALE OF CREDIT OPERATIONS
   In December 1994, the Company sold its Computer City and Incredible  Universe
private  label  credit  card  portfolios  to  SPS   Transactions   Services,   a
majority-owned  subsidiary  of Dean  Witter,  Discover & Company  ("SPS").  As a
result of the  transaction,  Tandy received cash of $85.8 million at the time of
the sale,  and a deferred  payment of $179.8  million  during 1995.  The Company
discounted  the  deferred   payment  by  5.0%  to  yield   interest   income  of
approximately $3.5 million over the twelve month payout period.

   On March 30, 1995, the Company  completed the sale, at net book value, of the
RadioShack  and  Tandy  Name  Brand  private  label  credit  card  accounts  and
substantially all related accounts receivable to Hurley State Bank, a subsidiary
of SPS. As a result of the  transaction,  Tandy received  $342.8 million in cash
and a  deferred  payment  of $49.4  million.  All of the  deferred  payment  was
received in 1995, except for $2.1 million, which was received in 1996.

NOTE 9 - CASH EQUIVALENTS
   The weighted  average  interest rates were 5.9% and 5.7% at December 31, 1997
and 1996,  respectively,  for cash equivalents  totaling $53.1 million and $25.4
million, respectively.

NOTE 13 - TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
   On March  3,  1997,  the  Company  announced  that  its  Board  of  Directors
authorized  management  to purchase an  additional  10.0  million  shares of its
common stock through the Company's existing share repurchase program.  The share
repurchase  program was  initially  authorized in December 1995 and increased in
October 1996. The share increase for 1997 brings the total authorization to 30.0
million shares of which 21.0 million shares,  totaling $529.2 million,  had been
purchased as of December 31, 1997. These purchases are in addition to the shares
required for employee plans which are purchased throughout the year.

NOTE 14 - INDEBTEDNESS AND BORROWING FACILITIES
   Tandy's short-term credit facilities,  including  revolving credit lines, are
summarized in the accompanying  short-term borrowing facilities table below. The
method used to compute averages in the short-term  borrowing facilities table is
based on a daily weighted average computation which takes into consideration the
time period such debt was  outstanding  as well as the amount  outstanding.  The
Company's primary source of short-term debt, for which borrowings and repayments
are  presented net of each other in the  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows,
consists of short-term  seasonal bank debt and commercial  paper. The commercial
paper has a typical maturity of 90 days or less, as does the short-term seasonal
bank debt.

   The  Company  has an  active  commercial  paper  program.  A  $500.0  million
committed facility is in place as backup for the commercial paper program.  This
facility is composed of two agreements:  a one-year  facility for $200.0 million
expiring  June 1998 and a five-year  facility for $300.0  million  expiring June
2001.  Annual  commitment  fees for the two  facilities  are 0.07% of the $200.0
million  facility per annum and 0.10% of the $300.0 million  facility per annum,
respectively,  whether used or unused.  The banks limit the amount of commercial
paper that may be  outstanding to a maximum of $500.0  million.  At December 31,
1997, there was $35.0 million of commercial paper outstanding backed up by these
facilities.

   On August 19, 1997,  the Company  issued $150.0  million of 10 year unsecured
senior  notes under a $300.0  million  Debt Shelf  Registration  Statement  (the
"Registration Statement"), which was effective August 6, 1997. The interest rate
on the notes is 6.95% per annum with interest payable on September 1 and March 1
of each year, commencing on March 1, 1998. The notes are due September 1, 2007.

   In December 1997, the Company issued $4.0 million in medium-term  notes under
the remaining $150.0 million of the Registration Statement.  Tandy's medium-term
notes   outstanding  at  December  31,  1997  under  the  1991  and  1997  shelf
registrations  totaled $30.0  million  compared to $54.5 million at December 31,
1996. The interest rates at December 31, 1997 for the outstanding  $30.0 million
in  medium-term  notes  ranged from 6.31% to 8.63%,  with the  weighted  average
coupon rates being 8.2% and 8.5% at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

   On July 17, 1997, the Company provided to CCI a $150.0 million line of credit
which expired on December 31, 1997. Any borrowings and related  interest charges
on this line of credit between CCI and the Company were treated as  intercompany
and eliminated in  consolidation.  On December 19, 1997, CCI replaced the $150.0
million line of credit with a revolving  credit facility with a syndicate of six
banks. As of December 31, 1997, $30.0 million was outstanding under this line of
credit.  This $150.0 million  credit  facility  matures in December 1998.  Tandy
Corporation is the guarantor of the new credit line.

   The Company  established  an  employee  stock  ownership  trust in June 1990.
Further  information  on the  trust  and  its  related  indebtedness,  which  is
guaranteed  by the Company,  is detailed in the  discussion of the Tandy Fund in
Note 19.

   Long-term  borrowings and capital lease  obligations  outstanding at December
31, 1997 mature as follows:

   The fair value of the Company's  long-term debt of $224.9 million  (including
current portion,  but excluding capital leases) is approximately  $230.6 million
at December 31, 1997.  The fair value was computed  using  interest  rates which
were in effect at December 31, 1997 for similar debt instruments.

   Borrowings  payable  within  one  year  are  summarized  in the  accompanying
short-term  debt table below.  The short-term  debt caption  includes  primarily
domestic seasonal borrowings.

NOTE 15 - LEASES AND COMMITMENTS
   Tandy leases rather than owns most of its facilities.  The RadioShack  stores
comprise the largest  portion of Tandy's leased  facilities.  The RadioShack and
Computer City stores are located  primarily in major  shopping  malls,  shopping
centers or freestanding  facilities owned by other  companies.  Store leases are
generally  based on a minimum  rental plus a percentage  of the store's sales in
excess of a stipulated base figure.  Tandy also leases distribution  centers and
office space.

   Future  minimum  rent  commitments  at December  31,  1997 for all  long-term
noncancelable  leases (net of  immaterial  amounts of sublease  rent income) are
included in the following table.

   The 1996 tax rate  differed from the 1997 and 1995 tax rates due primarily to
foreign  income taxes which were incurred on foreign  income despite the overall
loss incurred by the Company.

     Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 were
comprised of the following:

NOTE 18 - TANDY STOCK PLAN
   Eligible employees may contribute 1% to 7% of annual compensation to purchase
Company common stock at fair market value.  The Company  matches 40%, 60% or 80%
of the  employee's  contribution  depending  on  the  length  of the  employee's
continuous  participation in the Tandy Stock Plan. Tandy's  contributions to the
Stock Plan were $13.7  million,  $14.5  million and $18.0  million for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

NOTE 19 - TANDY FUND
   On January 1, 1996, the Tandy Employees  Stock  Ownership Plan  ("TESOP"),  a
leveraged  employee stock  ownership plan, was amended and merged with the Tandy
Employees Deferred Salary and Investment Plan ("DIP") and renamed the Tandy Fund
("Plan"). The Plan is a defined contribution plan.

   Eligible employees are provided with the choice to direct their contributions
into various investment  options,  including  investing in Company common stock.
Participants may defer, via direct salary  reductions,  a minimum of 1% of gross
salary and wages up to a maximum of 8%, in increments of 1%.  Contributions  per
participant  are limited to certain annual maximums as set forth by the Internal
Revenue Code.

   Company  contributions  are made directly to the Tandy Fund through the TESOP
portion of the Plan.  Participants become fully vested in Company  contributions
upon the  earlier to occur of five years of  service  with the  Company or three
years of participation in the Plan.

   TESOP Portion of the Tandy Fund:  On July 31, 1990,  prior to its merger into
the  Tandy  Fund,  the  trustee  of the  TESOP,  which  is now  the  Tandy  Fund
(collectively the "Tandy Fund"),  borrowed $100.0 million at an interest rate of
9.34% with varying semiannual  principal payments due through June 30, 2000. The
Tandy Fund  trustee  used the  proceeds  from the  issuance of the 1990 notes to
purchase 100,000 shares of TESOP Preferred Stock from Tandy at a price of $1,000
per share.  In December  1994,  the Tandy Fund entered into an agreement with an
unrelated third party to refinance a portion of the Tandy Fund's indebtedness by
borrowing $5.1 million at 8.76%. This debt matures in December 2000. Pursuant to
that  agreement,  in December  1997,  1996 and 1995,  the Tandy Fund borrowed an
additional  $2.2  million at 6.73%,  $3.5  million at 7.01% and $4.3  million at
6.47%,  respectively.  This additional indebtedness matures in December of 2002,
2001 and 2001, respectively. Dividend payments and contributions from Tandy will
be used to repay  the  indebtedness.  Each  share of  TESOP  Preferred  Stock is
convertible  into 43.536 shares of Company common stock.  The annual  cumulative
dividend on TESOP  Preferred Stock is $75.00 per share,  payable  semi-annually.
Because Tandy has guaranteed the repayment of these notes,  the  indebtedness of
the Tandy Fund is  recognized  as a  long-term  obligation  in the  accompanying
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  An  offsetting  charge  has  been  made  in  the
stockholders' equity section of the accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheets to
reflect unearned compensation related to the Tandy Fund.

   Compensation  and  interest  costs  related  to the  Tandy  Fund  before  the
reduction for the  allocation  of dividends  are  presented  below for each year
ended December 31:

  (In millions)                 1997          1996          1995
  -------------                 ----          ----          ----
  Compensation                $  9.5        $  8.0        $  7.5
  Interest                       4.4           5.1           5.7

   During  the term of the  TESOP  notes,  the  TESOP  Preferred  Stock  will be
allocated to the  participants  annually based on the total debt service made on
the indebtedness.

   As shares of the  TESOP  Preferred  Stock  are  allocated  to the Tandy  Fund
participants,  compensation  expense is recorded  and unearned  compensation  is
reduced. Interest expense on the TESOP notes is also recognized as a cost of the
Tandy Fund. The  compensation  component of the Tandy Fund expense is reduced by
the amount of dividends accrued on the TESOP Preferred Stock, with any dividends
in excess of the  compensation  expense  reflected  as a  reduction  of interest
expense.

   Contributions  from Tandy to the Tandy Fund for the years ended  December 31,
1997,  1996 and 1995 totaled $14.5  million,  $11.4  million and $11.2  million,
respectively,  including  dividends  paid on the TESOP  Preferred  Stock of $6.1
million, $6.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively.

   At  December  31,  1997,  55,238  shares  of TESOP  Preferred  Stock had been
released and allocated to  participants'  accounts in the Tandy Fund  (including
20,130 shares which had been withdrawn by  participants).  At December 31, 1997,
an  additional  10,052  shares  of  TESOP  Preferred  Stock  were  released  for
allocation  to  participants  at the March 31, 1998 annual  allocation  date. At
December 31, 1997,  34,710 shares of TESOP  Preferred  Stock were  available for
later release and  allocation  to  participants  over the remaining  life of the
TESOP notes.  The appraised  value of these shares was $59.5 million at December
31, 1997.

   The TESOP  Preferred  Stock has certain  liquidation  preferences  and may be
redeemed after July 1, 1994, at specified premiums.

NOTE 20 - STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS
   The Company applies Accounting  Principles Board ("APB"),  Opinion No. 25 and
related  interpretations  in accounting  for its stock option  plans,  which are
described below.  Historically,  the exercise price of options has been equal to
or  greater  than  fair  market  value at the  date of  grant.  Accordingly,  no
compensation cost has been recognized for its stock option plans.

   Tandy Corporation 1985 Stock Option Plan ("1985 SOP"): Under the 1985 SOP, as
amended,  options  to  acquire up to 4.0  million  registered  shares of Tandy's
common  stock  were  authorized  to be granted to  officers  and key  management
employees of the Company.  No further  grants may be made under the 1985 SOP, as
its term has expired.  The Organization and Compensation  Committee of the Board
of Directors (the  "Committee")  had sole discretion in the granting of options.
Generally,  the term of  incentive  stock  options  did not  exceed 10 years and
vested  ratably over three years.  Nonstatutory  stock  options did not exceed a
term of 10 years plus one month and vested ratably over five years.  The options
did not have an exercise  price less than 100% of fair  market  value of Company
common stock on date of grant.

   Under the 1985 SOP there were  916,513 and  1,596,260  vested  options  which
could have been  exercised  for a total price of $15.6 million and $27.7 million
at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

   Tandy  Corporation 1993 Incentive Stock Plan ("1993 ISP"): In March 1993, the
Board of Directors  adopted the 1993 ISP, which was approved by the shareholders
in October 1993. A total of 6.0 million shares of the Company's common stock was
reserved for issuance under the 1993 ISP. In May 1995, the shareholders approved
an  amendment  to the 1993 ISP to provide for an initial  option grant of 10,000
shares to each  non-employee  director,  to increase the annual September option
grant to directors  from 6,000 to 8,000 shares and to provide for payment of all
or one-half of director retainer fees in Company common stock.

   The  1993  ISP  permits  the  grant  of  incentive  stock  options  ("ISOs"),
nonstatutory  stock  options  (options  which  are  not  ISOs)  ("NSOs"),  stock
appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock, performance units or performance
shares.

   Grants of  options  under the 1993 ISP  shall be for terms  specified  by the
Committee,  except  that the term shall not exceed 10 years.  Provisions  of the
1993 ISP generally provide that in the event of a change in control, all options
become  immediately  and fully  exercisable  and all  restrictions on restricted
stock lapse.

   As part of the 1993 ISP, the shareholders  approved an amendment in May 1995,
whereby each  non-employee  director of the Company receives a grant of NSOs for
8,000  shares  of the  Company's  common  stock  on the  first  business  day of
September of each year ("Director  Options").  Director Options have an exercise
price of 100% of the fair  market  value of the  Company's  common  stock on the
trading  day  prior to the date of grant,  vest as to  one-third  of the  shares
annually on the first three anniversary dates of the date of grant and expire 10
years after the date of grant.

   The exercise price of an option (other than a Director  Option) is determined
by the  Committee,  provided that the exercise price shall not be less than 100%
of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of
grant.

   Under the 1993 ISP, there were  1,528,054 and 1,138,860  vested options which
could have been  exercised for a total exercise price of $34.8 million and $25.1
million at December 31, 1997 and 1996,  respectively.  In addition,  at December
31,  1997 and 1996 there were  59,160  and  2,774,878  shares  available  for
additional grants under the 1993 ISP, respectively. The 1993 ISP shall terminate
on the tenth  anniversary  of the day  preceding the date of its adoption by the
Board and no option or award shall be granted under the 1993 ISP thereafter.

   The Company granted,  under the 1993 ISP on February 1, 1997, an aggregate of
approximately  2,041,200  restricted  stock  awards of 400 shares  each to 4,907
RadioShack  store  managers  and 800  shares  each  to 98  Computer  City  store
managers.  The  restricted  stock  awards had a weighted  average  fair value of
$22.59 per share when  granted.  Vesting of the  restricted  stock occurs at the
earlier of the  following:  (1) if managers are  employed as a store  manager or
higher  position by the Company  after  February 1, 1999 and the Company  common
stock closes at $33 13/16 or more for 20  consecutive  trading  days,  the stock
will vest at that time, and  otherwise,  (2) the shares will vest on February 1,
2002 if the managers are employed as store managers or a higher  position of the
Company, at that time.  Compensation expense,  equal to the fair market value of
the shares upon vesting,  will be recognized  when it becomes  probable that the
performance  criteria  will be met or upon actual  vesting.  As of December  31,
1997,  there were 1,658,800  stock awards  outstanding and eligible for ultimate
vesting pursuant to this restricted stock award.

   The  Company,  as of February  1, 1997,  also  granted  under the 1993 ISP an
aggregate  of  approximately  370,500  stock  options  of 1,500  shares  each to
RadioShack  district sales  managers,  3,000 shares each to RadioShack  regional
sales  managers,  and 2,000  shares each to Computer  City sales  managers.  The
exercise  price of the options is equal to the fair market  value at the date of
the grant.

   On May 15, 1997, the Committee awarded a total of 26,000 shares of restricted
stock under the 1993 ISP to two executive  officers,  based on past performance.
Compensation expense of approximately $1.0 million was recognized in association
with the restricted stock awards.

   Tandy  Corporation  1997 Incentive Stock Plan ("1997 ISP"): In February 1997,
the Board of Directors  adopted the 1997 ISP, which was approved by shareholders
on May 15, 1997. A total of 5.5 million shares of the Company's common stock was
reserved for issuance under the 1997 ISP. The 1997 ISP provides that the maximum
number of shares of Company  common stock that an eligible  employee may receive
in any calendar year in respect of options and performance awards may not exceed
500,000  shares.  The maximum  dollar amount of cash or the fair market value of
shares in any calendar year in respect of performance  units may not exceed $1.5
million.

   The 1997  ISP  permits  the  grant of ISOs,  NSOs,  SARs,  restricted  stock,
performance units or performance shares.

   Grants of  options  under the 1997 ISP  shall be for terms  specified  by the
Committee,  except  that the term shall not exceed 10 years.  Provisions  of the
1997 ISP generally provide that in the event of a change in control, all options
become  immediately  and fully  exercisable  and all  restrictions on restricted
stock lapse. In addition,  a pre-determined  percentage of any performance units
vests and  restrictions  on a  pre-determined  percentage of performance  shares
lapse.

   As part of the 1997 ISP, each non-employee  director of the Company receives,
unless a grant is made at that time under the 1993 ISP,  Director  Options under
similar terms as described in the 1993 ISP section  above.  New  directors  upon
election or appointment will, unless a grant is made at that time under the 1993
ISP, receive a one-time grant of 10,000 shares.

   The exercise  price of shares under an option (other than a Director  Option)
is determined by the  Committee,  provided that the exercise  price shall not be
less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock
on the date of grant.  As provided in the 1997 ISP, the  exercise  price of each
Director  Option  shall not be less than  100% of the fair  market  value of the
Company's common stock on the day preceding the date of grant.

   Under the 1997 ISP,  there were no vested  options at December 31,  1997.  In
addition,  there were 5.5 million  shares  available  on  December  31, 1997 for
grants under the 1997 ISP.

   The Company granted,  under the 1997 ISP on February 1, 1998, an aggregate of
approximately  324,750  restricted  stock  awards  of 250  shares  each to 1,299
RadioShack  store  managers  not  included  in the  February  1,  1997  grant as
described in the 1993 ISP section above.  Vesting of the restricted stock occurs
at the earlier of the following: (1) if managers are employed as a store manager
or higher  position by the Company after February 1, 2000 and the Company common
stock closes at $58 1/8 or more for 20 consecutive  trading days, the stock will
vest at that time, and  otherwise,  (2) the shares will vest on February 1, 2003
if the  managers  are  employed as store  managers  or a higher  position of the
Company, at that time.  Compensation expense,  equal to the fair market value of
the shares upon vesting,  will be recognized  when it becomes  probable that the
performance criteria will be met or upon actual vesting.

   The Company also granted under the 1997 ISP on February 1, 1998, an aggregate
of approximately 178,500 stock options of 750 shares each to RadioShack district
sales  managers,  1,500 shares each to RadioShack  regional  sales  managers and
1,000  shares  each  to  three   RadioShack   members  of   management   in  the
dealer/franchise  department.  The exercise price of the options is equal to the
fair market value at the date of the grant.

   Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share as required
by  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  123,  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation" ("FAS 123") has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options and  restricted  stock awards under the
fair value method of that statement. The fair value of each option or restricted
stock award is  estimated  on the date of grant using the  Black-Scholes  option
pricing model. The weighted average  assumptions used for stock option grants in
1997, 1996 and 1995 were,  respectively:  expected  dividend yield of 1.7%, 2.0%
and 1.3%,  expected  volatility  of 25.5%,  27.9% and 27.3%;  risk free interest
rates of 6.1%,  6.7% and 6.1%; and expected lives of six, seven and seven years.
The weighted average  assumptions used for restricted stock grants in 1997 were:
expected  dividend  yield of 1.7%,  expected  volatility  of  25.9%,  risk  free
interest rate of 6.3% and expected life of five years.

   For  purposes  of pro forma  disclosures,  the  estimated  fair  value of the
options and  restricted  stock  awards is  amortized to expense over the vesting
period. The Company's pro forma information follows:

NOTE 21 - PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
   In August 1986, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder  rights plan and
declared  a dividend  of one right for each  outstanding  share of Tandy  common
stock. The rights, as amended, which will expire on June 22, 2000, are currently
represented by the common stock  certificates  and when they become  exercisable
will entitle holders to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Tandy Series A
Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock for an exercise price of $70 (subject to
adjustment).  The rights will become  exercisable and will trade separately from
the common stock only upon the date of public announcement that a person, entity
or group ("Person") has acquired 15% or more of Tandy's outstanding common stock
without the prior consent or approval of the disinterested directors ("Acquiring
Person") or ten days after the  commencement or public  announcement of a tender
or exchange offer which would result in any person becoming an Acquiring Person.
In the event that any person  becomes an  Acquiring  Person,  the rights will be
exercisable  for 60 days  thereafter  for Tandy common stock with a prior market
value (as determined  under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise  price.
In the event that,  after any person  becomes an Acquiring  Person,  the Company
engages in certain mergers, consolidations,  or sales of assets representing 50%
or more of its assets or  earning  power with an  Acquiring  Person (or  persons
acting on behalf of or in  concert  with an  Acquiring  Person)  or in which all
holders of common stock are not treated  alike,  the rights will be  exercisable
for common stock of the acquiring or surviving company with a prior market value
(as  determined  under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise  price.  The
rights  will  not be  exercisable  by  any  Acquiring  Person.  The  rights  are
redeemable  at a price of  $0.05  per  right  prior to any  person  becoming  an
Acquiring  Person or, under certain  circumstances,  after the expiration of the
60-day period  described above, but the rights may not be redeemed or the rights
plan amended for 180 days following a change in a majority of the members of the
Board (or if certain agreements are entered into during such 180-day period).

NOTE 22 - TERMINATION PROTECTION PLANS
   In  August  1990 and in May  1995,  the  Board of  Directors  of the  Company
approved amendments to the termination protection plans. These plans provide for
defined termination benefits to be paid to eligible employees of the Company who
have been  terminated,  without  cause,  following  a change in  control  of the
Company  (as  defined).  In  addition,  for a certain  period of time  following
employee  termination,  the Company, at its expense, must continue to provide on
behalf of the  terminated  employee  certain  employment  benefits.  In general,
during the twelve  months  following  a change in  control,  the Company may not
terminate or change existing employee benefit plans in any way which will effect
accrued  benefits  or decrease  the rate of the  Company's  contribution  to the
plans.

NOTE 23 - ISSUANCE OF SERIES C PERCS AND TENDER OFFER
   In February 1992, the Company issued 15.0 million depositary shares of Series
C Conversion  Preferred Stock ("Series C PERCS") at $29.50 per depositary  share
(equivalent to $2,950.00 for each Series C PERCS). Each of the depositary shares
represented  ownership  of  1/100th  of a share of  Series C PERCS.  The  annual
dividend for each depositary  share was $2.14 (based on the annual dividend rate
for each Series C PERCS of $214.00).

   Tandy  announced on January 23, 1995 that it had  exercised its right to call
all the issued and outstanding  Series C PERCS for conversion on March 10, 1995,
prior to its  mandatory  conversion  date of April 15,  1995.  For each Series C
PERCS depositary share redeemed, 1.575514 Tandy common shares were issued for an
aggregate of approximately 23.6 million shares. In addition, each Series C PERCS
depositary share received a dividend in cash of $0.321  representing the accrued
dividend from January 16, 1995 through the redemption date of March 10, 1995.

NOTE 24 - SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
   Cash flows from operating activities included cash payments as follows:

                                       Year Ended December 31,
                          ------------------------------------------------

Interest paid               $   42.8         $    37.8         $   34.8
Income taxes paid               51.9              60.7             68.4

   During 1997,  the Company  received  notes  approximating  $98.3 million as a
partial payment on the sale of Incredible  Universe assets. In 1996, the Company
received $30.0 million in AST common stock as partial payment of a $90.0 million
note receivable from AST (see Note 7).

   Capital lease  obligations  of $22.1  million,  $4.4 million and $6.0 million
were  recorded  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  1997,  1996 and  1995,
respectively, for the lease of certain retail stores and equipment.

NOTE 25 - CONTINGENCIES
   Tandy  has  various   claims,   lawsuits,   disputes   with  third   parties,
investigations and pending actions involving allegations of negligence,  product
defects,  discrimination,  infringement of  intellectual  property  rights,  tax
deficiencies,  violations  of permits or  licenses,  and breach of contract  and
other matters against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the operation
of its business.  The liability,  if any,  associated with these matters was not
determinable  at December  31,  1997.  While  certain of these  matters  involve
substantial  amounts, and although occasional adverse settlements or resolutions
may occur and negatively  impact  earnings in the year of settlement,  it is the
opinion of management that their ultimate  resolution will not have a materially
adverse effect on Tandy's financial position.

   Pursuant to the Company's Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement Agreement
(the "Agreement") with O'Sullivan Industries ("O'Sullivan"), a former subsidiary
of Tandy,  the Company  receives  payments  from  O'Sullivan  approximating  the
federal tax benefit that O'Sullivan realizes from the increased tax basis of its
assets  resulting from the initial public  offering  completed in February 1994.
The higher tax basis increases  O'Sullivan's  tax deductions  and,  accordingly,
reduces  income taxes payable by  O'Sullivan.  For the years ended  December 31,
1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company recognized income of $5.8 million, $0.2 million
and $1.3 million, net of tax, respectively, under this Agreement. These payments
will  continue to be made over a 15-year time period,  and are  contingent  upon
O'Sullivan's  level of earnings  from year to year.  The income is recorded as a
reduction of selling,  general and  administrative  expenses in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income.

NOTE 26 - RELATIONS WITH INTERTAN
   InterTAN,  Inc. ("InterTAN"),  the former foreign retail operations of Tandy,
was spun off to Tandy  stockholders  as a  tax-free  dividend  in  fiscal  1987.
Summarized  in the  tables  below are the notes and other  receivables  due from
InterTAN  at  December  31,  1997 and  1996,  as well as the  income  components
generated from operations relative to InterTAN for each of the three years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.

   In August 1993, Trans World  Electronics,  Inc. ("Trans World"), a subsidiary
of  Tandy,  reached  an  agreement  with  InterTAN's  banking  syndicate  to buy
approximately  $42.0  million of  InterTAN's  debt at a  negotiated,  discounted
price. The debt purchased from the banks was restructured into a seven-year note
with  interest  of 8.64%  (the  "Series  A" note).  Trans  World  also  provided
approximately  $10.0  million in working  capital and trade  credit to InterTAN.
Interest  on the  working  capital  loan (the  "Series B" note) of 8.11% was due
semiannually  beginning  February  25,  1994  until the note was paid in full in
1996. On December 30, 1997,  InterTAN  repaid the gross amount of the "Series A"
note in full.  In  consideration  for the  extension of credit,  Trans World had
received  five-year warrants  exercisable for approximately  1,450,000 shares of
InterTAN  common stock.  The warrants were returned to InterTAN in December 1997
upon  repayment of the "Series A" note.  Due to the  repayment of the "Series A"
note in 1997,  the Company  will no longer  receive  interest  income or have an
accretion  of discount  from  InterTAN.  The Company  recognized  a gain of $4.7
million upon  retirement of the "Series A" note equal to the proceeds  recovered
less the net amount of the note  receivable at the date of retirement.  The gain
has been  classified  as a reduction  to SG&A expense in the  accompanying  1997
Consolidated Statements of Income.

   Under the terms of a merchandise  agreement  reached with InterTAN in October
1993, as amended, InterTAN may purchase, on payment terms, certain products sold
or secured by Tandy. A&A International,  Inc. ("A&A"), a subsidiary of Tandy, is
and will continue to be the exclusive  purchasing agent for products originating
in Asia for InterTAN.  A&A receives commission income for this service.  License
agreements,  as amended, also provide a royalty payable to Tandy, which began in
the September 1995 quarter.

NOTE 27 - QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)
   As the Company's operations are predominantly  retail oriented,  its business
is subject to seasonal  fluctuations with the December 31 quarter being the most
significant  in terms of sales and  profits  because  of the  Christmas  selling
season.

   During the quarter ended December 31, 1996, the Company  recognized a FAS 121
charge  and  a  restructuring  charge  of  $86.8  million  and  $136.6  million,
respectively.  In  addition,  gross  profit for the  fourth  quarter of 1996 was
impacted by a lower of cost or market  inventory  impairment  of $91.4  million,
largely  attributable  to  the  restructuring  plan  associated  with  inventory
liquidations for closed stores (see Note 4).

   During the quarter ended December 31, 1997, the Company revised its provision
for store  closings  pursuant to the 1996 store  closure plan and  recognized an
additional  charge of $11.6 million  related to store  closings  pursuant to the
1996 store closure plan.

        are terminated  by the Company,  your rights to receive a  bonus will be
        at the  sole  discretion  of  the  Company  and in such  amount  as  the
        Company  might decide.  If you  retire at age 55 or over,  provided  the
        Company has given its consent to  your early retirement,  or die  before
        the end of the then current fiscal  year, your bonus will be  calculated
        using  actual  results to  the  nearest end of the month  preceding   or
        succeeding  such event,  which  will then be adjusted  using  the latest
        budget  to  include  the  remaining   months  of  the   year.   Example:
        Retirement date  is August 10. Bonus  calculations would  include actual
        results  through July 31 and the  latest  budgeted  numbers  from August
        through December. The bonus calculated, which will be an  annual  bonus,
        will then be  prorated  for the partial  year  worked  i.e.  7/12  times
        annual bonus  calculated in this example.  The Stock   Price  percentage
        will be calculated using only actual  results  to the nearest end of the
        month for this year and last year.  The amount  will  be  paid to you or
        the legal representative of your estate.

VI.     If at any time during your continued  employment,  your  responsibility,
        duties or title changes, this plan is subject to revision or termination
        by the Company at the time of the foregoing change. A partial year bonus
        will be calculated using the methodology set forth in paragraph V.

THIS  AGREEMENT  made  this  2nd day of  October,  1997,  by and  between  Tandy
Corporation,  a corporation  duly  organized and existing  under the laws of the

                                  WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS,  Executive  is the  ____________________  of  Tandy  and  receives
certain compensation from Tandy;

WHEREAS,  Executive  desires  to defer  the  receipt  of a  portion  of his

NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises  and of the  promises  and
covenants  hereinafter contained and for the purposes herein stated, the parties
hereto do hereby agree as follows:

Executive shall relinquish to Tandy _____ shares of Tandy  common stock that are
designated to vest on January 2, 1998 under a Restricted  Stock  Agreement dated
January 2, 1996 between  Executive and Tandy;  and  thereafter,  Executive shall
have no rights with respect to such common stock.

Deferred Compensation Account.

      Committee")  to take into  account any  recapitalization,  reorganization,
      merger, stock split, stock dividend or other changes in Tandy common stock
      from the date of this  Agreement  until the date the Shares are  delivered
      under the terms hereof.

Investment of Deferred Compensation Account.
- -------------------------------------------

1.    Other than with respect to the Shares,  Tandy shall  invest,  from time to
      time, an amount of its assets equal to the remaining value of the Deferred
      Compensation Account in such mutual funds, stocks, bonds,  securities,  or
      other  investments as may be selected by Executive in his sole discretion,
      provided  that  no  portion  of  the  remaining   value  or  Tandy  assets
      attributable thereto may be invested in Tandy common or preferred stock.

2.    Any earnings,  gains, or losses  (realized or unrealized)  associated with
      the   investment  of  such  assets  shall  be  credited  to  the  Deferred
      Compensation Account.

3.    Executive  agrees on behalf of himself and his  beneficiary  to assume all
      risk,  loss,  cost or expense in connection with any decrease in the value
      of the Deferred Compensation Account.

4.    Executive and his beneficiary shall have no property interest whatsoever 
      in any specific assets of Tandy.

Payment of Deferred Compensation.
- --------------------------------

1.    Except as  otherwise  provided  herein,  Tandy shall pay to Executive in a
      single sum the amount  credited to the  Deferred  Compensation  Account on
      January 2, 2002.

      Executive may, on or before December 31, 2000, elect in writing to receive
      the amount credited to the Deferred  Compensation Account in more than one
      annual  installment,  but no more than ten annual  installments,  provided
      that payment shall not begin prior to January 2, 2002. If Executive  shall
      die  prior  to  the  payment  of any  amount  remaining  in  the  Deferred
      Compensation  Account,  then such amount shall be paid in cash and Shares,
      as the case may be, in a single payment to his  beneficiary or estate,  as
      the case may be.

2.    Prior to the commencement of benefits under this Agreement,  the Executive
      may request a  distribution due to a Hardship (as defined  below).  If the
      Executive  has  commenced  to  receive  installment  payments  under  this
      Agreement, he may request  acceleration of such payments in the event of a
      Hardship.   The  Executive  may   request   a   Hardship  distribution  or
      acceleration by submitting  a   written  request  to  the O & C  Committee
      accompanied  by  evidence   to  demonstrate that the  circumstances  being
      experienced qualify as a Hardship. The O & C Committee  shall, in its sole
      discretion,  determine whether the Executive  has  experienced a Hardship.
      Any  distribution  on account of Hardship shall be limited   to  an amount
      sufficient to meet the Hardship.

      For purposes of this Agreement,  a Hardship is an immediate financial need
      of  the  Executive   resulting  from   extraordinary   and   unforeseeable
      circumstances  arising  as a result of events  beyond  the  control of the
      Executive.

3.    Any amounts credited to the Deferred Compensation Account shall be paid as
      follows:

      (a)  Distribution  of the Shares  credited  to the  Deferred  Compensation
           Account as of January 2, 1998 shall be paid solely in shares of Tandy
           common stock; and

      (b)  Distribution of the remaining value shall be paid in cash.

Beneficiary.  The beneficiary under this Agreement shall be Executive's  spouse.
- -----------
If Executive's spouse predeceases the Executive or dies  simultaneously with the
Executive,  then the  beneficiary  under  this  Agreement  shall be  Executive's
estate.  Executive may change the beneficiary  under this Agreement by notifying
Tandy's General Counsel in writing.

1.    Nothing  contained in this  Agreement and no action taken pursuant to the 
      provisions of this  Agreement  shall  create  or be construed to create a 
      trust of any kind,or a fiduciary relationship between Tandy and Executive,
      his  beneficiary  or any other person.  Any amounts which may be invested
      or credited under the  provisions of this  Agreement  shall  continue for 
      all purposes to be a part of the general assets of Tandy and no person or
      entity,  other than Tandy,  shall by  virtue  of  the  provisions of this
      Agreement have any interest in such amounts. To the extent that any person
      or entity acquires a right to receive  payments  or  the  delivery  of the
      Shares from Tandy under this  Agreement,  such right shall  be  no greater
      than the right of any unsecured general creditor of Tandy.

2.    Notwithstanding  the above,  Executive in his sole  discretion may require
      that Tandy create, at Tandy's expense,  a grantor trust (commonly referred
      to as a rabbi trust).  If a grantor trust is created,  Tandy shall deposit
      the assets allocated to the Deferred  Compensation Account into the trust.
      The assets of the grantor trust shall be subject  solely to the bankruptcy
      or insolvency creditors of Tandy.

Assignment or Alienation of Benefits. The right of Executive or any other person
- ------------------------------------
to the  payment  of  benefits  under  this  Agreement  shall  not  be  assigned,
alienated,  transferred,  pledged or encumbered except by will or by the laws of
descent and distribution.

1.    Nothing  contained  herein shall be construed as conferring upon Executive
      the right to continue in the employ of Tandy in any capacity.

2.    The O & C Committee  shall  have  full  power  and authority to interpret,
      construe,   and  administer   this   Agreement.    The  O & C  Committee's
      interpretation  and construction  of  this  Agreement,   and  its  actions
      hereunder,  including any valuation  of the Deferred  Compensation Account
      or the amount  of  the  payment or the identity  of  the  recipient of the
      payment to be made therefrom,  shall  be  binding and  conclusive  on  all
      persons for all  purposes.  No employee of Tandy or member of the Board of
      Directors  of Tandy shall be liable to any person for any  action taken or
      omitted in connection with the  interpretation and  administration of this
      Agreement  unless  attributable to his own willful  misconduct  or lack of
      good faith.

3.    This  Agreement  shall be binding  upon and inure to the benefit of Tandy,
      its  successors  and  assigns,  and  Executive  and his heirs,  executors,
      administrators, and legal representatives.

4.    This Agreement  shall be construed in accordance  with and governed by the
      law of the State of Texas, and venue for any actions  hereunder or related

      Executive,  his  beneficiary  or any other person.  Any amounts which  may
      be invested or credited under  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement  shall
      continue for all purposes to be a part of the general assets of  Tandy and
      no person or entity,  other than Tandy,  shall by virtue of the provisions
      of this Agreement have any interest in such amounts.  To  the extent  that
      any person or entity acquires a right to receive  payments or the delivery
      of the Shares from Tandy under this  Agreement,  such  right  shall  be no
      greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of Tandy.

      liable to any person for any action  taken or omitted in  connection  with
      the   interpretation   and   administration   of  this  Agreement   unless

   1.     Executive  hereby elects that payment of his vested benefit  hereunder
          will begin (circle and complete the applicable election):

          (a)    on the first  business  day of  February  coincident  with,  or
                 immediately  following,  Executive's  termination of employment
                 with Tandy;
          (b)    on the first business day of February _____, (fill in year); or
                 (c) on the earlier of "A" or "B".

          Executive hereby elects that his payment,  as described above, will be
          made  in the  following  form  (circle  and  complete  the  applicable
          election):

          (a)    single sum; or
          (b)    ___annual installments (not to exceed 10).

          Executive's payment election shall be irrevocable except that if above
          Executive  elects  payment  in the form of a single  sum,  then he may
          change such election to an election for periodic  payments,  provided,
          however, that such periodic payments commence on the same day that the
          single sum would have been paid and that such election change is filed
          with the  Organization  and  Compensation  Committee  of the  Board of
          Directors of Tandy (the "0 & C Committee") at least 12 months prior to
          the day  payment  of the  single  sum was to be made.  This  change in
          election may be made only once.

          Notwithstanding  the  election  above,  if this  paragraph is checked,
          Executive   hereby  elects  that  if  his  employment  with  Tandy  is
          involuntarily terminated,  Executive shall receive in a single sum all
          the benefits due him under this  paragraph on the last business day of
          the month immediately  following the month in which his termination of
          employment occurs.

   2.     After   Executive's   death  any  amount  remaining  in  the  Deferred
          Compensation Account shall be paid in a single sum to his beneficiary,
          as soon as  administratively  feasible in the calendar year  following
          the calendar year of Executive's death.

   3.     Prior  to  the  commencement  of  benefits  under  this  Agreement,   
          Executive  may  request  a distribution  due to a Hardship (as defined
          below).  If  Executive has  commenced  to receive installment payments
          under this Agreement,  he may request acceleration of such payments in
          the event  of a  Hardship.  Executive  may  request  a  Hardship  
          distribution  or  acceleration  by submitting a written request to the
          0 & C Committee  accompanied  by  evidence to  demonstrate that the 
          circumstances  being experienced  qualify as a Hardship.  The 0 & C 
          Committee shall, in its sole discretion,  determine whether  Executive
          has experienced a Hardship.  Any distribution on account of  Hardship
          shall be  limited  to the  lesser of an amount  sufficient to meet the
          Hardship or the vested balance of Executive's Deferred Compensation
          Account.

          For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  a  Hardship  is  an  immediate
          financial  need  of  Executive   resulting  from   extraordinary   and
          unforeseeable  circumstances  arising as a result of events beyond the
          control of Executive.

   4.     In the event of Executive's Disability, Executive's benefit under this
          Agreement  shall be paid to him (or his legal  representative)  in the
          manner  prescribed  by the 0 & C  Committee  in its  sole  discretion.
          "Disability"  means a  physical  or mental  infirmity  which the 0 & C
          Committee, in its sole discretion,  has determined impairs Executive's
          ability  to  perform  substantially  his  duties  for a period  of one
          hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.

   5.     Any amounts credited to the Deferred Compensation Account shall be 
          paid as follows:

          (a)  Distribution  of the  Stock  Units  credited  to  the  Deferred
               Compensation  Account  shall be paid  solely in shares of Tandy
               Common Stock; and
          (b)  Distribution of any fractional shares shall be paid in cash.

   6.     In the event  that  Tandy  would be  denied a  deduction  for  amounts
          otherwise  payable  in any  calendar  year  to  Executive  under  this
          Agreement  by  reason  of the  application  of  section  162(m) of the
          Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the 0 & C Committee, in its
          sole  discretion,  may reduce any payment  otherwise  due to Executive
          (but not below zero) to the extent necessary to avoid such application
          of section  162(m) and such amount not paid shall be paid to Executive
          in the earliest  calendar year(s) in which payment may be made without
          application of section 162(m).

   7.     Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary in this  Agreement,  if a 
          "Change in  'Control"  (as defined  in the  Tandy  Corporation  1997
          Incentive  Stock  Plan)  of  Tandy  occurs,  then (a) effective on the
          date of the Change in  Control,  all  amounts credited  under this  
          Agreement shall  become  vested and  nonforfeitable, (b)  effective on
          the date of the Change in Control, all  deferral  elections  shall
          become  null and void and no more  deferrals  shall be accepted under
          this  Agreement,  and (c) within two weeks of the date of the Change 
          in Control,  Tandy or its  successor  shall pay to  Executive  in a
          single  sum the value of his  benefits  under this Agreement.

   Beneficiary.  The  beneficiary  under  this  Agreement  shall be  Executive's
   -----------   
   spouse. If Executive's  spouse predeceases  Executive or dies  simultaneously
   with  Executive,   then  the  beneficiary   under  this  Agreement  shall  be
   Executive's estate. Executive may change the beneficiary under this Agreement
   by notifying Tandy's General Counsel in writing.

   Funding.
   -------
   1.    Nothing  contained in this  Agreement  and no action taken  pursuant to
         the  provisions  of this Agreement  shall  create  or be  construed  to
         create  a  trust  of  any  kind,  or a  fiduciary relationship between 
         Tandy and Executive,  his beneficiary or any other person. Any amounts 
         which may be invested  or credited  under the  provisions  of this 
         Agreement shall  continue  for all purposes to be a part of the general
         assets of Tandy and no person or entity,  other than Tandy, shall by
         virtue of the  provisions of this  Agreement  have any interest in such
         amounts.  To the extent  that any person or entity  acquires a right to
         receive  payments  or the  delivery of the shares of Common Stock from
         Tandy under this  Agreement,  such right shall be no greater than the
         right of any unsecured general creditor of Tandy.

   2.    Notwithstanding the above, Executive in his sole discretion may require
         that Tandy create, at Tandy's expense, a grantor trust (commonly 
         referred to as a rabbi trust). If a grantor trust is created,  Tandy
         shall deposit the assets allocated to the Deferred Compensation Account
         into the trust. The assets of the grantor trust shall be subject solely
         to the  bankruptcy or insolvency creditors of Tandy.

Assignment or Alienation of Benefits. The right of Executive or any other person
- ------------------------------------
to the  payment  of  benefits  under  this  Agreement  shall  not  be  assigned,
alienated,  transferred,  pledged or encumbered except by will or by the laws of
descent and distribution.

Miscellaneous.
- -------------
1.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring upon Executive the
    right to continue in the employ of Tandy in any capacity.

2.  The O & C Committee  shall have full power and authority to  interpret,  
    construe,  and  administer this Agreement.  The O & C Committee's 
    interpretation and construction of this Agreement, and its actions 
    hereunder,  including any valuation of the Deferred  Compensation  Account
    or the amount of the payment or the identity of the recipient of the payment
    to be made therefrom,  shall be binding and  conclusive  on all  persons for
    all  purposes.  No employee of Tandy or member of the Board of Directors  of
    Tandy  shall be liable to any person for any  action  taken or omitted in 
    connection with the  interpretation  and  administration  of this  Agreement
    unless  attributable  to his own willful misconduct or lack of good faith.

3.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Tandy,  its
    successors   and  assigns,   and   Executive   and  his  heirs,   executors,
    administrators, and legal representatives.

4.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law
    of the State of Texas,  and venue for any  actions  hereunder  or related to
    this Agreement shall be in Tarrant County, Texas.

5.  The Stock  Units  credited to the  Deferred  Compensation  Account  shall be
    equitably  adjusted  by  the  0 & C  Committee  to  take  into  account  any
    recapitalization,  reorganization,  merger,  stock split,  stock dividend or
    other  changes in Tandy Common Stock from the date of this  Agreement  until
    the date the shares of Common Stock are delivered under the terms hereof.

        in any specific assets of Tandy.

Payment of Deferred Compensation.
- --------------------------------
1.      Executive  hereby  elects that payment of his vested  benefit  hereunder
        will begin (circle and complete the applicable election):

        (a)    on  the  first  business  day of  February  coincident  with,  or
               immediately following, Executive's termination of employment with
               Tandy;
        (b)    on the first business day of February, _____ (fill in year); or 
        (c)    on the earlier of "A" or "B".

        Executive hereby elects that his payment,  as described  above,  will be
        made  in  the  following   form  (circle  and  complete  the  applicable
        election):

        (a)    single sum; or
        (b)    _______annual installments (not to exceed 10).

        Executive's  payment election shall be irrevocable  except that if above
        Executive elects payment in the form of a single sum, then he may change
        such election to an election for periodic payments,  provided,  however,
        that such periodic payments commence on the same day that the single sum
        would  have been paid and that such  election  change is filed  with the
        Organization  and  Compensation  Committee  of the Board of Directors of
        Tandy  (the "0 & C  Committee")  at  least  12  months  prior to the day
        payment of the single sum was to be made. This change in election may be
        made only once.

        _______  Notwithstanding  the  election  above,  if  this  paragraph  is
        checked,  Executive  hereby elects that if his employment  with Tandy is
        involuntarily  terminated,  Executive  shall receive in a single sum all
        the  benefits due him under this  paragraph on the last  business day of
        the month  immediately  following the month in which his  termination of
        employment occurs.

2.      After   Executive's   death  any  amount   remaining   in  the  Deferred
        Compensation  Account shall be paid in a single sum to his  beneficiary,
        as soon as administratively  feasible in the calendar year following the
        calendar year of Executive's death.

3.      Prior  to  the  commencement  of  benefits  under  this  Agreement,  
        Executive  may  request  a distribution  due to a Hardship  (as defined
        below).  If  Executive  has  commenced to receive installment payments
        under this Agreement,  he may request acceleration of such payments in 
        the event of a  Hardship.  Executive  may  request  a  Hardship  
        distribution  or  acceleration  by submitting  a written  request to the
        0 & C Committee  accompanied  by evidence to  demonstrate that the
        circumstances being experienced  qualify as a Hardship.  The 0 & C
        Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether Executive has
        experienced a Hardship.  Any distribution on account of Hardship shall
        be limited to an amount sufficient to meet the Hardship.

        For purposes of this  Agreement,  a Hardship is an  immediate  financial
        need  of  Executive   resulting  from  extraordinary  and  unforeseeable
        circumstances  arising  as a result  of events  beyond  the  control  of
        Executive.

4.      Any time prior to the date elected by Executive  for payment  hereunder,
        Executive  may  elect to  receive  in a single  sum 94% of the  Deferred
        Compensation  Account not invested in Stock Units.  Upon receipt of this
        amount,  Executive  shall  forfeit  the  remaining  6% of  the  Deferred
        Compensation Account not invested in Stock Units.

5.      In the event of Executive's  Disability,  Executive's benefit under this
        Agreement  shall  be paid to him (or his  legal  representative)  in the
        manner  prescribed  by  the 0 & C  Committee  in  its  sole  discretion.
        "Disability"  means a  physical  or  mental  infirmity  which  the 0 & C
        Committee,  in its sole discretion,  has determined impairs  Executive's
        ability to perform  substantially his duties for a period of one hundred
        eighty (180) consecutive days.

6.      Any amounts credited to the Deferred Compensation  Account shall be paid
        as follows:

        (a)    Distribution of the amounts credited to the Deferred Compensation
               Account  with  respect  to Stock  Units  shall be paid  solely in
               shares of Common Stock; and
        (b)    Distribution of any fractional shares or any other benefits shall
               be paid in cash

7.      In the  event  that  Tandy  would be  denied  a  deduction  for  amounts
        otherwise payable in any calendar year to Executive under this Agreement
        by reason of the  application of section 162(m) of the Internal  Revenue
        Code of 1986, as amended,  the 0 & C Committee,  in its sole discretion,
        may reduce any payment  otherwise due to Executive  (but not below zero)
        to the extent  necessary to avoid such application of section 162(m) and
        such amount not paid shall be paid to Executive in the earliest calendar
        year(s) in which  payment  may be made  without  application  of section
        162(m).

8.      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a "Change
        in Control" (as defined in the Tandy  Corporation  1997 Incentive  Stock
        Plan) of Tandy  occurs,  then (a) effective on the date of the Change in
        Control,  all deferral  elections shall become null and void and no more
        deferrals  shall be  accepted  under this  Agreement  and (b) within two
        weeks of the date of the Change in Control, Tandy or its successor shall
        pay to Executive  in a single sum the value of his  benefits  under this
        Agreement.

Beneficiary.  The beneficiary under this Agreement shall be Executive's  spouse.
- -----------
If  Executive's  spouse  predeceases   Executive  or  dies  simultaneously  with
Executive,  then the  beneficiary  under  this  Agreement  shall be  Executive's
estate.  Executive may change the beneficiary  under this Agreement by notifying
Tandy's General Counsel in writing.

Funding.
- -------
1.      Nothing  contained in this  Agreement  and no action taken  pursuant to
        the  provisions of this Agreement  shall  create  or be  construed  to 
        create  a trust  of any  kind,  or a  fiduciary relationship  between
        Tandy and Executive,  his  beneficiary  or any other person. Any amounts
        which may be invested or credited under the provisions of this Agreement
        shall continue for all  purposes to be a part of the general  assets of
        Tandy and no person or entity,  other than Tandy,  shall by virtue of
        the  provisions of this Agreement have any interest in such amounts.  To
        the extent that any person or entity  acquires a right to receive  
        payments or the  delivery of the shares of Common Stock from Tandy under
        this  Agreement,  such right shall be no greater than the right of any 
        unsecured general creditor of Tandy.

2.      Notwithstanding the above,  Executive in his sole discretion may require
        that  Tandy  create,  at  Tandy's  expense,  a grantor  trust  (commonly

        Participant  under  this  Article  IX by reason of the  application  of
        section  162(m) of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended,

Miscellaneous

        may, but need not, be used to pay benefits hereunder.

14.2    No Right to Continued  Employment.  Participation  in the Plan shall not
        ---------------------------------
        give any  employee  any right to remain in the employ of the  Company or

        governed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas,
        without  reference to rules relating to conflicts of law,  except to the
        extent  preempted by federal law. Any action  arising out of or relating
        to the Plan, the Company,  Participants,  or any  transaction  under the
        Plan  shall be brought  in state or  federal  courts  located in Tarrant
        County, Texas.

14.5    Compliance with Other Laws. The Committee may, from time to time, impose
        --------------------------
        additional   restrictions  upon  Participants  as  it  deems  necessary,
        advisable or appropriate in order to comply with applicable  federal and
        state securities laws, or other federal laws.

                                TANDY CORPORATION
                       UNFUNDED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                                  FOR DIRECTORS
                    (AS AMENDED AND RESTATED JANUARY 1, 1998)
                    -----------------------------------------

1.      PURPOSES OF THE PLAN
        --------------------
        a) The purposes of the unfunded Deferred  Compensation Plan (the "Plan")
           are to enable Tandy Corporation (the "Company") to attract and retain
           the best  qualified  members of the Board of Directors of the Company
           (a  "Director") by providing them with a Plan to defer the payment of
           all or a specified  portion of the fees  payable to the  Director for
           services rendered on behalf of the Company.

2.      ELECTION TO DEFER
        -----------------
        a) A Director may elect on or before  December 31 of any year,  to defer
           payment of all or a specified part of all his/her director fees (cash
           or Common  Stock of the Company or dividends  attributable  thereto),
           for services  during the  succeeding  calendar  year  following  such
           election.  Any person who shall become a Director during any calendar
           year,  and who was not a Director  of the  Company  on the  preceding
           December 31, may elect,  not later than the 30th day after his or her
           term begins, to defer payment of all or a specified part of such fees
           for the succeeding calendar year. Any such elections shall be made by
           written notice  delivered to the Corporate  Secretary of the Company.
           Any  such  elections  shall  only be  effective  for  the  succeeding
           calendar year. Notwithstanding the above, for the calendar year 1998,
           any such election must be made prior to February 28, 1998.

        b) Amounts deferred under this Plan will be distributed  based on one of
           the two following elections made by each participating Director:

           (1) consecutive  substantially  equal  annual  installments  up  to a
               maximum of ten in advance  beginning on January 15 of a specified
               year; or

           (2) a lump sum payment on a specified date not in excess of ten years
               from the date Director ceases to be a Director.

3.      DIRECTORS' ACCOUNTS
        -------------------
        a) Cash Account
           ------------
           All deferred  cash fees shall be recorded on the books of the Company
           and  a  memorandum   cash  account  of  the  fees  deferred  by  each
           participating Director will be maintained.

        b) Stock Account
           -------------
           All deferred  fees  payable in Common Stock of the Company ("Company
           Common  Stock")  shall be  recorded on the books of the Company and a
           memorandum stock account of the fees in Company Common Stock deferred
           by each  participating  Director will be  maintained.  The Director's
           stock  account shall be credited with the number of shares of Company
           Common Stock otherwise payable to each  participating  Director under
           the  terms  and in the  amounts  and on the  dates  set  forth in the
           Company's  1993 Incentive  Stock Plan, as amended,  and the Company's
           1997 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended,  as the case may be, providing
           for the  compensation  of  Directors,  if they so elect,  in  Company
           Common Stock.

           If a  Director's  stock  account is  credited  with shares of Company
           Common  Stock by reason of a deferral  of  director  fees on or after
           January 1, 1998,  and payment of all of the Company  Common  Stock is
           deferred (a) until after  December  31st of the third  calendar  year
           which  follows the  calendar  year during  which such  deferrals  are
           initially made or (b) until after the earlier of (i) December 31st of
           such third calendar year or (ii) the day the Director  ceases to be a
           director,  the  Director's  stock  account  shall be credited with an
           additional  number of  shares  of  Company  Common  Stock  (including
           fractions  thereof)  equal to  twenty-five  percent  of the shares of
           Company Common Stock initially credited.

        c) Pension Plan Stock Account
           --------------------------
           Effective  December  31,  1997,  the  Special  Compensation  Plan for
           Directors (the "Pension  Plan") was terminated and in terminating the
           Pension Plan the Company  calculated  the single sum present value of
           each Pension Plan participant's  benefit and converted that amount to
           Company  Common  Stock based on the average of the closing  prices of
           Company Common Stock for 1997. The amount of the Company Common Stock
           shall be  recorded  on the  books  of the  Company  and a  memorandum
           account   reflecting   such  amounts  for  each   Director   formerly
           participating  in the Pension Plan will be  maintained  (the "Pension
           Plan Stock Account").

4.      PAYMENT FROM DIRECTORS' ACCOUNTS
        --------------------------------
        a) Payment of the amount of deferred  fees of a Director's  cash account
           shall be made in cash.  Payment of the amount of  deferred  fees of a
           Director's  stock account or Pension Plan Stock Account shall be made
           in Company Common Stock.  Fractional  Company Common Stock interests,
           if any, and dividends  attributable  to Company Common Stock shall be
           payable in cash. Each participating  Director holding a stock account
           or Pension Plan Stock Account, upon his or her election, shall either
           be directly paid in cash or have his or her cash account  credited as
           of the  payment  date for  dividends  on Company  Common  Stock in an
           amount  equal to  dividends  attributable  to the number of shares of
           Company  Common Stock  credited to each  Director's  stock account or
           Pension Plan Stock  Account as of the record date set by the Board of
           Directors of the Company.

       b)  The aggregate amount of deferred fees, together with interest accrued
           thereon,  credited to the  account of any  Director,  at the election
           of the  Director,  shall  be  paid to the Director,  either  (i) in a
           lump  sum   on   the date  specified  by the  Director, or (ii) in
           substantially  equal annual  installments  not exceeding ten or (iii)
           in a lump sum, upon a Change in  Control  or  threatened  Change in
           Control  (as  hereafter  defined),  on a date specified  by the Board
           of  Directors  prior  to any  Change  in  Control,  or  (iv) if no
           election is made,  on 60 days  following  the date a Director  ceases
           to be a Director.  The first installment shall be paid (i) in advance
           on  January  15 of the  following  calendar year  in  which  the 
           Director  ceases  to be a  Director  of  the  Company and  subsequent
           installments  (not  exceeding  nine)  shall be paid  promptly  on
           January 15 of each of the succeeding calendar years, or (ii) on the 
           date specified by the Director.

       c)  Any Director  with a Pension Plan Stock  Account shall be entitled to
           make an election as to the method of payment of Company  Common Stock
           from his or her Pension  Plan Stock  Account. Such  election must be
           made prior to April 1, 1998. In such  election,  each Director  shall
           elect the method of payment  (either single payment or 10 or less 
           annual  installments)  and the date such  payment will be made or 
           begin to be made.  If any Director does not elect a method of payment
           or a date of such  payment,  then the  amount of such  Director's 
           Pension Plan Stock Account shall be  distributed  to him or her, in a
           single sum, 60 days  following the day the individual ceases to be a
           Director.

           For  purposes of the Plan a "Change in  Control"  shall have the same
           meaning as set forth in the Tandy  Corporation  1993 Incentive  Stock
           Plan as amended.

5.     INTEREST
       --------
       a)  On the last day of each calendar  quarter  interest shall be credited
           to each Director's  cash account  calculated on the unpaid balance in
           such cash account as calculated from time to time during the quarter.
           The rate of interest  to be  credited  will be 1% per annum less than
           the announced prime rate of the Chase-Chemical  Bank N.A. as the same
           shall exist from time to time during the quarter.

6.      PAYMENT IN EVENT OF DEATH
        -------------------------
        a) If a Director should die before all deferred  amounts credited to the
           Director's cash account,  stock account or Pension Plan Stock Account
           have been distributed, the balance of any deferred fees, dividends if
           any,  and  interest  then in the  Director's  account  shall  be paid
           promptly  to the  Director's  designated  beneficiary  in the  manner
           designated by the Director or if no method is selected within 60 days
           after the  Director's  death.  If such  Director did not  designate a
           beneficiary  or in the event that the  beneficiary  or  beneficiaries
           designated by such Director shall have predeceased the Director,  the
           balance  in the  Director's  account  shall be paid  promptly  to the
           Director's estate.

 7.     TERMINATION OF ELECTION
        -----------------------
        a) A Director may  terminate  his  election to defer  payment of fees by
           written notice  delivered to the Corporate  Secretary of the Company.
           Such termination shall become effective as of the end of the calendar
           year in which  notice of  termination  is given with  respect to fees
           payable for services as a Director during subsequent  calendar years.
           Amounts  credited to the account of a Director prior to the effective
           date of termination  shall not be affected  thereby and shall be paid
           only in accordance with Sections 4 and 6 above.

 8.     RIGHTS UNSECURED
        ----------------
        a) The right of any  Director  to receive  payment of  deferred  amounts
           under the provisions of the Plan shall be an unsecured  claim against
           the general  assets of the Company.  The  maintenance  of  individual
           Director  accounts is for  bookkeeping  purposes only. The Company is
           not obligated to acquire or set aside any  particular  assets for the
           discharge  of its  obligations,  nor  shall  any  Director  have  any
           property rights in any particular assets held by the Company, whether
           or not held for the  purpose of  funding  the  Company's  obligations
           hereunder.

 9.     NONASSIGNABILITY
        ----------------
        a) During  the  Director's  lifetime,  the right to any  deferred  fees,
           dividends  if any,  and  interest  thereon  may  not be  transferred,
           assigned,  hypothecated  or pledged.  Any such  attempt to  transfer,
           assign, hypothecate or pledge the account shall be void.

 10.    INTERPRETATION AND AMENDMENT
        ----------------------------
        a) The Plan shall be administered by the Corporate  Governance Committee
           of the Company.  The decision of such  Committee  with respect to any
           questions arising as to the  interpretation  of this Plan,  including
           the severability of any and all of the provisions  thereof,  shall be
           final,  conclusive  and  binding.  The Company  reserves the right to
           modify  this Plan from time to time or to repeal  the Plan  entirely,
           provided, however, that no modification of this Plan shall operate to
           annul an election  already in effect for the current calendar year or
           any preceding calendar year.

11.     EFFECTIVE DATE
        --------------
        a) The effective  date of this Plan will be December 15, 1995 when it
           was adopted.

     This schedule contains the restated summary financial  information of Tandy
Corporation for the periods noted. Only the (EPS-PRIMARY) and (EPS-DILUTED) tags

principle,  specifically  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 128,
