    ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

    GENERAL
         The Company engages in the retail sale of consumer
    electronics including personal computers primarily in the
    United States.  The Company's retail operations include the
    Radio Shack, McDuff Electronics, VideoConcepts, The Edge in
    Electronics, Computer City and Incredible Universe store
    chains as well as some new concepts which it is testing.
    These new test concepts are Famous Brand Electronics
    Warehouse, Energy Express Plus and Audio Video & Computers.

              Radio Shack.  Radio Shack is the Company's largest
         operating division.  At December 31, 1993, Radio Shack
         had 4,553 company-owned stores located throughout the
         United States.  These stores average approximately
         2,370 square feet in area and are located in major
         malls, strip centers and individual store fronts,
         primarily in metropolitan markets.  To provide service
         to smaller communities, Radio Shack had on the same date
         a network of 2,002 dealer/franchise stores.  The dealers
         are generally engaged in other retail operations and
         augment their sales with Radio Shack products.  In
         addition, Radio Shack had 65 international dealers at
         December 31, 1993.

              The 4,553 company-owned stores carry a broad
         assortment of electronic parts and accessories,
         audio/video equipment, cellular and conventional
         telephones as well as specialized products such as
         scanners, electronic toys and personal computers.  The
         personal computers offered through these consumer stores
         primarily target entry level users seeking computers for
         home, individual and small business use.

              Tandy Name Brand Retail Group.  The Tandy Name
         Brand Retail Group is comprised of VideoConcepts, McDuff
         Electronics and The Edge in Electronics retail outlets.
         At December 31, 1993, this group operated a total of 322
         stores which sell name brand televisions, audio
         equipment, personal computers and other electronic
         products and appliances.

              The Tandy Name Brand Retail Group operates two
         distinctly different types of store formats -- mall
         stores and supercenters. The 231 mall stores average
         3,100 square feet in size while the 75 supercenters,
         which are located in stand-alone or strip center
         locations, average 12,200 square feet.  Mall stores sell
         primarily electronic, audio and video products.  The
         supercenter product offerings also include major
         appliances.

              The Company closed approximately 110 Tandy Name
         Brand Retail Group stores in the first quarter of 1993.
         See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
         Operations and Financial Condition" found in Item 7 and
         Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
         for more information.

              "The Edge in Electronics" began operating in 1990.
         This chain of electronic boutique stores is designed for
         mall customers interested in fashionable personal and
         portable name brand electronics.  As of December 31,
         1993, these 16 stores were located in major malls and
         averaged approximately 1,100 square feet.

              Computer City.  As of December 31, 1993, the
         Company had 40 Computer City stores open, three of which
         were in Europe.  The Computer City chain operates as a
         supercenter format featuring many name brand computers,
         software and related products, including U. S. Logic,
         Tandy, IBM, Apple, Sony, Lotus, Borland, Microsoft,
         Packard-Bell, Compaq, AST and Hewlett-Packard.  These
         stores average about 23,500 square feet and carry more
         than 5,000 products.  The Company has opened two new
         stores since December 31, 1993 and plans to open an
         additional 22 stores later in 1994.

              Incredible Universe.  In August 1993 Incredible
         Universe became a separate division of Tandy.  At
         December 31, 1993, Tandy operated three Incredible
         Universe stores: one in Portland, Oregon; a second in
         Arlington, Texas; and a third store located in northeast
         Dallas, Texas.  These 160,000 to 200,000 square foot
         stores offer a broad selection of consumer electronics
         and appliances.  The Company recently opened its fourth
         store in Miami, Florida, and announced plans to open
         stores in Tempe, Arizona; Columbus, Ohio; Sacramento,
         California and Hollywood, Florida.  In addition, more
         Incredible Universe stores are currently planned for
         1994 and 1995.

         Supporting the retail operations is an extensive
         infrastructure that includes:

              A&A International, Inc. - This wholly owned
         subsidiary of the Company serves the wide-ranging
         international import/export, sourcing, evaluation,
         logistics and quality control needs of the Company.
         InterTAN Inc. is the largest outside customer of the
         Company.  Most of A&A's activity for InterTAN originates
         from manufacturers in the Far East.  For more discussion
         on InterTAN see Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated
         Financial Statements.

              Tandy Service Centers - The Company maintains a
         large service and support network in the consumer
         electronics retail industry.  These centers repair name
         brand and private label products sold through all of the
         Company's retail distribution channels.  Over one
         million parts are stocked in the Tandy Service division
         which includes 116 service centers throughout the
         nation.

              Regional Distribution Centers - The 14 distribution
         centers ship over one million cartons each month to both
         Radio Shack and the Tandy Name Brand Retail Group
         operations.  This group will also be instrumental in
         supporting the new Radio Shack Gift Express service.

              Tandy Information Services - TIS collects
         information from the retail stores nationwide and
         updates a large database with sales information.  This
         database is a sophisticated marketing tool benefiting
         every phase of the Company's operations.  TIS also
         processes the inventory, accounting, payroll,
         telecommunications and operating information for all of
         the Company's operations.  In addition, specialized
         information is tracked for the Company's distribution
         and corporate activities.

              Tandy Credit Corporation - This operation, a wholly
         owned subsidiary of the Company, helps support sales of
         the Company's retail operations and provides retail
         divisions additional marketing flexibility through the
         utilization of credit promotions.  This group maintains
         and manages Tandy's various private label credit
         cards.

              Tandy Transportation, Inc. - A large fleet of
         tractors and trailers transports much of the merchandise
         from the ports of entry to the Company's regional
         distribution centers and local distribution facilities
         for delivery to Radio Shack and Tandy Name Brand Retail
         Group stores.

              Consumer Electronics Manufacturing - The Company
         also engages in the manufacturing business with 11
         manufacturing facilities in the United States and
         three overseas manufacturing operations in China, Hong
         Kong and Taiwan.  The China operation is a joint
         venture.  These 14 manufacturing facilities cover a
         total of 1,674,000 square feet and employ over 4,700
         workers and professionals as of December 31, 1993,
         excluding those persons working at facilities included
         in discontinued operations.  The Company continues to
         manufacture a variety of products for use in its
         consumer electronics retailing operations.  The products
         include audio, video, telephony, antennas, wire and
         cable products and a wide variety of hard to find parts
         for consumer electronic products.  Most of the Company's
         manufacturing output is sold through the Radio Shack
         store chain.  In addition, the Company has previously
         operated several related marketing businesses that
         manufacture and sell consumer electronics and computers
         to retailers and end users, see "Discontinued
         Operations" below for further information.

    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
         On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy
    adopted a formal plan of divestiture under which it would
    sell its computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the
    O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ready-to-assemble furniture
    manufacturing and related marketing business, the Memtek
    Products division and the Lika printed circuit board
    business.  The divestiture plan replaced the Company's plan
    to spin off all of the Company's manufacturing and marketing
    businesses as described in Tandy's Transition Report on Form
    10-K/A-4 for the six-month period ended December 31, 1992. 
    In connection with the plan of divestiture the Company
    accounted for the divestiture of these businesses as
    discontinued operations.  Prior year results of operations
    have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued operations
    treatment.

              Computer Manufacturing.  In furtherance of the
         divestiture plan, the Company closed the sale of the
         computer manufacturing and marketing businesses
         to AST Research, Inc. ("AST") on July 13, 1993.  In
         accordance with the terms of the definitive agreement
         between Tandy and AST, Tandy received $15,000,000 upon
         closing of the sale.  The balance of the purchase price
         of $90,000,000 (as adjusted post-closing based on the
         results of an audit of the assets and liabilities
         conveyed) is payable by a promissory note.  The
         promissory note is payable in three years and interest
         is accrued and paid annually.  The interest rate on the
         promissory note is currently 3.75% per annum and is
         adjusted annually, not to exceed 5% per annum.  The
         terms of the promissory note stipulate that the
         outstanding principal balance may be paid at maturity at
         AST's option in cash or the common stock of AST.
         However, at Tandy's option not more than 50% of the
         initial principal balance may be paid in common stock of
         AST.  The promissory note is supported by a standby
         letter of credit in the amount of the lesser of
         $100,000,000 or 70% of the outstanding principal amount
         of the promissory note.  At December 31, 1993, the
         standby letter of credit approximated $67,704,000.
         Accounts receivable relating to the computer operations,
         approximating $83,000,000 at June 30, 1993, inured to
         the benefit of Tandy upon collection.  At December 31,
         1993, the balance of the remaining accounts receivable,
         net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $7,700,000.
         Tandy also retained certain inventory which it intends
         to liquidate before June 30, 1994.  At December 31,
         1993, this inventory amounted to approximately
         $3,700,000.

              In October 1993, the Company sold its computer
         marketing operations in France to AST, together with
         certain other multimedia assets and additional Swedish
         inventory, for an aggregate of approximately $6,700,000,
         which was evidenced by an increase in the amount of the
         promissory note described above to $96,700,000.  The
         Company has discounted this note by $2,000,000 and the
         discount will be recognized as interest using the
         effective interest rate method over the life of the
         note.

              Memtek Products.  On November 10, 1993, the Company
         executed a definitive agreement with Hanny Magnetics
         (B.V.I.) Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation
         ("Hanny") to purchase certain assets of the Company's
         Memtek Products operations, including the license
         agreement with Memorex Telex, N.V. for the use of the
         Memorex trademark on licensed consumer electronics
         products.  This sale closed on December 16, 1993.  As of
         December 31, 1993, Tandy has received payments of
         $62,500,000, recorded a $7,102,000 receivable from Hanny
         for the remaining purchase price and retained
         approximately $61,000,000 in accounts receivable and
         certain other assets for liquidation.  Hanny is a
         subsidiary of Hanny Magnetics (Holdings) Limited, a
         Bermuda corporation, listed on the Hong Kong Stock
         Exchange.  At December 31, 1993, accounts receivable,
         net of related allowance for doubtful accounts, retained
         by Tandy approximated $40,100,000.

              O'Sullivan Industries.  On November 23, 1993, the
         Company announced that it would sell the common stock of
         O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ("O'Sullivan") in an initial
         public offering.  On January 27, 1994 the Company
         announced that it had reached an agreement with the
         underwriters to sell O'Sullivan Industries Holdings,
         Inc., the parent company of O'Sullivan, common stock to
         the public at $22 per share.  The net proceeds realized
         by Tandy in the initial public offering, together with
         the $40,000,000 cash dividend from O'Sullivan
         Industries, Inc., approximated $350,000,000.  The
         initial public offering closed on February 2, 1994.

              Pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit
         Reimbursement Agreement between Tandy and O'Sullivan
         Industries Holdings, Inc. the Company will receive
         payments from O'Sullivan resulting from an increased tax
         basis of O'Sullivan's assets thereby increasing tax
         deductions and accordingly, reducing income taxes
         payable by O'Sullivan.  The amount to be received by the
         Company each year will approximate the federal tax
         benefit expected to be realized with respect to the
         increased tax basis.  These payments will be made over a
         15-year time period.  The Company will recognize these
         payments as additional sale proceeds and gain in the
         year in which the payments become due and payable to the
         Company.

              Lika.  On January 24, 1994, the Company announced
         that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its
         manufacturing facilities which make Lika printed circuit
         boards.  This divestiture is expected to close by June
         1994 and is expected to yield approximately $17,000,000
         in proceeds, including cash, a note and the liquidation
         of certain retained assets.

         In connection with the computer manufacturing sale and
    the Memtek Products sale, the Company agreed to retain
    certain liabilities primarily relating to warranty
    obligations on products sold prior to the sale.  Management
    believes that accrued reserves, as reflected on its December
    31, 1993 balance sheet, are adequate to cover estimated
    future warranty obligations for the products and for any
    remaining costs to dispose of these operations.

         With the closing of the Lika transaction, the
    divestiture program announced in June 1993 will be complete.
    The proceeds from the divestitures are being used to reduce
    short-term debt and for the expansion of the Incredible
    Universe and Computer City store operations.  See
    "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
    Operations and Financial Condition" and Note 3 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

    SALE OF JOINT VENTURE INTEREST
         During the quarter ended September 30, 1993, the Company
    entered into definitive agreements with Nokia Corporation
    ("Nokia") to sell the Company's interests in two cellular
    telephone manufacturing joint ventures with Nokia, TMC
    Company Ltd. located in Masan, Korea, and TNC Company located
    in Fort Worth, Texas.  Pursuant to the terms of the
    definitive agreements, the Company received an aggregate of
    approximately $31,700,000 for its interests in these joint
    ventures.  The Company also entered into a three-year
    Preferred Supplier Agreement pursuant to which it has agreed
    to purchase from Nokia substantially all of Radio Shack's
    requirements for cellular telephones at prevailing
    competitive market prices at the time of the purchase.  These
    operations were not part of the overall divestment plan
    adopted in June 1993 by the Company's Board of Directors;
    therefore, the gain from the sale and their results of
    operations are not included in discontinued operations.

    SEASONALITY
         As is the case with other retail businesses, the
    Company's net sales and other revenues are greater during the
    Christmas season than during other periods of the year. 
    There is a corresponding pre-seasonal inventory build-up
    requiring working capital associated with this increased
    sales volume.  For additional information, see Note 22 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

    PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
         Tandy owns or is licensed to use many trademarks related
    to its business in the United States and in foreign
    countries.  Radio Shack, Computer City, Incredible Universe,
    McDuff Electronics, VideoConcepts, Realistic, Tandy and
    Optimus are some of the registered marks most widely used by
    the Company.  Tandy believes that the Radio Shack, Computer
    City and Incredible Universe names and marks are
    well-recognized and associated with a high-quality service
    provider by consumers.  The Company's products are sold
    primarily under the Radio Shack, Optimus, Tandy and Realistic
    trademarks which are registered in the U.S. and many foreign
    countries.  The Company believes that the loss of the Radio
    Shack name or mark would be material to its business, but
    does not believe that the loss of any one trademark
    registration would be material.

         Tandy also owns, and is in the process of applying for,
    various patents relating to retail and support functions.

    SUPPLIERS
         The Company obtains merchandise from a large number of
    suppliers from various parts of the world.  Alternative
    sources of supply exist for most merchandise purchased by the
    Company.  As the Company's product line is diverse, the
    Company would not expect a lack of availability of any single
    product to have a material impact on its operations.

    BACKLOG ORDERS
         The Company has no material backlog of orders for the
    products it sells.

    COMPETITION
         The consumer electronics retail business is highly
    competitive.  The Company competes in the sale of its
    products with department stores, mail order houses, discount
    stores, general merchants, home appliance stores and gift
    stores which sell comparable products manufactured by others.
    Competitors range in size from local drug and hardware stores
    to large chains and department stores.  Computer store chains
    and franchise groups as well as independent computer stores
    and several major retailers compete with the Company in the
    retail personal computer marketplace.  Consumer electronic
    and computer mail-order companies also compete with the
    Company.  The products which compete with those sold by the
    Company are manufactured by numerous domestic and foreign
    manufacturers.  Many of these products carry nationally
    recognized brand names or private labels and are sold in
    markets common to the Company.  Some of the Company's
    competitors have financial resources equal to or greater than
    the Company's resources.

         Management believes that among the factors that are
    important to its competitive position are price, quality,
    service and the broad selection of electronic products and
    computers carried at conveniently located retail outlets. The
    Company's utilization of trained personnel and its ability to
    use national and local advertising media are important to the
    Company's ability to compete in the consumer electronics
    marketplace.  Management of the Company believes it is a
    strong competitor in each of the factors referenced above. 
    Given the highly competitive nature of the consumer
    electronics retail business, no assurance can be given that
    the Company will continue to compete successfully in all of
    the factors referenced above.  However, the Company would be
    adversely affected if its competitors were to offer their
    products at significantly lower prices, introduce innovative
    or technologically superior products not yet available to the
    Company or if the Company were unable to obtain products in a
    timely manner for an extended period of time.

         The Company focuses on various types of store formats to
    address the marketplace.  Each of the Company's retailing
    formats uses a distinct but complementary path to the
    marketplace, based on its unique customer appeal, marketing
    strengths and margin structure.

              Radio Shack.  Radio Shack stores offer the
         shopping convenience of approximately 6,555 outlets,
         high-quality private label products, unique selection,
         knowledgeable personnel and excellent customer service.
         Radio Shack has strong sales in approximately 3,200
         different items in such consumer-demand product
         categories as speakers, batteries, communications
         equipment, tape decks, antennas, electronic components
         and accessories.

              Computer City.  Computer City stores offer
         approximately 5,000 different name-brand items,
         competitive prices and excellent customer service on
         computers, computer software and accessories.

              Tandy Name Brand Retail Group.  This group sells
         name brand consumer electronics and appliances in three
         distinctly different types of store formats.
         VideoConcepts and McDuff Electronics mall stores average
         approximately 3,100 square feet in size.  McDuff
         SuperCenters average approximately 12,200 square
         feet and are located in many secondary markets.  The
         Edge in Electronics stores average approximately 1,100
         square feet in size, carry approximately 1,000 different
         name brand personal and portable consumer electronics
         products and are located in major markets.

              Incredible Universe.  A new concept in the
         retailing of name brand consumer electronics are 160,000
         to 200,000 square foot stores which provide the customer
         with a "universe" of choices.  These stores carry over
         85,000 different stock-keeping units.

         The Company has faced intense competition in its
    consumer electronics retailing businesses.  Competition is
    driven by technology and product cycles, as well as the
    economy.  In the consumer electronics retailing business,
    competitive factors include price, product quality,
    manufacturing and distribution capability and brand
    reputation.  The Company believes that its retailing formats
    compete effectively in their respective marketplaces.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
         Research and development expenditures are not
    significant.

    EMPLOYEES
         As of December 31, 1993, the Company had approximately
    42,000 employees, excluding 2,000 full time employees
    associated with discontinued operations at O'Sullivan and
    Lika.  The number also excludes temporary retail employees
    remaining from the Christmas selling season.  Management of
    the Company considers the relationship between the Company
    and its employees to be good.  It does not anticipate any
    work stoppage due to labor difficulties.


    ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

         Information on the Company's properties is in
    "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
    Operations and Financial Condition" and the financial
    statements included in this Form 10-K and is incorporated
    herein by reference. The following items are discussed
    further on the following pages:

                                                Page
        Retail Outlets . . . . . . . . .         16
        Property, Plant and Equipment. .         43
        Leases . . . . . . . . . . . . .         47

         The Company leases rather than owns most of its retail
    facilities. However, the land and buildings of most of the
    Incredible Universe stores are owned rather than leased.  The
    Radio Shack, Tandy Name Brand Retail Group and Computer City
    stores are located primarily in major shopping malls,
    stand-alone buildings or shopping centers owned by other
    companies.  The Company owns most of the property on which
    its executive offices are located in Fort Worth, Texas as
    well as five distribution facilities and most of its
    manufacturing facilities and land located throughout the
    United States.  Existing warehouse and office facilities are
    deemed adequate to meet the Company's needs in the
    foreseeable future.


    ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

         In July 1985, Pan American Electronics, Inc., a Radio
    Shack dealer in Mission, Texas ("Pan Am"), filed suit against
    the Company in the 92nd Judicial District Court in Hidalgo
    County, Texas.  The Plaintiff's complaint alleged breach of
    contract and fraud based upon the allegations that the
    Company made certain misrepresentations and acted beyond the
    scope of its authority under the dealer agreement, with the
    alleged result that the plaintiff was forced out of the
    computer mail order business in 1984.  In November 1993, Pan
    Am and Tandy resolved the pending litigation and the lawsuit
    was dismissed in December 1993.  Although the terms of the
    settlement are confidential, the resolution of this legal
    action did not have a materially adverse impact on the
    Company's financial position or results of operation.

         There are various other claims, lawsuits, disputes with
    third parties, investigations and pending actions involving
    allegations of negligence, product defects, discrimination,
    patent infringement, tax deficiencies and breach of contract
    against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the
    operation of its business.  The liability, if any, associated
    with these matters was not determinable at December 31, 1993.
    While certain of these matters involve substantial amounts,
    and although occasional adverse settlements or resolutions
    may occur and negatively impact earnings in the year of
    settlement, it is the opinion of management that their
    ultimate resolution will not have a materially adverse effect
    on Tandy's financial position.

    ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

         At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held October 15,
    1993, the Company elected directors to serve for the ensuing
    year and voted to adopt the Tandy Corporation 1993 Incentive
    Stock Plan.  Out of the 80,915,627 eligible votes, 63,361,775
    votes were cast at the meeting either by proxies solicited in
    accordance with Schedule 14A or by security holders voting in
    person.  There were 9,890,351 broker non-votes which are not
    included in the following table as they were not treated as
    being present at the meeting.  In the case of directors,
    abstentions are treated as votes withheld and are included in
    the table.  No other matters were voted on at the meeting. 
    The tabulation of votes for each nominee is set forth below
    under Item No. 1 and the vote on the Tandy Corporation 1993
    Incentive Stock Plan is set forth under Item No. 2 below:

    ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

         Tandy Corporation ("Tandy" or the "Company") changed its
    fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31 effective
    December 31, 1992.

         The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of
    Results of Operations and Financial Condition compares the
    full calendar year ended December 31, 1993 with the full
    fiscal years ended June 30, 1992 and 1991.  Although these
    twelve-month periods end at different times, management
    believes that the seasonality of the retail business relating
    to Christmas is so significant that it would distort trends
    and related percentage comparisons to sales for the readers
    if a full year's results were compared to the six-month
    transition period ended December 31, 1992.

    NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES
         For the year ending December 31, 1993, overall sales
    grew 12% to $4,102,551,000 as compared to $3,649,284,000 for
    the fiscal year ending June 30, 1992.  This increase was
    primarily due to the opening of three Incredible Universe
    stores and the expansion of the Computer City chain.  On a
    comparable store basis, Radio Shack's sales increased
    slightly during the year ended December 31, 1993 as compared
    to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  A moderate increase
    in sales of Radio Shack's core business (i.e., consumer
    electronics and accessories) was offset by a decline in sales
    of personal computers through the Radio Shack division.

         The decrease in Radio Shack's computer business reflects
    the impact of sharply lower pricing in response to
    competitive pressures in the marketplace.  The changing
    dynamics of the personal computer business has had a
    significant impact on Radio Shack's performance during fiscal
    years 1993, 1992 and 1991.  A combination of shifts in retail
    distribution to super stores and telemarketing combined with
    rapidly declining prices has taken the computer category from
    approximately 17.0% of Radio Shack's sales with a gross
    profit of 29.0% in the year ended June 30, 1992 to
    approximately 14.2% of sales and a gross profit of 15.2% for
    the year ended December 31, 1993.  Radio Shack's extensive
    assortment of electronic parts, accessories and specialty
    items differentiates it from other consumer electronics
    retailers in the marketplace.   The table below shows the
    breakdown by major category of Radio Shack sales.

    </TABLE>

         The decline in Radio Shack's computer sales has been
    offset by sales of the Computer City chain.  The Computer
    City chain opened its 40th supercenter in December 1993,
    approximately two years after its initial launching of eight
    stores.  Computer City's sales increases were the result of
    25 additional stores since June 30, 1992 and comparable store
    sales gains at old stores in excess of 30% for the year ended
    December 31, 1993.

         The Name Brand Retail Group experienced a sales decrease
    in calendar 1993 as compared to the June 1992 fiscal year.
    This decrease was primarily a result of the closing of 110
    McDuff and VideoConcepts stores in February 1993.  This
    decline was offset in part by the addition of three
    Incredible Universe stores.  The first two Incredible
    Universe stores were opened in the fall of 1992 with the
    third having been added in the fall of 1993.

         Shipments to InterTAN Inc. decreased for calendar year
    1993 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.  See
    the discussion in the "InterTAN  Update" found on page 23.

         For the six-month period ending December 31, 1992, net
    sales and operating revenues increased 6.4% to
    $2,161,149,000.  This increase was primarily due to the
    opening of two Incredible Universe stores and expansion of
    the Computer City chain.  Comparable store sales were
    essentially even with the six-month period ended December 31,
    1991.

         The change in the Company's sales in the fiscal years
    ended June 30, 1992 and 1991 reflected a continued adverse
    product cycle in consumer electronics, a weak economy and
    widespread price cutting in the personal computer market.
    Sales through all retail stores increased 3.2% in the fiscal
    year ended June 30, 1992 as compared with fiscal 1991.

         The increase in sales in the fiscal year ended June 30,
    1992 was primarily due to new store expansions.  During
    fiscal 1992, 15 Computer City stores, 34 McDuff and
    VideoConcepts stores and seven of The Edge in Electronics
    stores were opened.  On a company-wide basis, comparable
    store sales declined 1% in fiscal 1992 following a similar
    decline in the prior year.  Comparable store sales increased
    slightly at Radio Shack in fiscal 1992 due to the continued
    strengthening of its electronics parts, accessories and
    specialty items business.  This increase more than offset a
    decline in Radio Shack's computer business which was impacted
    significantly by extensive price cutting in the marketplace.
    Comparable store sales of the McDuff and VideoConcepts stores
    were down 10% in fiscal 1992 as compared to fiscal 1991,
    reflecting intense competitive pressures in name brand
    electronics retailing.

         To address the pricing and distribution shifts in
    computer retailing, the Computer City chain of super stores
    was launched in October 1991 (fiscal year ended June 30,
    1992).  The Computer City format is designed to sell high
    volumes of well known name brand personal computers and
    related products at discount prices.

         Though in operation for only the last seven months of
    fiscal 1992, Computer City's sales more than offset the
    decline in the Company's U.S. computer sales through Radio
    Shack and direct sales.  As of June 30, 1992, 15 Computer
    City stores were in operation, 13 in the U.S. and two in
    Europe.


    GROSS PROFIT
         Gross profit as a percent of sales and operating
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 1993 was 41.9% as
    compared to 43.5% for the six months ended December 31, 1992,
    47.2% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 and 48.7% for
    the fiscal year ended June 30, 1991.  The decline, in part,
    reflects the faster growth of new high-volume formats such as
    Computer City and Incredible Universe with inherently lower
    gross margins than Radio Shack stores.  The Company expects
    this trend to continue as sales at Incredible Universe and
    Computer City increase.  Combined Computer City and
    Incredible Universe sales contributed 18.6%, 8.9% and 2.6% to
    consolidated sales in the fiscal year ended December 31,
    1993, the six months ended December 31, 1992 and the fiscal
    year ended June 30, 1992, respectively.  The 5.3% decline in
    gross profit percent from fiscal 1992 reflects the growth of
    the newer retail businesses.  Management expects the
    long-term impact of accelerated growth for its new businesses
    to result in a lower consolidated gross margin as a percent
    of sales and operating revenues.

         In addition to the increasing effect of the lower gross
    margin businesses, Radio Shack's gross margin has trended
    down during the fiscal years ended December 31, 1993 and June
    30, 1992 and 1991 because of a decline in computer margins
    resulting from more competitive pricing.  In the absence of
    any additional major decreases in computer retail prices in
    the industry, management believes this decline in Radio
    Shack's gross margin will diminish during 1994.  Partially
    offsetting the decline were increased sales of high-margin
    electronic parts, accessories and specialty items sold
    through Radio Shack.  In management's opinion, new concepts
    which could increase Radio Shack gross margins include
    introducing the Radio Shack Gift Express program, creating
    new store formats and the launching of The Repair Shop at
    Radio Shack, a name brand out-of-warranty repair program.
    Competitive pressures in name brand electronics retailing
    decreased McDuff's and VideoConcepts' gross margins in each
    of the three fiscal years ended December 31, 1993 and June
    30, 1992 and 1991.  Additionally, gross margins were impacted
    in the McDuff and VideoConcepts units by the increasing
    percentage of sales related to the lower margin computer
    category.

    SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
         Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") as
    a percent of sales and operating revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 1993 declined from the year ended June 30, 1992
    and declined for the six months ended December 31, 1992 from
    the six months ended December 31, 1991.  The accompanying
    table summarizes the breakdown of various components of SG&A
    and their related percentage of sales and operating revenues.
    The lower SG&A percent reflects the lower costs, relative to
    net sales and operating revenues associated with the
    Company's newer retail formats, as well as the lower
    operating costs achieved through cost reduction programs and
    the further streamlining of operations in the new retail
    formats.

         SG&A expenses as a percent of sales and operating
    revenues declined in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 as
    compared with fiscal 1991.  The benefits of actions taken to
    streamline operations and reduce costs are reflected in most
    expense categories in fiscal 1992.

         Year-to-year comparisons are impacted by the $18,987,000
    gain which includes a foreign currency gain of $6,894,000 in
    fiscal year 1992 from the sale of a Japanese subsidiary, the
    assets of which were primarily real estate, and the remaining
    foreign currency gain of $3,748,000 recognized in 1992 as
    opposed to a foreign currency gain of only $762,000 in 1993.
    The Company's exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has
    decreased significantly with the disposal of the Company's
    computer manufacturing and marketing operations as well as
    the disposal of Memtek Products.  Both of these operations
    had significant European operations.

         Advertising costs have decreased in dollars and as a
    percent of sales and operating revenues in the fiscal year
    ended December 31, 1993 as compared to the fiscal years ended
    June 30, 1992 and 1991.  Management has focused its efforts
    on more efficient advertising methods in Radio Shack
    utilizing the Company's data base of customer activity to
    reduce costs while maintaining market awareness.

         Rent expense has declined slightly in dollars and more
    significantly as a percent of sales during the year ended
    December 31, 1993 as compared to fiscal 1992.  This
    percentage decrease results primarily from the fact that the
    Company owns most of the Incredible Universe locations and is
    additionally impacted by Computer City's low rent to sales
    ratio.

         The Company's credit operations have been successful in
    supporting sales of the retail operations.  Private label
    credit cards represented 34% of credit sales for the year
    ended December 31, 1993, 36% for the six months ended
    December 31, 1992, 43% in fiscal 1992 and 44% in fiscal 1991. 
    This decline in the percentage results from increased sales
    through the Computer City and Incredible Universe stores
    which have a lower percentage of private label card usage. A
    decrease in bad debt expense relates to tighter credit
    controls and a 4% decline from fiscal 1992 in overall private
    label credit card sales. Expenses associated with the credit
    card operations which are included in SG&A expense have
    decreased.

    PROVISION FOR BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING
         The Company adopted a plan resulting in business
    restructuring charges during the six months ended December
    31, 1992 designed to improve the Company's competitiveness
    and future profitability.  The pre-tax charge of $48,000,000
    related primarily to the closing of approximately 110 of the
    432 Tandy Name Brand Retail Group stores, mainly McDuff
    Supercenters in major market areas and, to a lesser extent,
    the elimination of certain product lines.  Some product lines
    were reduced or eliminated after consideration of competitive
    factors and market trends.

         In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1991, the Company
    recorded a business restructuring charge of $8,531,000.  The
    charge covered anticipated costs associated with Radio Shack
    computer centers which were being closed, relocated or
    converted to other store formats or sales offices.  These
    costs included the estimated lease obligations for store
    closings and relocations as well as estimated fixed asset
    write-offs for all affected stores.

    DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
         Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of
    sales and operating revenues decreased slightly in the year
    ended December 31, 1993 as compared with the year ended June
    30, 1992.  The dollar amount of depreciation and amortization
    expense for the year ended December 31, 1993 increased 7%
    over the dollar amount for the year ended June 30, 1992, due
    to additional capital expenditures related to the three
    Incredible Universe stores and the addition of 25 new
    Computer City stores.  The dollar amount of depreciation and
    amortization expense for the year ended June 30, 1992
    increased 5% over the prior fiscal year due to increased
    capital expenditures related to the new Tandy Name Brand
    Retail Group and Computer City super stores and the
    remodeling of Radio Shack stores.

    1993 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992
    resulted from a decrease in the average credit card
    receivables outstanding during the period.  This decline
    results from increased payments from credit customers
    reflecting the overall improvement in the economy and a
    desire by consumers to shift debt to lower interest rate
    instruments.  The increase in interest income of the credit
    company in the six months ended December 31, 1992 as compared
    to December 31, 1991 resulted from growth of consumer credit
    card receivables.  The decrease in interest income of the
    credit company in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 as
    compared with fiscal year 1991 resulted from the
    securitization of private label receivables in June 1991.

         Interest income, exclusive of Tandy Credit Corporation's
    income, represented primarily interest on short-term
    investments.  The increase in interest income for the year
    ended December 31, 1993 compared to the fiscal year ended
    June 30, 1992 was due to the increase in short-term
    investments as proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued
    operations were received and to the recognition of interest
    income on the AST and InterTAN notes receivable.  Interest
    income as it relates to InterTAN notes receivable will
    increase in fiscal 1994 as the Company will commence
    recording the accretion of discount relating thereto.  See
    further discussion on notes receivable in the "InterTAN
    Update".

         The decrease in interest expense for the year ended
    December 31, 1993 as compared to the year ended June 30, 1992
    is due to the decrease of total debt and lower U.S. interest
    rates.  Overall interest expense should decline in fiscal
    1994 as the Company receives cash proceeds from the disposal
    of its discontinued operations and applies a significant
    portion of such proceeds against short-term debt and toward
    the retirement of its 10% subordinated debentures.  Partially
    offsetting the decline in expected interest expense in 1994
    will be higher interest rates resulting from the Federal
    Reserve Bank's move to keep inflation low in the overall U.S.
    economy.  The decrease in interest expense in the fiscal year
    ended June 30, 1992 reflected the reduced debt attributable
    to the securitization of private label credit card
    receivables and lower interest rates.

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
         The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31,
    1993 was 37.1%.  The higher effective tax rate for the year
    ended December 31, 1993 as compared to 36.2% for the year
    ended June 30, 1992 and 36.0% for the year ended June 30,
    1991 reflects the impact of the increase of the federal tax
    rate to 35% from 34%.  The effective tax rate for the
    six-month period ended December 31, 1992 was 34.2%.  This
    lower effective rate reflects the successful resolution of
    certain IRS examinations during the period.

         The requirements of Financial Accounting Standard No.
    109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", which the Company adopted
    January 1, 1993, are discussed in Note 12 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
         On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy
    adopted a formal plan of divestiture under which it would
    sell its computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the
    O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ready-to-assemble furniture
    manufacturing and related marketing business, the Memtek
    Products division and the Lika printed circuit board
    business.  The divestiture plan replaced the Company's plan
    to spin off all of the Company's manufacturing and marketing
    businesses as described in Tandy's Transition Report on Form
    10-K/A-4 for the six-month period ended December 31, 1992. 
    In connection with the plan of divestiture the Company
    accounted for the divestiture of these businesses as
    discontinued operations and recognized an after-tax charge of
    $70,000,000 in its quarter ended June 30, 1993.  This charge
    was subsequently reduced by approximately $15,822,000 in the
    quarter ended December 31, 1993.  The reduction of the
    reserve previously taken resulted from the better than
    anticipated sales price received for O'Sullivan Industries
    Holdings, Inc. partially offset by additional foreign
    currency translation losses and below plan operating results
    of the divested companies during the divestment period, net
    of related income tax adjustments.  Prior year results of
    operations have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued
    operations treatment.

         Computer Manufacturing.  In furtherance of the
    divestiture plan, the Company closed the sale of the computer
    manufacturing and marketing businesses to AST Research, Inc.
    ("AST") on July 13, 1993.  In accordance with the terms of
    the definitive agreement between Tandy and AST, Tandy
    received $15,000,000 upon closing of the sale.  The balance
    of the purchase price of $90,000,000 (as adjusted
    post-closing based on the results of an audit of the assets
    and liabilities conveyed) is payable by a promissory note.
    The promissory note is payable in three years and interest is
    accrued and paid annually.  The interest rate on the
    promissory note is currently 3.75% per annum and is adjusted
    annually, not to exceed 5% per annum.  The terms of the
    promissory note stipulate that the outstanding principal
    balance may be paid at maturity at AST's option in cash or
    the common stock of AST.  However, at Tandy's option not more
    than 50% of the initial principal balance may be paid in
    common stock of AST.  The promissory note is supported by a
    standby letter of credit in the amount of the lesser of
    $100,000,000 or 70% of the outstanding principal amount of
    the promissory note.  At December 31, 1993, the standby
    letter of credit approximated $67,704,000.  Accounts
    receivable relating to the computer operations, approximating
    $83,000,000 at June 30, 1993, inured to the benefit of Tandy
    upon collection.  At December 31, 1993, the balance of the
    remaining accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful
    accounts, was $7,700,000.  Tandy also retained certain
    inventory which it intends to liquidate before June 30, 1994.
    At December 31, 1993, this inventory amounted to
    approximately $3,700,000.

         In October 1993, the Company sold its computer marketing
    operations in France to AST, together with certain other
    multimedia assets and additional Swedish inventory, for an
    aggregate of approximately $6,700,000, which was evidenced by
    an increase in the amount of the promissory note described
    above to $96,700,000.  The Company has discounted this note
    by $2,000,000 and the discount will be recognized as income
    using the effective interest rate method over the life of the
    note.

         Memtek Products.  On November 10, 1993, the Company
    executed a definitive agreement with Hanny Magnetics (B.V.I.)
    Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation ("Hanny") to
    purchase certain assets of the Company's Memtek Products
    operations, including the license agreement with Memorex
    Telex, N.V. for the use of the Memorex trademark on licensed
    consumer electronics products.  This sale closed on December
    16, 1993.  As of December 31, 1993, Tandy has received
    payments of $62,500,000, recorded a $7,102,000 receivable
    from Hanny for the remaining purchase price and retained
    approximately $61,000,000 in accounts receivable and certain
    other assets for liquidation.  Hanny is a subsidiary of Hanny
    Magnetics (Holdings) Limited, a Bermuda corporation, listed
    on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  At December 31, 1993,
    accounts receivable, net of related allowance for doubtful
    accounts, retained by Tandy approximated $40,100,000.

         O'Sullivan Industries.  On November 23, 1993, the
    Company announced that it would sell the common stock of
    O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ("O'Sullivan") in an initial
    public offering.  On January 27, 1994 the Company announced
    that it had reached an agreement with the underwriters to
    sell O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc., the parent company
    of O'Sullivan, common stock to the public at $22 per share.
    The net proceeds realized by Tandy in the initial public
    offering, together with the $40,000,000 cash dividend from
    O'Sullivan, approximated $350,000,000.  The initial public
    offering closed on February 2, 1994.

         Pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement
    Agreement between Tandy and O'Sullivan Industries Holdings,
    Inc., the Company will receive payments from O'Sullivan
    resulting from an increased tax basis of O'Sullivan's assets
    thereby increasing tax deductions and accordingly, reducing
    income taxes payable by O'Sullivan.  The amount to be
    received by the Company each year will approximate the
    federal tax benefit expected to be realized with respect to
    the increased tax basis.  These payments will be made over a
    15-year time period.  The Company will recognize these
    payments as additional sale proceeds and gain in the year in
    which the payments become due and payable to the Company.

         Lika.  On January 24, 1994, the Company announced that
    it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its
    manufacturing facilities which make Lika printed circuit
    boards.  This divestiture is expected to close by June 1994
    and is expected to yield approximately $17,000,000 in
    proceeds, including cash, a note and the liquidation of
    certain retained assets.

         In connection with the computer manufacturing sale and
    the Memtek Products sale, the Company agreed to retain
    certain liabilities primarily relating to warranty
    obligations on products sold prior to the sale.  Management
    believes that accrued reserves, as reflected on its December
    31, 1993 balance sheet, are adequate to cover estimated
    future warranty obligations for the products and for any
    remaining costs to dispose of these operations.

         With the closing of the Lika transaction, the
    divestiture program announced in June 1993 will be complete. 
    Proceeds from the formal divestiture plan should total
    approximately $715,000,000 including net income tax benefits
    of $16,600,000 and notes receivable of approximately
    $100,000,000 that mature by the end of 1996.  The proceeds
    from the divestitures are being used to reduce short-term
    debt and for the expansion of the Incredible Universe and
    Computer City store operations.

    </TABLE>


         Tandy's cash flow and liquidity, in management's
    opinion,  remains strong.  During the year ended December 31,
    1993, cash provided by operations was $322,294,000 as
    compared to $146,782,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30,
    1992.  The increased cash flow from operations in calendar
    1993 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 was due
    partially to receivables which provided $30,133,000 in cash
    in 1993 but used $121,719,000 in 1992.  The decline in
    accounts receivable in 1993 versus 1992 is due to the
    liquidation of receivables related to the divested operations
    and lower consumer receivables related to the Company's
    private label credit card portfolio.  The latter reason
    reflects consumers' desires to liquidate debt with higher
    interest rates and the overall improved economy.  Inventory
    required less cash in calendar 1993 than in fiscal 1992.  The
    increase in inventory during 1993 related to new store
    openings and the expansion of Radio Shack's core product lines.

         Investing activities involved capital expenditures, net
    of retirements, primarily for retail expansion of
    $129,287,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to
    $127,495,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992.
    Proceeds received from the sale of divested operations
    totaled $111,988,000 during the year ended December 31, 1993.
    Investing activities in 1993 also included $31,663,000 for
    the purchase of InterTAN's bank debt and the
    extension/funding of a working capital line of credit.  See
    "InterTAN Update" for further information.  Short-term debt
    of $46,885,000 and long-term debt of $62,195,000 were retired
    during 1993.  Future store expansions and refurbishments and
    other capital expenditures are expected to approximate
    $150,000,000 to $180,000,000 per year over the next two years
    and will be funded primarily from available cash, proceeds
    from divestiture of discontinued operations, cash flow from
    operations and proceeds from possible sale/leaseback
    arrangements of Incredible Universe stores.

         Operating cash flow in the fiscal year ended June 30,
    1992 was $146,782,000 compared to $617,353,000 for the fiscal
    year ended June 30, 1991.  This decreased cash flow was
    partially due to the $89,441,000 increase in inventories for
    the Tandy Name Brand Retail Group and Computer City store
    expansions in fiscal 1992 compared to a $151,339,000 decrease
    in inventories in 1991.  Operating cash flow was also higher
    in 1991 due to the cash proceeds from the securitization of
    $350,000,000 of credit card receivables.

         The Company's investing activities were generally for
    capital expenditures in fiscal 1992 which totaled
    $127,495,000.  The capital expenditures were used principally
    for Radio Shack's store remodeling program, expansion of the
    Computer City store chain and initial construction of two
    Incredible Universe stores.

         Financing activities in the fiscal year ended June 30,
    1992 included the sale of Depositary Shares of PERCS for
    $430,000,000 and the subsequent purchase of common stock with
    the proceeds of this preferred stock issue.  Long-term and
    short-term debt of $20,098,000 was retired in the year ended
    June 30, 1992 compared to fiscal 1991 retirements of $441,577,000.

         The above ratings are investment grade ratings. 
    Management does not believe that a downgrade in 1993 by
    Moody's has had or will have a materially adverse effect on
    the Company's ability to borrow funds although the borrowings
    may be slightly more costly.

    CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
         The Company's balance sheet and financial condition
    continue to be strong.  The Company's available borrowing
    facilities as of December 31, 1993 are detailed in Note 9 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are
    incorporated herein by reference.

         Proceeds from the sale of divested operations totaled
    $111,988,000 through December 31, 1993.  The net assets
    associated with discontinued operations remaining to be
    divested were $405,664,000 at December 31, 1993 and related
    primarily to O'Sullivan which was disposed of in February
    1994 and Lika whose sale is pending.  Other information
    related to discontinued operations are discussed in
    "Discontinued Operations".

         In the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, the Company
    issued 150,000 PERCS shares and used the proceeds of this
    offering to purchase $430,000,000 of the Company's common
    stock for treasury.  Each PERCS share has an annual dividend
    rate of $214.00 and is automatically convertible on April 15,
    1995 into 100 shares of common stock, par value $1 per share,
    subject to possible adjustment based upon the market value of
    the common stock on the conversion date or the occurrence of
    certain other events.  Based upon the market price of the
    Company's common stock at December 31, 1993, each PERCS share
    would have converted into 83 shares.  At any time prior to
    April 15, 1995, the Company may call the PERCS.  The PERCS
    are discussed further in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

         The Company's issue of 10% subordinated debentures due
    June 30, 1994 was called by the Company on February 23, 1994
    for redemption on April 1, 1994.  The redemption will be at
    the price of 100% of face value or approximately $32,000,000.

         In fiscal 1991, the Company filed a shelf registration
    for $500,000,000, of which $400,000,000 was designated for
    medium-term notes, and Tandy Credit Corporation increased its
    medium-term note program by $200,000,000.  During fiscal
    1991, short-term debt was refinanced by the issuance of
    $155,500,000 in medium-term notes.  In the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 1991, Tandy Credit Corporation completed an asset
    securitization to increase financial flexibility.  Credit
    card receivables were sold to the Tandy Master Trust which
    issued $350,000,000 of participating 8.25% Class A Asset
    Backed Certificates, Series A.  Proceeds were primarily used
    to retire short-term debt.

         Tandy established an employee stock ownership plan
    ("TESOP") in 1990.  This plan issued $100,000,000 of debt in
    July 1990 to purchase preferred stock from the Company for
    funding of the plan.  The Company has guaranteed the
    repayment of the TESOP notes and, as a result, the
    indebtedness of the TESOP has been recognized as a long-term
    obligation on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.
    Dividend payments and contributions by the Company will be
    used to repay the indebtedness.

         The debt-to-capitalization ratio was 22.8%, 27.3%, 23.4%
    and 24.8% at December 31, 1993, December 31, 1992, June 30,
    1992 and June 30, 1991, respectively.  This
    debt-to-capitalization ratio should improve further in fiscal
    1994 due to the cash proceeds from divestitures being used to
    retire debt.

         The Company's available borrowing facilities as of
    December 31, 1993 are detailed in Note 9 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.  Management believes that
    the Company's present borrowing capacity is greater than the
    established credit lines and long-term debt in place.
    Management believes that the Company's cash flow from
    operations, cash and short-term investments, expected
    proceeds from divestitures and its available borrowing
    facilities are more than adequate to fund planned store
    expansion, growth in the Company's private label credit
    accounts, retirement of the 10% subordinated debentures and
    to meet debt service and preferred dividend requirements.

         Inflation has not significantly impacted the Company
    over the past three years.  Management does not expect
    inflation to have a significant impact on operations in the
    foreseeable future unless global situations substantially
    affect the world economy.

         The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    issued Statement of Position 93-7, "Reporting on Advertising
    Costs" in December 1993.  The statement generally requires
    all advertising costs to be expensed in the period in which
    the costs are incurred or the first time the advertising
    takes place and is effective for years beginning after June
    15, 1994.  The statement is not anticipated to have any
    material effect on the results of operation or financial
    condition of the Company.

    SALE OF JOINT VENTURE INTEREST
         During the quarter ended September 30, 1993, the Company
    entered into definitive agreements with Nokia Corporation
    ("Nokia") to sell the Company's interests in two cellular
    telephone manufacturing joint ventures with Nokia, TMC
    Company Ltd. located in Masan, Korea, and TNC Company located
    in Fort Worth, Texas.  Pursuant to the terms of the
    definitive agreements, the Company received an aggregate of
    approximately $31,700,000 for its interests in these joint
    ventures.  The Company also entered into a three-year
    Preferred Supplier Agreement pursuant to which it has agreed
    to purchase from Nokia substantially all of Radio Shack's
    requirements for cellular telephones at prevailing
    competitive market prices at the time of the purchase.  These
    operations were not part of the overall divestment plan
    adopted in June 1993 by the Company's Board of Directors;
    therefore, the gain on the sale and their results of
    operations are not included in discontinued operations.

    INTERTAN UPDATE
         InterTAN Inc. ("InterTAN"), the former foreign retail
    operations of Tandy, was spun off to Tandy stockholders as a
    tax-free dividend in fiscal 1987.  Under the merchandise
    purchase terms of the original distribution agreement,
    InterTAN could purchase on payment terms from Tandy, at
    negotiated prices, new and replacement models of products
    that Tandy had in its Radio Shack U.S. catalog or which Tandy
    may reasonably secure.  A&A International ("A&A"), a
    subsidiary of Tandy, was the exclusive purchasing agent for
    products originating in the Far East for InterTAN.

         On July 16, 1993 InterTAN had an account payable to
    Tandy of approximately $17,000,000 of which $7,600,000 was in
    default.  InterTAN's outstanding purchase orders for
    merchandise placed under the distribution agreement with
    Tandy, but not yet shipped, totaled approximately
    $44,000,000.  Because InterTAN had defaulted, on July 16
    Tandy terminated the merchandise purchase terms of the
    distribution agreement and the license agreements.  Tandy
    offered InterTAN interim license agreements which expired
    July 22, 1993, unless extended.  These were extended on July
    23, 1993.

         On July 30, 1993 Trans World Electronics, Inc. ("Trans
    World"), a subsidiary of Tandy, reached agreement with
    InterTAN's banking syndicate to buy approximately $42,000,000
    of InterTAN's debt at a negotiated, discounted price.  The
    closing of this purchase occurred on August 5, 1993, at which
    time Tandy resumed limited shipments to InterTAN and granted
    a series of short-term, interim licenses pending the
    execution of new license and merchandise agreements.  The
    debt purchased from the banks has been restructured into a
    seven-year note with interest of 8.64% due semiannually
    beginning February 25, 1994 and semiannual principal payments
    beginning February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).  Trans
    World also provided approximately $10,000,000 in working
    capital and trade credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the
    working capital loan (the "Series B" note) of 8.11% is due
    semiannually beginning February 25, 1994 with the principal
    due in full on August 25, 1996.  Trans World also has
    received warrants with a five-year term exercisable for
    approximately 1,450,000 shares of InterTAN common stock at an
    exercise price of $6.62 per share.  As required by an
    agreement with Trans World, InterTAN filed a registration
    statement on January 21, 1994 seeking to register the
    warrants under the Securities Act of 1933.

         In addition to the bank debt purchased by Trans World
    and the working capital loan, InterTAN's obligations to Trans
    World included two additional notes for approximately
    $23,665,000 (the "Series C" note) and $24,037,000 (the
    "Series D" note) with interest rates of 7.5% and 8%,
    respectively.  The notes represent the restructuring of
    InterTAN accounts payable for merchandise already shipped and
    require monthly interest payments.  Also, InterTAN had
    obligations for purchase orders outstanding for merchandise
    ordered by A&A for InterTAN but not yet shipped totaling
    approximately $31,262,000 at December 31, 1993.  All
    principal and interest on the Series C note was paid in full
    by December 31, 1993.  As merchandise under existing
    outstanding purchase orders is shipped, A&A will invoice
    InterTAN and amounts owed will be assigned to Trans World and
    will increase the amount of the Series D note.  The balance
    of the Series D note as of December 31, 1993 was
    approximately $7,500,000.  All of Tandy's debt from InterTAN
    is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of
    InterTAN's assets.

         A new merchandise agreement was reached with InterTAN in
    October 1993 which requires future purchase orders be backed
    by letters of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license
    agreements have been negotiated which provide for a future
    royalty to Tandy.

         As required by the various agreements now existing
    between Tandy and InterTAN, InterTAN has obtained a bank
    revolving credit facility for Canadian $30,000,000 (U.S.
    $22,662,000 equivalent at December 31, 1993).  Tandy has
    agreed with InterTAN's new banking agent,  that in case of
    InterTAN's default on the bank credit line, Tandy will, at
    the option of the bank, purchase InterTAN's inventory and
    related accounts receivable at 50% of their net book value,
    up to the amount of outstanding bank loans, but not to exceed
    Canadian $60,000,000 (U.S. $45,324,000 equivalent at December
    31, 1993).  In that event, Tandy could foreclose on its first
    priority lien on InterTAN's assets.  If Tandy fails to
    purchase the inventory and related accounts receivable of
    InterTAN from the bank, InterTAN's banking agent, upon notice
    to Tandy and expiration of time, can foreclose upon
    InterTAN's assets ahead of Tandy.  At December 31, 1993,
    InterTAN had no borrowings under this revolving credit
    facility.

         As of December 31,1993 InterTAN owed Tandy an aggregate
    of $63,511,000.  The current portion of the obligation
    approximates $11,650,000 and the non-current portion
    approximates $51,861,000.  In 1993 Tandy has not recognized
    any accretion of discount on the note receivable from
    InterTAN resulting from the purchase of the bank debt at a
    discounted price but will commence accretion of such discount
    in 1994 due to InterTAN's financial results and payment
    history as of December 31, 1993.  Accretion of this discount
    will be based on the effective interest rate method and will
    approximate $3,856,000 in 1994.  During the year ended
    December 31, 1993, Tandy recognized approximately $93,315,000
    of sales to InterTAN and interest income of $3,085,000.
    Tandy's sales to InterTAN totaled $90,130,000 during the six
    months ended December 31, 1992, $171,126,000 during fiscal
    1992, and $160,024,000 during fiscal 1991.

         A&A will continue as the exclusive purchasing agent for
    InterTAN in the Far East on a commission basis.  Commencing
    in March 1994 only the purchasing agent commission and sales
    by Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN will be recorded as
    sales.  InterTAN purchases from third parties through A&A
    will no longer be recorded as sales reflecting the
    arrangement under the new merchandise agreement. 
    Accordingly, management expects that reported sales by Tandy
    to InterTAN in 1994 will be considerably lower than in prior
    years, however, the earned income relating thereto will not
    be materially different.

         Separate financial statements of Tandy Corporation have
    been omitted because Tandy is primarily an operating company
    and the amount of restricted net assets of consolidated and
    unconsolidated subsidiaries and Tandy's equity in
    undistributed earnings of 50% or less-owned companies
    accounted for by the equity method are not significant.  All
    subsidiaries of Tandy Corporation are included in the
    consolidated financial statements.  Financial statements of
    50% or less-owned companies have been omitted because they do
    not, considered individually or in the aggregate, constitute
    a significant subsidiary.

         The financial statement schedules should be read in
    conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.  All
    other schedules have been omitted because they are not
    applicable, not required or the information is included in
    the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.


    <PAGE>
                REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

    To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
    Tandy Corporation

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed
    in the accompanying index on page 29 present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of Tandy
    Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December
    31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 1993, the
    six months ended December 31, 1992, and for each of the two
    years in the period ended June 30, 1992 in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company's
    management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
    these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted
    our audits of these statements in accordance with generally
    accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
    evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
    used and significant estimates made by management, and
    evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
    opinion expressed above.

    As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    income taxes in 1993 and for extended warranty and service
    contracts in fiscal 1991.

    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    Tandy Corporation and Subsidiaries

    NOTE 1-DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

         Tandy Corporation ("Tandy" or the "Company") is engaged
    in consumer electronics retailing including the retail sale
    of personal computers.  Radio Shack is the largest of Tandy's
    retail store systems with company-owned stores and
    dealer/franchise outlets.  The Tandy Name Brand Retail Group
    includes McDuff Electronics mall stores and Supercenters,
    VideoConcepts mall stores and The Edge in Electronics stores.
    Tandy also operates the Computer City and Incredible Universe
    store chains.  Additionally, Tandy continues to operate
    certain related retail support groups and consumer
    electronics manufacturing businesses.

    NOTE 2-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of Tandy and its wholly owned
    subsidiaries, including its credit and insurance
    subsidiaries.  Investments in 20% to 50% owned companies are
    accounted for on the equity method.  The manufacturing and
    marketing operations included in the divestment plan have
    been accounted for as discontinued operations.  See Note 3
    for further information relating to discontinued operations. 
    Significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in
    consolidation.

         CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR:  On January 10, 1993, the Board
    of Directors authorized the fiscal year of Tandy to be
    changed from June 30 to December 31 and as of December 31,
    1992 this change was made.  The fiscal periods of certain
    foreign operations end one month earlier than the Company's
    year end to facilitate their inclusion in the consolidated
    financial statements.

         FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:  In accordance with the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") Statement
    No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation," balance sheet
    accounts of the Company's foreign operations are translated
    from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at year end or
    historical rates while income and expenses are translated at
    the weighted average sales exchange rates for the year.
    Translation gains or losses related to net assets located
    outside the United States are shown as a separate component
    of stockholders' equity.  Losses aggregating $19,803,000, net
    of tax, relating to discontinued operations were transferred
    from equity and charged to loss on disposal of discontinued
    operations during 1993.  Gains and losses resulting from
    foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a
    currency other than the entity's functional currency) are
    included in net income.  Such foreign currency transaction
    gains approximated $762,000 for the year ended December 31,
    1993, $3,065,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1992
    and $10,642,000 and $13,051,000 for fiscal years 1992 and
    1991, respectively.

         CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE-PROVISION FOR INCOME
    TAXES:  In January 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 109, "Accounting
    for Income Taxes" ("FAS 109") and applied the provisions
    prospectively.  The adoption of FAS 109 changes the Company's
    method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred
    method ("APB 11") to an asset and liability approach.
    Previously, the Company deferred the past tax effects of
    timing differences between financial reporting and taxable
    income.  The asset and liability approach requires the
    recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
    expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
    between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities.

         The adjustments to the January 1, 1993 balance sheet to
    adopt FAS 109 totaled $13,014,000.  Approximately $9,786,000
    of this adjustment related to continuing operations and the
    remaining $3,228,000 was from discontinued operations.  The
    aggregate amount of $13,014,000 is reflected in the
    accompanying 1993 Consolidated Statements of Income as the
    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.  It
    primarily represents the impact of adjusting deferred taxes
    to reflect the then current tax rate of 34% as opposed to the
    higher tax rates that were in effect when the deferred taxes
    originated.  See Note 12 for further discussion of income
    taxes.

         CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE-EXTENDED WARRANTY AND
    SERVICE CONTRACTS:  Tandy's retail operations offer extended
    warranty and service contracts on products sold.  These
    contracts generally provide extended warranty coverage for
    periods of 12 to 48 months.

         The FASB issued Technical Bulletin No. 90-1, "Accounting
    for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product
    Maintenance Contracts" in December 1990.  This bulletin
    requires revenues from sales of extended warranty and service
    contracts to be recognized ratably over the lives of the
    contracts.  Costs directly related to sales of such contracts
    are to be deferred and charged to expense proportionately as
    the revenues are recognized.  A loss is recognized on
    extended warranty and service contracts if the sum of the
    expected costs of providing services under the contracts
    exceeds related unearned revenue.

         During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1991, the Company
    elected to adopt this technical bulletin on a retroactive
    basis to the beginning of fiscal 1991 by restating the
    previously reported three quarters.  The method of adoption
    included the application of this accounting change to all
    existing contracts outstanding at July 1, 1990 and to all
    contracts entered into during fiscal 1991.  Prior to the
    adoption of this technical bulletin, the Company had
    recognized a portion of the extended warranty and service
    contract revenues immediately, deferred the remaining
    revenues which were recognized ratably over their contract
    lives and expensed associated costs as incurred.

         The effect of this change for fiscal 1991 was to
    decrease income before the cumulative effect of the change in
    accounting by $3,708,000 ($.05 per share).  The cumulative
    effect of the change on years prior to 1991, net of income
    taxes of $5,471,000, was to decrease 1991 net income by
    $10,619,000 ($.14 per share).

         CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS:  Cash on hand in
    stores, deposits in banks and short-term investments with
    original maturities of three months or less are considered
    cash and cash equivalents.  Short-term investments are
    carried at cost, which approximates market value.

         ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS:
           CREDIT OPERATIONS-The customer receivables of the
    credit operations are classified as current assets, including
    amounts which are contractually due after one year.  This is
    consistent with retail industry practices.

         Finance charges, late charges and returned check fees
    arising from the Company's private label credit cards are
    recognized when earned, as interest income.  The Company's
    policy is to write off accounts after 210 days past the
    initial billing date without payment of the amount due or
    whenever deemed uncollectible by management, whichever is
    sooner.  Collection efforts continue subsequent to write-off.

         The Company is charged a fee by an outside accounts
    receivable processing service for establishing new accounts.
    These initial direct costs are capitalized and amortized on a
    straight-line basis over a period of 84 months, the estimated
    life over which the account will be used by a customer. These
    costs are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets as a part of the related accounts receivable.
    Amortization of these loan origination costs are included as
    a reduction of interest income in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of income.  Costs to process accounts
    on an ongoing basis are expensed as incurred.

           OTHER CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES-An allowance for doubtful
    accounts is provided when accounts are determined to be
    uncollectible.

         Concentrations of credit risk with respect to customer
    receivables are limited due to the large number of customers
    comprising the Company's base and their location in many
    different geographic areas of the country.

         INVENTORIES:  Inventories are stated at the lower of
    cost (principally based on average cost) or market value.

         PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:  For financial reporting
    purposes, depreciation and amortization are primarily
    calculated using the straight-line method, which amortizes
    the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives. The
    ranges of estimated useful lives are:
    _____________________________________________________________
    Buildings. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .10-40 years
    Equipment. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2-15 years
    Leasehold improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . .the shorter
                         of the life of the improvements or the
          term of the related lease and certain renewal periods
    _____________________________________________________________

         When depreciable assets are sold or retired, the related
    cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts.  Any gains or losses are included in selling,
    general and administrative expenses.  Major additions and
    betterments are capitalized.  Maintenance and repairs which
    do not materially improve or extend the lives of the
    respective assets are charged to operating expenses as
    incurred.

         AMORTIZATION OF EXCESS PURCHASE PRICE OVER NET TANGIBLE
    ASSETS OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED:  The excess purchase price is
    generally amortized over a 40-year period using the
    straight-line method and is classified as a non-current
    asset.

         FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  The fair value of
    financial instruments is determined by reference to various
    market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate.
    Unless otherwise disclosed, the fair values of financial
    instruments approximate their recorded values.

         REVENUES:  Retail sales are recorded on the accrual
    basis.  Credit service charges are recorded monthly on the
    basis of customer account balances.

         PRE-STORE OPENING EXPENSES:  Direct incremental expenses
    associated with the openings of new stores are deferred and
    amortized over a twelve-month period from the date of the
    store opening.

         NET INCOME PER AVERAGE COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT
    SHARE:  Net income per average common and common equivalent
    share is computed by dividing net income less the Series B
    convertible stock dividends, net of taxes, by the weighted
    average common and common equivalent shares outstanding
    during the period.  Current year weighted average share
    calculations include 12,457,000 common shares relating to the
    Preferred Equity Redemption Convertible Preferred Stock
    ("PERCS"). Per share amounts and the weighted average number
    of shares outstanding for the six-month period ended December
    31, 1992 and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1992, have
    been retroactively restated to reflect the assumption that
    the PERCS would convert into 12,457,000 common shares in lieu
    of the maximum number of common shares of 15,000,000.  The
    reduction is based upon Tandy's common stock price at
    December 31, 1993 being in excess of the conversion strike
    price thereby reducing the number of common shares that would
    be issued to PERCS shareholders upon conversion.  Earnings
    per share amounts previously reported by the Company for the
    six months ended December 31, 1992 and the fiscal year ended
    June 30, 1992 were $0.84 and $2.58 for income from continuing
    operations, respectively, and $0.02 and $2.24 for net income,
    respectively.  Fiscal 1991 and 1990 were not effected as the
    PERCS were not outstanding during these years.

         The Series B convertible stock dividends, net of taxes,
    were $7,136,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993,
    $2,419,000 for the six months ended December 31, 1992,
    $4,911,000 in fiscal 1992 and $4,538,000 in fiscal 1991.  The
    taxes netted against these amounts were $0, $1,246,000,
    $2,530,000 and $2,337,000, respectively.  Upon adoption of
    FAS 109 as of January 1, 1993 and in accordance with EITF
    92-3, preferred dividends utilized in the earnings per share
    calculation can no longer be reduced for associated tax
    benefits paid on unallocated preferred stock held by an
    employee stock ownership plan.

         As the Series C PERCS mandatorily convert into common
    stock, they are considered outstanding common stock and the
    dividends are not deducted from net income for purposes of
    calculating net income per average common and common
    equivalent share.  Dividends on the Series C PERCS, which
    were issued in February 1992, were $32,100,000 for the year
    ended December 31, 1993, $16,050,000 for the six months ended
    December 31, 1992 and $12,573,000 for the year ended June 30,
    1992.

         Fully diluted earnings per common and common equivalent
    share are not presented since dilution is less than 3%.

    NOTE 3-DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
         On June 25, 1993, the Board of Directors of Tandy
    adopted a formal plan of divestiture under which it would
    sell its computer manufacturing and marketing businesses, the
    O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ready-to-assemble furniture
    manufacturing and related marketing business, the Memtek
    Products division and the Lika printed circuit board
    business.  The divestiture plan replaced the Company's plan
    to spin off all of the Company's manufacturing and marketing
    businesses as described in Tandy's Transition Report on Form
    10-K/A-4 for the six-month period ended December 31, 1992. In
    connection with the plan of divestiture the Company accounted
    for the divestiture of these businesses as discontinued
    operations and recognized an after-tax charge of $70,000,000
    in its quarter ended June 30, 1993.  This charge was
    subsequently reduced by approximately $15,822,000 in the
    quarter ended December 31, 1993.  The reduction of the
    reserve previously taken resulted from the better than
    anticipated sales price received for O'Sullivan Industries
    Holdings, Inc. partially offset by additional foreign
    currency translation losses and below plan operating results
    of the divested companies during the divestment period, net
    of related income tax adjustments.  Prior year results of
    operations have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued
    operations treatment.

              Computer Manufacturing.  In furtherance of the
         divestiture plan, the Company closed the sale of the
         computer manufacturing and marketing businesses to AST
         Research, Inc. ("AST") on July 13, 1993.  In accordance
         with the terms of the definitive agreement between Tandy
         and AST, Tandy received $15,000,000 upon closing of the
         sale.  The balance of the purchase price of $90,000,000
         (as adjusted post-closing based on the results of an
         audit of the assets and liabilities conveyed) is payable
         by a promissory note.  The promissory note is payable in
         three years and interest is accrued and paid annually.
         The interest rate on the promissory note is currently
         3.75% per annum and is adjusted annually, not to exceed
         5% per annum.  The terms of the promissory note
         stipulate that the outstanding principal balance may be
         paid at maturity at AST's option in cash or the common
         stock of AST.  However, at Tandy's option not more than
         50% of the initial principal balance may be paid in
         common stock of AST.  The promissory note is supported
         by a standby letter of credit in the amount of the
         lesser of $100,000,000 or 70% of the outstanding
         principal amount of the promissory note.  At December
         31, 1993, the standby letter of credit approximated
         $67,704,000.  Accounts receivable relating to the
         computer operations, approximating $83,000,000 at June
         30, 1993, inured to the benefit of Tandy upon
         collection.  At December 31, 1993, the balance of the
         remaining accounts receivable, net of allowance for
         doubtful accounts, was $7,700,000.  Tandy also retained
         certain inventory which it intends to liquidate before
         June 30, 1994.  At December 31, 1993, this inventory
         amounted to approximately $3,700,000.

              In October 1993, the Company sold its computer
         marketing operations in France to AST, together with
         certain other multimedia assets and additional Swedish
         inventory, for an aggregate of approximately $6,700,000,
         which was evidenced by an increase in the amount of the
         promissory note described above to $96,700,000.  The
         Company has discounted this note by $2,000,000 and the
         discount will be recognized as income using the
         effective interest rate method over the life of the
         note.

              Memtek Products.  On November 10, 1993, the Company
         executed a definitive agreement with Hanny Magnetics
         (B.V.I.) Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation
         ("Hanny") to purchase certain assets of the Company's
         Memtek Products operations, including the license
         agreement with Memorex Telex, N.V. for the use of the
         Memorex trademark on licensed consumer electronics
         products.  This sale closed on December 16, 1993.  As of
         December 31, 1993, Tandy has received payments of
         $62,500,000, recorded a $7,102,000 receivable from Hanny
         for the remaining purchase price and retained
         approximately $61,000,000 in accounts receivable and
         certain other assets for liquidation.  Hanny is a
         subsidiary of Hanny Magnetics (Holdings) Limited, a
         Bermuda corporation, listed on the Hong Kong Stock
         Exchange.  At December 31, 1993, accounts receivable,
         net of related allowance for doubtful accounts,
         retained by Tandy approximated $40,100,000.

              O'Sullivan Industries.  On November 23, 1993, the
         Company announced that it would sell the common stock of
         O'Sullivan Industries, Inc. ("O'Sullivan") in an initial
         public offering.  On January 27, 1994 the Company
         announced that it had reached an agreement with the
         underwriters to sell O'Sullivan Industries Holdings,
         Inc., the parent company of O'Sullivan, common stock to
         the public at $22 per share.  The net proceeds realized
         by Tandy in the initial public offering, together with
         the $40,000,000 cash dividend from O'Sullivan,
         approximated $350,000,000.  The initial public offering
         closed on February 2, 1994.

              Pursuant to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit
         Reimbursement Agreement between Tandy and O'Sullivan
         Industries Holdings, Inc., the Company will receive
         payments from O'Sullivan resulting from an increased tax
         basis of O'Sullivan's assets thereby increasing tax
         deductions and accordingly, reducing income taxes
         payable by O'Sullivan.  The amount to be received by the
         Company each year will approximate the federal tax
         benefit expected to be realized with respect to the
         increased tax basis.  These payments will be made over a
         15-year time period.  The Company will recognize these
         payments as additional sale proceeds and gain in the
         year in which the payments become due and payable to the
         Company.

              Lika.  On January 24, 1994, the Company announced
         that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its
         manufacturing facilities which make Lika printed
         circuit boards.  This divestiture is expected to close
         by June 1994 and is expected to yield approximately
         $17,000,000 in proceeds, including cash, a note and the
         liquidation of certain retained assets.

         In connection with the computer manufacturing sale and
    the Memtek Products sale, the Company agreed to retain
    certain liabilities primarily relating to warranty
    obligations on products sold prior to the sale.  Management
    believes that accrued reserves, as reflected on its December
    31, 1993 balance sheet, are adequate to cover estimated
    future warranty obligations for the products and for any
    remaining costs to dispose of these operations.

         With the closing of the Lika transaction, the
    divestiture program announced in June 1993 will be complete. 
    Proceeds from the formal divestiture plan should total
    approximately $715,000,000 including net income tax benefits
    of $16,600,000 and notes receivable of approximately
    $100,000,000 that mature by the end of 1996.  The proceeds
    from the divestitures are being used to reduce short-term
    debt and for the expansion of the Incredible Universe and
    Computer City store operations.

         The losses from discontinued operations prior to the
    measurement date are outlined in the table below.

    manufacturing operations to AST, inclusive of losses from
    operations during the phase out period, is offset by the
    gains from the sale of Memtek Products, O'Sullivan and Lika,
    also inclusive of results of operations during the phase out
    period.

         Interest expense of $4,608,000 allocated through the
    measurement date of June 30, 1993 and $5,170,000 for the six
    months ended December 31, 1992, have been allocated to
    discontinued operations based on the percentage of the net
    assets of discontinued operations to total net assets.

         At December 31, 1993 net assets of discontinued
    operations consist primarily of inventories, accounts
    receivable and property, plant and equipment, primarily
    relating to O'Sullivan and Lika operations.

    NOTE 4-RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

         The Company adopted a plan resulting in business
    restructuring charges during the six months ended December
    31, 1992 designed to improve the Company's competitiveness
    and future profitability.  The pre-tax charge of $48,000,000
    related primarily to the closing of approximately 110 of the
    432 Tandy Name Brand Retail Group stores, mainly McDuff
    Supercenters in major market areas and, to a lesser extent,
    the elimination of certain product lines.  Some product lines
    were reduced or eliminated after consideration of competitive
    factors and market trends.  Additional restructuring charges
    of $39,500,000 related to discontinued operations were
    recognized in the six months ending December 31, 1992 and
    primarily related to the write-off of goodwill, the
    rationalization of certain product lines and the closure of
    certain operations.  This restructuring charge is included in
    the operating loss from discontinued operations.

         In fiscal 1991 an $8,531,000 charge was incurred for
    restructuring. The charges consisted principally of costs
    associated with closings of Radio Shack computer centers. 
    Restructuring charges relating to continuing operations are
    presented in the accompanying income statements as a separate
    line item.

    NOTE 5-SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

         The weighted average interest rate was 3.2% at December
    31, 1993 for short-term investments totaling $153,839,000.
    The weighted average interest rate was 3.5% at December 31,
    1992 for short-term investments totaling $40,913,000.

         Effective May 1, 1991, the Company transferred
    $573,500,000 of its customer receivables to a trust which, in
    turn, on June 18, 1991, sold $350,000,000 of certificates
    representing undivided interests in the trust in a public
    offering.  Net proceeds from the sale of receivables
    approximated $346,000,000 and the Company recognized a gain
    of approximately $3,900,000 related to the transaction.  At
    December 31, 1993 and 1992, all $350,000,000 of the
    certificates were outstanding and, accordingly, were not
    reflected in the Company's accounts receivable balances.  The
    fair value of the certificates at December 31, 1993 was
    approximately $367,815,000.  At December 31, 1993, the
    balance of the receivables in the trust approximated
    $651,700,000.  The Company owns the remaining undivided
    interest in the trust not represented by the certificates and
    will continue to service the receivables for the trust.

         Cash flows generated from the receivables in the trust
    are dedicated to the payment of interest on the certificates
    which have an annual fixed interest rate of 8.25%, absorption
    of defaulted accounts in the trust and payment of servicing
    fees to the Company with any remaining cash flows remitted to
    the Company.  In the event that such excess cash flows are
    not sufficient to absorb defaulted accounts, the Company is
    contingently liable up to a maximum amount of $136,100,000.

         Under this agreement the trust may issue additional
    series of certificates from time to time.  Terms of any
    future series will be determined at the time of issuance.

    respectively.  The balance at December 31, 1993 includes
    long-term receivables relating to InterTAN and AST of
    $126,384,000, net of discount of $22,198,000.  See Notes 3
    and 21 for a further description of the terms of the AST and
    InterTAN notes receivable.  The balance at December 31, 1992
    includes other assets relating to discontinued operations of
    approximately $207,864,000.

    NOTE 9-INDEBTEDNESS AND BORROWING FACILITIES

         Borrowings payable within one year are summarized in the
    accompanying short-term debt table on page 45.  The
    short-term debt caption includes primarily domestic seasonal
    borrowings.  The current portion of long-term debt at
    December 31, 1993 includes $82,701,000 of medium-term notes
    and other loans compared to $48,696,000 at December 31, 1992.
    The short-term debt additionally includes $31,739,000 of 10%
    subordinated debentures due June 30, 1994.  This subordinated
    debenture has been called by the Company for redemption on
    April 1, 1994.

         Tandy's short-term credit facilities, including
    revolving credit lines, are summarized in the accompanying
    short-term borrowing facilities table found on page 46.

         A commercial paper program was established during fiscal
    1991 for Tandy. The Company has a $400,000,000 committed
    facility in place for the commercial paper program.  This
    facility is to be used only if maturing commercial paper
    cannot be repaid due to an inability to sell new paper. This
    facility is composed of two tranches of $200,000,000 each
    expiring in June 1994 with annual commitment fees for the
    tranches of 1/10 of 1% per annum and 3/20 of 1% per annum,
    respectively, whether used or unused.  The commercial paper
    facility limits the amount of commercial paper that may be
    outstanding to a maximum of $400,000,000.

         Long-term debt at December 31, 1993 and December 31,
    1992 totaled $186,638,000 and $322,778,000, respectively.
    Included in both years are $45,000,000 of 8.69% senior notes
    due January 15, 1995.  These senior notes have been
    outstanding since February 7, 1990.

         Tandy completed a $500,000,000 shelf registration in
    January 1991 of which $400,000,000 was designated for
    medium-term notes.  Tandy Credit's $400,000,000 shelf
    registration was amended in October 1990 to add a
    $200,000,000 Series B medium-term note program.  At December
    31, 1993 available borrowing capacity under Tandy's and Tandy
    Credit's medium-term note programs aggregated $429,200,000.
    Medium-term notes outstanding at December 31, 1993 totaled
    $125,479,00 compared 6to $148,900,000 at December 31, 1992.
    The weighted average coupon rates of medium-term notes
    outstanding at both of these dates was 8.7%.

         The Company established an employee stock ownership
    trust in June 1990.  Further information on the trust and its
    related indebtedness, which is guaranteed by the Company, is
    detailed in the discussion of the Tandy Employees Stock
    Ownership Plan in Note 14.

    NOTE 10-LEASES

         Tandy leases rather than owns most of its facilities.
    The Radio Shack stores comprise the largest portion of
    Tandy's leased facilities.  The Radio Shack, Tandy Name Brand
    Retail Group and Computer City stores are located primarily
    in major shopping malls, shopping centers or freestanding
    facilities owned by other companies.  The Company owns most
    of the Incredible Universe stores.  The store leases are
    generally based on a minimum rental plus a percentage of the
    store's sales in excess of a stipulated base figure.  Radio
    Shack store leases average approximately 10 years, generally
    with renewal options.  Tandy also leases distribution centers
    and office space.  Capital leases are not material as the
    Company's operations are basically structured in a manner
    that precludes the need for significant financing or capital
    leases.

         Future minimum rent commitments at December 31, 1993 for
    all long-term noncancelable leases (net of immaterial amounts
    of sublease rent income) are in the following table.

         As of December 31, 1993, the Company has tax net
    operating loss carryforwards of approximately $20,659,000
    which are available to offset future taxable income.  These
    carryforwards which are expected to be fully utilized, expire
    beginning in the year ending December 31, 2006.  Accordingly,
    the Company has recognized a deferred tax asset relating to
    these carryforwards.

         In January 1993, the Company adopted FAS No. 109.  The
    adoption of FAS 109 changes the Company's method of
    accounting for income taxes from the deferred method ("APB
    11") to an asset and liability approach.  Previously, the
    Company deferred the past tax effects of timing differences
    between financial reporting and taxable income.  The asset
    and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred
    tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
    amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.

         The adjustments to the January 1, 1993 balance sheet to
    adopt FAS 109 totaled $13,014,000.  Approximately $9,786,000
    of this adjustment related to continuing operations and the
    remaining $3,228,000 was from discontinued operations.  The
    aggregate amount of $13,014,000 is reflected in 1993 net
    income as the cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle.  It primarily represents the impact of adjusting
    deferred taxes to reflect the then current tax rate of 34% as
    opposed to the higher tax rates that were in effect when the
    deferred taxes originated.  The Company subsequently
    increased its U.S. deferred tax asset in 1993 as a result of
    legislation enacted during 1993 which increased the corporate
    tax rate from 34% to 35%.  Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities as of December 31, 1993 for continuing operations
    were comprised of the following:

    least six months.  Each participant may contribute 1% to 10%
    of annual compensation, except that the President of the
    Company may limit the maximum contribution for employees of
    certain divisions or subsidiaries to a percentage less than
    10%.  The Company matches 40%, 60% or 80% of the employee's
    contribution depending on the length of the employee's
    participation in the program.  The Company periodically
    purchases common stock on the open market and then sells the
    number of shares required by the program each month at a
    price equal to the average of the daily closing prices for
    that month.  The stock purchased by each participant is
    distributed annually after December 31.  In the event of a
    tender offer (other than an issuer tender offer) or a change
    in control, as defined in the program, all stock credited to
    participants' accounts will be distributed to the
    participants.  If the Company elects, treasury shares or
    authorized but unissued shares may be used.  Tandy's
    contributions to the stock purchase program were $18,955,000
    for the year ended December 31, 1993 and $8,756,000 for the
    six months ended December 31, 1992.  For fiscal 1992 and 1991
    the Company's contributions were $20,253,000 and $19,614,000,
    respectively.

         TANDY EMPLOYEES DEFERRED SALARY AND INVESTMENT PLAN. The
    Plan became effective on July 1, 1982.  An eligible employee
    electing to participate in this plan may defer 5% of annual
    compensation, subject to certain limitations established by
    the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  The Company pays this amount
    into the plan as a deferred salary contribution for the
    account of the employee. The employee's 5% contribution is
    considered deferred compensation and is not taxed to the
    employee as long as it remains in the plan.  Prior to October
    1, 1990, the Company matched 80% of the employee's deferred
    salary contribution.  This matching contribution ceased on
    September 30, 1990.  Beginning October 1990, the Company
    began making contributions to the newly formed employee stock
    ownership plan described in Note 14 in lieu of the matching
    contributions to the deferred salary and investment plan.  To
    participate in the employee stock ownership plan, employees
    must continue to make deferred salary contributions to the
    Tandy Employees Deferred Salary and Investment Plan.  The
    plan is available to most employees who have been employed at
    least one year.  The contributions made by the Company until
    the employee stock ownership plan became effective October 1,
    1990 were fully vested upon payment to the trustee.  In June
    1992, the Company received a determination letter ruling that
    the Tandy Employees Deferred Salary and Investment Plan is a
    qualified 401(k) plan.  An administrative committee appointed
    by the Board of Directors invests the plan's assets.  A
    substantial majority of the plan's assets are invested in
    Tandy securities.  The Company's contribution to the
    investment plan from July 1, 1990 through September 30, 1990
    was $3,401,000.

    NOTE 14-TANDY EMPLOYEES STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

         As a continuation of the Company's programs to encourage
    employee ownership of Tandy stock, the Company formed the
    Tandy Employees Stock Ownership Plan and trust (the "TESOP")
    on June 28, 1990.  On July 31, 1990, the TESOP trustee
    borrowed $100,000,000 at an interest rate of 9.34% with
    varying semi-annual principal payments through June 30, 2000.
    Dividend payments and contributions from Tandy will be used
    to repay the indebtedness.  Because Tandy has guaranteed the
    repayment of these notes, the indebtedness of the TESOP is
    recognized as a long-term obligation in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.  An offsetting charge has been
    made in the stockholders' equity section of the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet to reflect unearned compensation
    related to the TESOP.

         The TESOP trustee used the proceeds from the issuance of
    the notes to purchase 100,000 shares of Series B TESOP
    Convertible Preferred Stock (the "TESOP Preferred Stock")
    from Tandy at a price of $1,000 per share.  Each share of
    such stock is convertible into 21.768 shares of Tandy common
    stock.  The number of shares of Company common stock into
    which each share of the TESOP Preferred Stock is convertible
    ("the Conversion Price") is subject to anti-dilution
    adjustment upon the occurrence of a number of corporate
    events.  The annual cumulative dividend on TESOP Preferred
    Stock is $75.00 per share, payable semi-annually.  This
    series of stock has certain liquidation preferences and may
    be redeemed by Tandy after July 1, 1994 at specified
    premiums.  The TESOP Preferred Stock will be held by the
    trustee until redemption or conversion and may not be sold or
    distributed outside the TESOP except for resale to Tandy. The
    TESOP requires that shares of TESOP Preferred Stock not yet
    allocated to any participant's account, as well as allocated
    shares for which no voting instructions are received, be
    voted by the trustee in proportion to the votes cast with
    respect to allocated shares of TESOP Preferred Stock.

         Participants in the Tandy Employees Deferred Salary and
    Investment Plan became eligible to participate in the TESOP
    effective October 1, 1990.  At that time the Company began
    making payments to the TESOP in lieu of its matching
    contributions to the Tandy Employees Deferred Salary and
    Investment Plan.  During the term of the TESOP, the TESOP
    Preferred Stock will be allocated to the participants
    semi-annually based on the principal payments made on the
    indebtedness.  The allocations to the individual
    participants' accounts are determined according to the terms
    of the TESOP.  As vested participants withdraw from the
    TESOP, payments are made in cash or Tandy common stock.  The
    preferred stock has a face value of $1,000 per share and the
    Company is obligated to redeem the preferred stock at the
    higher of the appraised value or $1,000 per share in the
    event of a participant's withdrawal.  The Company has the
    option to redeem the preferred stock in either cash or common
    stock.  Participants in the TESOP that were hired prior to
    October 1, 1990 became immediately vested in all allocations
    made to their accounts.  Employees hired after September 30,
    1990 who become TESOP participants will become vested in
    amounts allocated to their accounts upon the earlier of three
    years of participation in the TESOP or the completion of five
    years of employment with the Company.  Forfeited shares are
    returned to the TESOP and allocated to the accounts of other
    participants.

         In June 1992 the Company received a determination letter
    ruling from the IRS that the TESOP was a qualified employee
    stock ownership plan.

         In fiscal 1991 Tandy recorded, as a component of
    stockholders' equity, $100,000,000 of unearned compensation
    to reflect the value of the TESOP Preferred Stock sold to the
    TESOP.  As shares of the TESOP Preferred Stock are allocated
    to the TESOP participants, compensation expense is recorded
    and unearned compensation is reduced.  Interest expense on
    the TESOP notes is also recognized as a cost of the TESOP.
    The compensation component of the TESOP expense is reduced by
    the amount of dividends accrued on the TESOP Preferred Stock
    with any dividends in excess of the compensation expense
    reflected as a reduction of interest expense.  During the
    year ended December 31, 1993, the compensation and interest
    costs related to the TESOP before the reduction for the
    allocation of dividends were $9,605,000 and $7,195,000,
    respectively.  During the six months ended December 31, 1992,
    the compensation and interest costs related to the TESOP
    before the reduction for the allocation of dividends were
    $4,266,000 and $3,969,000, respectively.  Such amounts for
    fiscal 1992 were $8,233,000 and $8,526,000, respectively. For
    the fiscal year ended June 30, 1991, these amounts were
    $5,967,000 and $8,488,000, respectively.  Contributions from
    Tandy to the TESOP for the year ended December 31, 1993 and
    the six months ended December 31, 1992 totaled $17,895,000
    and $9,269,000, respectively, including the $7,135,000 and
    $3,665,000 of dividends paid on the TESOP Preferred Stock.
    Contributions for the year ended June 30, 1992 totaled
    $16,926,000, including the $7,441,000 of dividends paid on
    the TESOP Preferred Stock. The fiscal 1991 cash contributions
    were $15,108,000, including $6,875,000 of dividends paid on
    the TESOP Preferred Stock.

         At September 30, 1993, 25,620 shares of TESOP Preferred
    Stock had been released and allocated to participants'
    accounts in the TESOP (including 6,093 shares which had been
    withdrawn by participants).  During the six months ended
    December 31, 1993, 5,400 shares of TESOP Preferred Stock were
    released for allocation to participants at March 31, 1994. 
    At December 31, 1993, 68,980 shares of TESOP Preferred Stock
    were available for later release and allocation to
    participants over the remaining life of the TESOP.

         Under the terms of Tandy's guarantee of the notes, Tandy
    is obligated to make annual contributions to the TESOP to
    enable it to pay principal and interest on the debt
    securities.  Tandy has fully and unconditionally guaranteed
    the TESOP's payment obligations, whether at maturity, upon
    redemption, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise.
    The holders of the notes have no recourse against the assets
    of the TESOP except in the event that the TESOP defaults on
    payments due and then only to the extent that the TESOP holds
    cash payments made by Tandy to the TESOP to enable it to meet
    its obligations under the notes and any earnings attributable
    to such contributions.  No amounts were in default as of
    December 31, 1993.

         The TESOP fiscal year ends on March 31.  At March 31,
    1993, the TESOP held as assets $97,725,000 of TESOP Preferred
    Stock and $4,511,000 of receivables and had liabilities
    comprised of the remaining principal on the notes of
    $79,680,000 and accrued interest payable on the notes of
    $1,861,000, resulting in net assets of $20,695,000.

    NOTE 15-STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS

         1985 Stock Option Plan
         ______________________
         Under the 1985 Stock Option Plan, as amended, options to
    acquire up to 2,000,000 shares of Tandy's common stock may be
    granted to officers and key management employees of the
    Company.  The shares authorized for issuance under the Plan
    upon the exercising of an option have been registered with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Organization and
    Compensation Committee (the "Committee") has sole discretion
    in determining whether to grant options, who shall receive
    them, the number of options granted to any individual and
    whether an option will be an incentive stock option or a
    nonstatutory stock option.  The term of incentive stock
    options may not exceed 10 years and the term of nonstatutory
    stock options may not exceed a term of 10 years plus one
    month.  No option may be exercised within one year of the
    date of grant and then may be exercised in specified
    installments only after stated intervals of time.

         The maximum amount that may be exercised at the
    expiration of each of the first through fifth anniversaries
    of the nonstatutory stock options is 20%.  On each of the
    first three anniversaries of the date of grant of the
    incentive stock options, one-third of each individual's
    options become exercisable.  Upon termination of employment,
    the optionee must exercise all currently vested options by
    the earlier of the option expiration date(s) or three months
    from the date of termination of employment or forfeit such
    options, except that upon retirement at age 55 or older the
    three months is extended to 12 months in the case of
    nonstatutory stock options only. Notwithstanding the grant of
    options initially exercisable in installments, upon the
    termination of employment as a result of death or total
    disability of an optionee, all options then held shall for a
    period of 12 months, subject to earlier termination at the
    fixed expiration date, become immediately exercisable without
    regard to dates at which the installments are exercisable.
    Upon the retirement of an optionee at age 55 or older, the
    Committee may in its discretion accelerate the dates at which
    remaining installments of options may be exercised to the
    date of retirement.  In the event of a change in control, all
    outstanding options become immediately exercisable for the
    full number of shares subject to options.  The option price
    was determined by the Committee at the time the option is
    granted, but the option price will not be less than 100% of
    the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant.
    Since the option prices have been fixed at the market price
    on the date of grant, no compensation has been charged
    against earnings by the Company.  Authorized and unissued
    shares or treasury stock may be issued to participants when
    options are exercised.

         The 1985 Stock Option Plan provides for adjustments to
    be made to options outstanding under the plan in order to
    prevent dilution of options upon the occurrence of a number
    of events, including the distribution of shares of a
    subsidiary of the Company to its stockholders.

         Tandy assumed an option plan which had been created by
    GRiD prior to its acquisition.  All unexercised GRiD options
    expired June 30, 1993.  Under the 1985 Stock Option Plan
    there were 1,268,205 vested options which could have been
    exercised for a total price of $44,710,134 at December 31,
    1993.  Shares available for additional grants under the 1985
    Stock Option Plan were 138,599 at December 31, 1993.

         1993 Incentive Stock Plan
         _________________________
         During March 1993, the Board adopted the Tandy
    Corporation 1993 Incentive Stock Plan (the "1993 Plan").  The
    1993 Plan was approved by stockholders in October 1993.
    Certain provisions of the 1993 Plan were amended by the Board
    on October 15, 1993.  The 1993 Plan is administered by the
    Organization and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of
    the Board.  A total of 3,000,000 shares of the Company's
    common stock were reserved for issuance under the 1993 Plan
    and have been registered with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission.

         The 1993 Plan permits the grant of incentive stock
    options ("ISOs"), nonstatutory stock options (options which
    are not ISOs) ("NSOs"), stock appreciation rights ("SARs"),
    restricted stock, performance units or performance shares.

         Grants of options under the 1993 Plan shall be for terms
    specified by the Committee, except that the term shall not
    exceed 10 years (5 years if granted to a 10% or more
    stockholder of the Company's common stock).  Subject to the
    discretion of the Committee, options become exercisable in
    such installments and at such times payments for shares
    issuable upon exercise of an option may be made in cash,
    common stock, or a combination of both.  The amount payable
    upon exercise of a SAR may be made at the discretion of the
    Committee either in cash or common stock or in a combination
    of cash and common stock.  Provisions of the 1993 Plan
    generally  provide that in the event of a change in control
    all options become immediately and fully exercisable and all
    restrictions lapse on restricted stock.

         As part of the 1993 Plan, each non-employee director of
    the Company receives a grant of NSOs for 3,000 shares of the
    Company's common stock on the first business day of September
    of each year ("Director Options").  Director Options have an
    exercise price of 100% of the fair market value of the
    Company's common stock on the trading day prior to the date
    of grant, vest as to one-third of the shares annually on the
    first three anniversary dates of the date of grant and expire
    10 years after the date of grant.  The first grant of the
    Director Options was made on September 1, 1993.

         The exercise price of an option (other than a Director
    Option) is determined by the Committee, provided that the
    exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market
    value of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of
    grant.

         At December 31, 1993 there were no vested options which
    could have been exercised and 2,650,050 shares available for
    additional grants under the 1993 Plan.  The 1993 Plan shall
    terminate on the tenth anniversary of the day preceding the
    date of its adoption by the Board and no option or award
    shall be granted under the 1993 Plan thereafter.

         Stock option activity from June 30, 1990 through
    December 31, 1993, including the exercise of GRiD options, is
    summarized in the accompanying chart.

    NOTE 16-PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

         In August 1986 the Board of Directors adopted a
    stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one right
    for each outstanding share of Tandy common stock.  The Board
    amended the rights plan in June 1988 and amended and restated
    the rights plan in June 1990.  The rights, which will expire
    on June 22, 2000, are currently represented by the common
    stock certificates and when they become exercisable will
    entitle holders to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of
    Tandy Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for an
    exercise price of $140 (subject to adjustment).  The rights
    will become exercisable and will trade separately from the
    common stock only upon the date of public announcement that a
    person, entity or group ("Person") has acquired 15% or more
    of Tandy's outstanding common stock without the prior consent
    or approval of the disinterested directors ("Acquiring
    Person") or ten days after the commencement or public
    announcement of a tender or exchange offer which would result
    in any person becoming an Acquiring Person.  In the event
    that any person becomes an Acquiring Person, the rights will
    be exercisable for 60 days thereafter for Tandy common stock
    with a prior market value (as determined under the rights
    plan) equal to twice the exercise price.  In the event that,
    after any person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Company
    engages in certain mergers, consolidations, or sales of
    assets representing 50% or more of its assets or earning
    power with an Acquiring Person (or persons acting on behalf
    of or in concert with an Acquiring Person) or in which all
    holders of common stock are not treated alike, the rights
    will be exercisable for common stock of the acquiring or
    surviving company with a prior market value (as determined
    under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise price. 
    The rights will not be exercisable by any Acquiring Person. 
    The rights are redeemable at a price of $.05 per right prior
    to any person becoming an Acquiring Person or, under certain
    circumstances, after the expiration of the 60-day period
    described above, but the rights may not be redeemed or the
    rights plan amended for 180 days following a change in a
    majority of the members of the Board (or if certain
    agreements are entered into during such 180-day period).


    NOTE 17-TERMINATION PROTECTION PLANS

         In August 1990, the Board of Directors of the Company
    approved termination protection plans and amendments to
    various other benefit plans including the stock purchase
    program and deferred salary and investment plan described in
    Note 13.  These plans provide for defined termination
    benefits to be paid to eligible employees of the Company who
    have been terminated, without cause, following a change in
    control of the Company (as defined).  In addition, for a
    certain period of time following employee termination, the
    Company, at its expense, must continue to provide on behalf
    of the terminated employee certain employment benefits.  In
    general, during the twelve months following a change in
    control, the Company may not terminate or change existing
    employee benefit plans in any way which will affect accrued
    benefits or decrease the rate of the Company's contribution
    to the plans.


    NOTE 18-ISSUANCE OF SERIES C PERCS AND TENDER OFFER

         In February 1992, the Company issued 15,000,000
    depositary shares of Series C Conversion Preferred Stock
    ("Series C PERCS") at $29.50 per depositary share (equivalent
    to $2,950.00 for each Series C PERCS).  Each of the
    depositary shares represents ownership of 1/100th of a share
    of Series C PERCS.  The annual dividend for each depositary
    share is $2.14 (based on the annual dividend rate for each
    Series C PERCS of $214.00).  On April 15, 1995, each of the
    depositary shares will automatically convert into (i) one
    share of Tandy common stock (equivalent to 100 shares for
    each Series C PERCS) subject to adjustment in certain events
    and (ii) the right to receive on such date an amount in cash
    equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. 
    Conversion of the outstanding depositary shares (and the
    Series C PERCS) is also required upon certain mergers or
    consolidations of the Company or in connection with certain
    other events.  The Company has reserved 15,000,000 shares of
    its common stock for the potential conversion of the Series C
    PERCS.  At any time and from time to time prior to the
    mandatory conversion date, the Company may call the
    outstanding Series C PERCS (and thereby the depositary
    shares), in whole or in part, for redemption.  Upon any such
    redemption, each owner of depositary shares will receive, in
    exchange for each depositary share so called, shares of Tandy
    common stock having a market value initially equal to $43.87
    (equivalent to $4,387.00 for each Series C PERCS), declining
    by $.004085 (equivalent to $.408500 for each Series C PERCS)
    on each day following the date of issue of the Series C PERCS
    to $39.50 (equivalent to $3,950.00 for each Series C PERCS)
    on February 15, 1995, and equal to $39.25 (equivalent to
    $3,925.00 for each Series C PERCS) thereafter, plus an amount
    in cash equal to all proportionate accrued and unpaid
    dividends thereon.  The liquidation preference for each
    depositary share is $29.50 (equivalent to $2,950 for each
    Series C PERCS) plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.  The
    holders of the Series C PERCS have the right, voting together
    with the common stockholders as one class, to vote in the
    election of directors and upon such other matters coming
    before any meeting of the stockholders and are entitled to
    cast 100 common stock votes for each Series C PERCS (or one
    common stock vote for each depositary share).

         Using a substantial portion of the proceeds from the
    issuance of the Series C PERCS, the Company purchased
    13,500,000 shares of its common stock at $32.00 per share in
    a "Dutch Auction" self tender offer that expired on March 26,
    1992.

         During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1991, the Company
    incurred non-cash financing activities which included the
    guarantee of TESOP indebtedness and increase in unearned
    deferred compensation of $100,000,000 and treasury stock
    issued under an earn-out program of $13,807,000.

    NOTE 20-LITIGATION

         In July 1985, Pan American Electronics, Inc., a Radio
    Shack dealer in Mission, Texas ("Pan Am"), filed suit against
    the Company in the 92nd Judicial District Court in Hidalgo
    County, Texas.  The Plaintiff's complaint alleged breach of
    contract and fraud based upon the allegations that the
    Company made certain misrepresentations and acted beyond the
    scope of its authority under the dealer agreement, with the
    alleged result that the plaintiff was forced out of the
    computer mail order business in 1984.  In November 1993, Pan
    Am and Tandy resolved the pending litigation and the lawsuit
    was dismissed in December 1993.  Although the terms of the
    settlement are confidential, the resolution of this legal
    action did not have a materially adverse impact on the
    Company's financial position or results of operation.

         There are various other claims, lawsuits, disputes with
    third parties, investigations and pending actions involving
    allegations of negligence, product defects, discrimination,
    patent infringement, tax deficiencies and breach of contract
    against the Company and its subsidiaries incident to the
    operation of its business.  The liability, if any, associated
    with these matters was not determinable at December 31, 1993.
    While certain of these matters involve substantial amounts,
    and although occasional adverse settlements or resolutions
    may occur and negatively impact earnings in the year of
    settlement, it is the opinion of management that their
    ultimate resolution will not have a materially adverse effect
    on Tandy's financial position.


    NOTE 21-RELATIONS WITH INTERTAN
         InterTAN Inc. ("InterTAN"), the former foreign retail
    operations of Tandy, was spun off to Tandy stockholders as a
    tax-free dividend in fiscal 1987.  Under the merchandise
    purchase terms of the original distribution agreement,
    InterTAN could purchase on payment terms from Tandy, at
    negotiated prices, new and replacement models of products
    that Tandy had in its Radio Shack U.S. catalog or which Tandy
    may reasonably secure.  A&A International ("A&A"), a
    subsidiary of Tandy, was the exclusive purchasing agent for
    products originating in the Far East for InterTAN.

         On July 16, 1993 InterTAN had an account payable to
    Tandy of approximately $17,000,000 of which $7,600,000 was in
    default.  InterTAN's outstanding purchase orders for
    merchandise placed under the distribution agreement with
    Tandy, but not yet shipped, totaled approximately
    $44,000,000.  Because InterTAN had defaulted, on July 16
    Tandy terminated the merchandise purchase terms of the
    distribution agreement and the license agreements.  Tandy
    offered InterTAN interim license agreements which expired
    July 22, 1993, unless extended.  These were extended on July
    23, 1993.

         On July 30, 1993 Trans World Electronics, Inc. ("Trans
    World"), a subsidiary of Tandy, reached agreement with
    InterTAN's banking syndicate to buy approximately $42,000,000
    of InterTAN's debt at a negotiated, discounted price.  The
    closing of this purchase occurred on August 5, 1993, at which
    time Tandy resumed limited shipments to InterTAN and granted
    a series of short-term, interim licenses pending the
    execution of new license and merchandise agreements.  The
    debt purchased from the banks has been restructured into a
    seven-year note with interest of 8.64% due semiannually
    beginning February 25, 1994 and semiannual principal payments
    beginning February 25, 1995 (the "Series A" note).  Trans
    World has provided approximately $10,000,000 in working
    capital and trade credit to InterTAN.  Interest on the
    working capital loan (the "Series B" note) of 8.11% is due
    semiannually beginning February 25, 1994 with the principal
    due in full on August 25, 1996.  Trans World also has
    received warrants with a five-year term exercisable for
    approximately 1,450,000 shares of InterTAN common stock at an
    exercise price of $6.62 per share.  As required by an
    agreement with Trans World, InterTAN filed a registration
    statement on January 21, 1994 seeking to register the
    warrants under the Securities Act of 1933.

         In addition to the bank debt purchased by Trans World
    and the working capital loan, InterTAN's obligations to Trans
    World included two additional notes for approximately
    $23,665,000 (the "Series C" note) and $24,037,000, (the
    "Series D" note) with interest rates of 7.5% and 8%,
    respectively.  The notes represent the restructuring of
    InterTAN accounts payable for merchandise already shipped and
    require monthly interest payments.  Also, InterTAN had
    obligations for purchase orders outstanding for merchandise
    ordered by A&A for InterTAN but not yet shipped totaling
    approximately $31,262,000 at December 31, 1993.  All
    principal and interest on the Series C note was paid in full
    by December 31, 1993.  As merchandise under existing
    outstanding purchase orders is shipped, A&A will invoice
    InterTAN and amounts owed will be assigned to Trans World and
    will increase the amount of the Series D note.  The balance
    of the Series D note as of December 31, 1993 was
    approximately $7,500,000.  All of Tandy's debt from InterTAN
    is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of
    InterTAN's assets.

         A new merchandise agreement was reached with InterTAN in
    October 1993 which requires future purchase orders be backed
    by letters of credit posted by InterTAN.  New license
    agreements have been negotiated which provide for a future
    royalty to Tandy.

         As required by the various agreements now existing
    between Tandy and InterTAN, InterTAN has obtained a bank
    revolving credit facility for Canadian $30,000,000 (U.S.
    $22,662,000 equivalent at December 31, 1993).  Tandy has
    agreed with InterTAN's new banking agent,  that in case of
    InterTAN's default on the bank credit line, Tandy will, at
    the option of the bank, purchase InterTAN's inventory and
    related accounts receivable at 50% of their net book value,
    up to the amount of outstanding bank loans, but not to exceed
    Canadian $60,000,000 (U.S. $45,324,000 equivalent at December
    31, 1993).  In that event, Tandy could foreclose on its first
    priority lien on InterTAN's assets.  If Tandy fails to
    purchase the inventory and related accounts receivable of
    InterTAN from the bank, InterTAN's banking agent, upon notice
    to Tandy and expiration of time, can foreclose upon
    InterTAN's assets ahead of Tandy.

         As of December 31,1993 InterTAN owed Tandy an aggregate
    of $63,511,000.  The current portion of the obligation
    approximates $11,650,000 and the non-current portion
    approximates $51,861,000.  In 1993 Tandy has not recognized
    any accretion of discount on the note receivable from
    InterTAN resulting from the purchase of the bank debt at a
    discounted price but will commence accretion of such discount
    in 1994 due to InterTAN's financial results and payment
    history as of December 31, 1993.  Accretion of this discount
    will be based on the effective interest rate method and will
    approximate $3,856,000 in 1994.  During the year ended
    December 31, 1993, Tandy recognized approximately $93,315,000
    of sales to InterTAN and interest income of $3,085,000.
    Tandy's sales to InterTAN totaled $90,130,000 during the six
    months ended December 31, 1992, $171,126,000 during fiscal
    1992, and $160,024,000 during fiscal 1991.

         A&A will continue as the exclusive purchasing agent for
    InterTAN in the Far East on a commission basis.  Commencing
    in March 1994 only the purchasing agent commission and sales
    by Tandy manufacturing plants to InterTAN will be recorded as
    sales.  InterTAN purchases from third parties through A&A
    will no longer be recorded as sales reflecting the
    arrangement under the new merchandise agreement. 
    Accordingly, management expects that reported sales by Tandy
    to InterTAN in 1994 will be considerably lower than in prior
    years, however, the earned income relating thereto will not
    be materially different.


    NOTE 22-QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)

         As the Company's operations are predominantly retail
    oriented, its business is subject to seasonal fluctuations
    with the December 31 quarter being the most significant in
    terms of sales and profits because of the Christmas selling
    season.

         During the quarter ended December 31, 1993, the Company
    recognized a gain, net of tax, from discontinued operations
    of approximately $15,822,000.  This gain partially offsets
    the after-tax charge of $70,000,000 previously taken in the
    June 1993 quarter and reduces the loss on disposal of
    discontinued operations to approximately $54,178,000.  The
    gain resulted from the better than anticipated sales price
    received for O'Sullivan partially offset by additional
    foreign currency translation losses and below plan operating
    results of the divested companies during the divestment
    period, net of related income tax adjustments.  See Note 3
    for further information on discontinued operations.

         During the quarter ended March 31, 1993, the Company
    adopted FAS 109 which changes the Company's method of
    accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to an
    asset and liability approach.  The adjustments to the January
    1, 1993 balance sheet to adopt FAS 109 totaled $13,014,000.
    This amount is reflected in 1993 net income as the cumulative
    effect of a change in accounting principle.  See Note 2 for
    further information on Change in Accounting Principle -
    Provision for Income Taxes.

         During the quarter ended December 31, 1992, the Company
    provided pre-tax reserves of $48,000,000 and $39,500,000 for
    business restructuring relating to continuing and
    discontinued operations, respectively.  See Note 4 for
    further information on restructuring and other charges.

         During the quarter ended June 30, 1992, the Company
    completed the sale of a Japanese subsidiary, the assets of
    which were primarily real estate.  The pre-tax gain from this
    sale, including recognition of foreign currency translation
    adjustments, was $18,987,000.

         As discussed in detail in Note 2, income per share
    amounts and the weighted average of common and common
    equivalent shares outstanding for all quarters commencing
    with the quarter ending March 31, 1992 (date of issuance)
    through September 30, 1993 have been retroactively restated
    for the assumption that the PERCS will convert into
    12,457,133 shares in lieu of the previously used 15,000,000
    common shares based upon the Company's stock price at
    December 31, 1993.

    Dear Sirs:

              O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
    corporation (the "Company"), and TE Electronics Inc., a
    Delaware corporation (the "Selling Stockholder"), confirm
    their agreement with you and each of the other underwriters
    named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "U.S.
    Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter
    substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 10 hereof),
    for whom Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
    ("Merrill Lynch"), Wheat, First Securities, Inc., The Chicago
    Dearborn Company and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc. are acting
    as U.S. representatives (in such capacity, Merrill Lynch,
    Wheat, First Securities, Inc., The Chicago Dearborn Company
    and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc. being hereinafter
    collectively referred to as the "U.S. Representatives"), with
    respect to (i) the sale by the Selling Stockholder and the
    purchase by the U.S. Underwriters, acting severally and not
    jointly, of the respective number of shares of Common Stock,
    par value $1.00 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Company
    set forth in Schedule A hereto, together with the Preferred
    Stock Purchase Rights of the Company (the "Rights")
    associated with such shares, and (ii) the grant by the
    Company to the U.S. Underwriters, acting severally and not
    jointly, of the option described in Section 2(b) hereof to
    purchase all or any part of the U.S. Underwriters' pro rata
    portion of up to an additional 1,800,000 shares of Common
    Stock, together with the Rights associated with such shares,
    to cover over-allotments, in each case except as may
    otherwise be provided in the U.S. Pricing Agreement (as
    hereinafter defined).  The 11,764,000 shares of Common Stock,
    together with the Rights associated with such shares, to be
    purchased by the U.S. Underwriters from the Selling
    Stockholder (the "Initial U.S. Securities") and all or any
    part of the U.S. Underwriters' pro rata portion of the
    1,800,000 shares of Common Stock, together with the Rights
    associated with such shares, subject to the option described
    in Section 2(b) hereof (the "U.S. Option Securities") are
    hereinafter collectively referred to as the "U.S.
    Securities."

              It is understood that the Company and the Selling
    Stockholder are concurrently entering into an International
    Purchase Agreement of even date herewith (the "International
    Purchase Agreement") with respect to (i) the sale by the
    Selling Stockholder of 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock,
    together with the Rights associated with such shares (the
    "Initial International Securities"), through arrangements
    with certain managing underwriters outside the United States
    and Canada (the "Managers"), for whom Merrill Lynch
    International Limited and UBS Limited are acting as lead
    managers (the "Lead Managers"), and (ii) the grant by the
    Company to the Managers of an option to purchase all or any
    part of the Managers' pro rata portion of up to an additional
    1,800,000 shares of Common Stock, together with the Rights
    associated with such shares (the "International Option
    Securities"), to cover over-allotments, in each case except
    as may otherwise be provided in the International Pricing
    Agreement (as hereinafter defined).  The Initial
    International Securities and the International Option
    Securities are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    "International Securities."   It is understood that the U.S.
    Underwriters are not obligated to purchase any Initial U.S.
    Securities unless all of the Initial International Securities
    are contemporaneously purchased by the Managers.

              The U.S. Underwriters and the Managers are
    hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Underwriters." 
    The Initial U.S. Securities and the Initial International
    Securities are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    "Initial Securities."  The U.S. Option Securities and the
    International Option Securities are hereinafter collectively
    referred to as the "Option Securities."  The U.S. Securities
    and the International Securities are hereinafter collectively
    referred to as the "Securities."  Unless the context
    otherwise requires, all references contained herein to the
    Initial U.S. Securities, the U.S. Option Securities, the U.S.
    Securities, the Initial International Securities, the
    International Option Securities, the International
    Securities, the Initial Securities, the Option Securities and
    the Securities shall include the respective numbers of shares
    of Common Stock set forth above, together with the Rights
    associated with such shares.

              The Company and the Selling Stockholder understand
    that the Underwriters are concurrently entering into an
    Intersyndicate Agreement of even date herewith providing for
    the coordination of certain transactions among the
    Underwriters under the direction of the U.S. Representatives
    and Lead Managers.

              Prior to the purchase and public offering of the
    U.S. Securities by the several U.S. Underwriters, the
    Company, the Selling Stockholder and the U.S.
    Representatives, acting on behalf of the several U.S.
    Underwriters, shall enter into an agreement substantially in
    the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "U.S. Pricing Agreement"). 
    The U.S. Pricing Agreement may take the form of an exchange
    of any standard form of written telecommunication among the
    Company, the Selling Stockholder and the U.S. Representatives
    and shall specify such applicable information as is indicated
    in Exhibit A hereto. The offering of the U.S. Securities will
    be governed by this Agreement, as supplemented by the U.S.
    Pricing Agreement. From and after the date of the execution
    and delivery of the U.S. Pricing Agreement, this Agreement
    shall be deemed to incorporate, and all references to "this
    Agreement" or "herein" shall be deemed to include, the U.S.
    Pricing Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise. 
    The initial public offering price and the purchase price with
    respect to the International Securities shall be set forth in
    a separate instrument (the "International Pricing
    Agreement"), the form of which is attached to the
    International Purchase Agreement.  The price per share for
    the International Securities to be purchased by the Managers
    pursuant to the International Purchase Agreement shall be
    identical to the price per share for the U.S. Securities to
    be purchased by the U.S. Underwriters hereunder.

          The Company has filed with the United States
    Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a
    registration statement on Form S-1 (Commission File No.
    33-72120) to effect the registration of the Securities under
    the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), has
    filed such amendments thereto, if any, as may have been
    required to the date hereof, and will file such additional
    amendments thereto as may hereafter be required.  Such
    registration statement includes two forms of prospectus for
    use in connection with the offering and sale of the
    Securities: the U.S. prospectus, for use in connection with
    the offering and sale of Securities in the United States and
    Canada to United States and Canadian persons and the
    international prospectus, for use in connection with the
    offering and sale of Securities outside the United States and
    Canada to persons other than United States and Canadian
    persons.  The U.S. prospectus and international prospectus
    are identical except that they contain different outside
    front and outside back cover pages and different sections
    under the caption "Underwriting" and the international
    prospectus contains an additional section under the caption
    "Certain United States Tax Consequences to Non-United States
    Holders."  Such registration statement also includes a third
    form of prospectus relating to a separate offering of 236,000
    shares of Common Stock, together with the Rights associated
    with such shares, to certain members of the Company's
    management and their affiliates.  Such registration statement
    (as amended, if applicable) and the prospectuses constituting
    a part thereof at the time such registration statement
    becomes effective (including, in each case, the information,
    if any, deemed to be part thereof pursuant to Rule 430A(b) of
    the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933
    Act (the "1933 Act Regulations")), as from time to time
    amended or supplemented pursuant to the 1933 Act or
    otherwise, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration
    Statement."  The U.S. prospectus and the international
    prospectus in the respective forms included in the
    Registration Statement are hereinafter referred to as the
    "U.S. Prospectus" and the "International Prospectus," except
    that if any revised prospectuses shall be provided to the
    U.S. Underwriters or the Managers by the Company for use in
    connection with the offering of the Securities which differ
    from the prospectuses on file at the Commission at the time
    the Registration Statement becomes effective (whether or not
    such revised prospectuses are required to be filed by the
    Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations),
    the terms "U.S. Prospectus" and "International Prospectus"
    shall refer to such revised prospectuses from and after the
    time they are first provided to the U.S. Underwriters or the
    Managers for such use.  The U.S. Prospectus and the
    International Prospectus are hereinafter referred to
    collectively as the "Prospectuses" and, each individually, as
    a "Prospectus."  The prospectus relating to the separate
    offering of 236,000 shares of Common Stock and associated
    Rights to certain members of the Company's management and
    their affiliates in the form included in the Registration
    Statement is hereinafter referred to as the "Management
    Prospectus."

              The Company and the Selling Stockholder understand
    that the U.S. Underwriters propose to make a public offering
    of the U.S. Securities as soon as the U.S. Representatives
    deem advisable after the Registration Statement becomes
    effective and the U.S. Pricing Agreement has been executed
    and delivered.

              SECTION 1.  Representations and Warranties.

                   (a)  The Company and the Selling Stockholder
              jointly and severally represent and warrant to each
              of the U.S. Underwriters (except that the Selling
              Stockholder does not make any representation or
              warranty with respect to the matters addressed by
              clauses (xii), (xvi), (xvii), (xviii) and (xxi)
              below) as of the date hereof and as of the date of
              the U.S. Pricing Agreement (such latter date being
              hereinafter referred to as the "U.S. Representation
              Date") as follows:

                   (i)  At the time the Registration Statement
              becomes effective and at the U.S. Representation
              Date, the Registration Statement will comply in all
              material respects with the requirements of the 1933
              Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and will not
              contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
              omit to state a material fact required to be stated
              therein or necessary to make the statements therein
              not misleading.  The Prospectuses, at the U.S.
              Representation Date (unless the term "Prospectuses"
              refers to prospectuses which have been provided to
              the U.S. Underwriters and the Managers by the
              Company for use in connection with the offering of
              the Securities which differ from the prospectuses
              on file at the Commission at the time the
              Registration Statement becomes effective, in which
              case at the time such prospectuses are first
              provided to the U.S. Underwriters and the Managers
              for such use) and at Closing Time (as hereinafter
              defined) will not include an untrue statement of a
              material fact or omit to state a material fact
              necessary in order to make the statements therein,
              in the light of the circumstances under which they
              were made, not misleading; provided, however, that
              the representations and warranties in this
              subsection shall not apply to statements in or
              omissions from the Registration Statement or
              Prospectuses made in reliance upon and in
              conformity with information furnished to the
              Company in writing by any Underwriter through
              Merrill Lynch expressly for use in the Registration
              Statement or the Prospectuses.

                   (ii)  Price Waterhouse, the accountants who
              reported on the combined financial statements
              included in the Registration Statement and the
              Prospectuses are independent public accountants
              with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
              (as hereinafter defined) as required by the 1933
              Act and the 1933 Act Regulations.

                   (iii)  The combined financial statements,
              including the notes thereto, included in the
              Registration Statement and the Prospectuses present
              fairly the combined financial position of the
              Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates
              indicated and the combined results of operations
              and cash flows for the Company and its Subsidiaries
              for the periods specified; such financial
              statements have been prepared in conformity
              with generally accepted accounting principles
              applied on a consistent basis throughout the
              periods involved; there are no supporting schedules
              required to be included in the Registration
              Statement pursuant to the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act
              Regulations (other than schedules which have been         
              ommitted therefrom because the required information
              is included in the combined financial statements,
              including the notes thereto, included in the
              Registration Statement and the Prospectuses).

                   (iv)  The pro forma financial information
              included in the Registration Statement and the
              Prospectuses has been prepared in all material
              respects in accordance with the applicable rules
              and regulations of the Commission with respect to
              pro forma financial statements, presents fairly the
              information included therein and has been properly
              compiled on the pro forma basis described therein;
              in the opinion of the Company and the Selling
              Stockholder, the assumptions used in the
              preparation of such pro forma financial information
              are reasonable and the adjustments made thereto are
              appropriate to give effect to the transactions and
              events referred to therein.

                   (v)  Since the respective dates as of which
              information is given in the Registration Statement
              and the Prospectuses, except as otherwise stated
              therein or expressly contemplated thereby, (A)
              there has been no material adverse change in the
              condition, financial or otherwise, or the earnings,
              business affairs or business prospects of the
              Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
              enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary
              course of business, (B) there have been no
              transactions entered into by the Company or any of
              its Subsidiaries, other than the reorganization
              transactions to be consummated prior to or at
              Closing Time as described in the Prospectuses under
              the caption "Certain Transactions --Reorganization
              Transactions" and other transactions entered into
              in the ordinary course of business, which are
              material with respect to the Company and its
              Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise and
              (C) except for (1) the dividend in the amount of
              $40 million to be paid to the Selling Stockholder
              by Old O'Sullivan (as hereinafter defined) prior to
              Closing Time as described in the Prospectuses under
              the caption "Certain Transactions -- Reorganization
              Transactions, (2) the final adjusting payment, if
              any, to be made by the Company to Tandy as a result
              of the accounting of the stockholders' equity of
              the Company at Closing Time described in the
              Prospectuses under the caption "Certain
              Transactions -- The Reorganization" and (3) the
              dividend of one Right to be issued with respect to
              each share of Common Stock as described in the
              Prospectuses under the caption "Description of
              Capital Stock -- Stockholder Rights Plan," there
              has been no dividend or distribution of any kind
              declared, paid or made by the Company or any of its
              Subsidiaries on any class of their capital stock.

                   (vi)  The Company has been duly incorporated
              and is validly existing as a corporation in good
              standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
              and has all necessary corporate power to own, lease
              and operate its properties and to conduct its
              business as described in the Prospectuses, and the
              Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation
              to transact business and is in good standing in
              each jurisdiction in which such qualification is
              required, whether by reason of the ownership or
              leasing of property or the conduct of business,
              except where the failure to have such corporate
              power or to be so qualified would not have a
              material adverse effect on the condition, financial
              or otherwise, or on the earnings, business affairs
              or business prospects of the Company and its

              business, except where the failure to have such
              corporate power or to be so qualified would not
              have a material adverse effect on the condition,
              financial or otherwise, or on the earnings,

              respect the transactions contemplated by this
              Agreement or the International Purchase Agreement
              and would not have a material adverse effect on the

              otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or
              business prospects of the Company and its
              Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise or to

              materially and adversely affect the consummation of
              the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
              the International Purchase Agreement; all pending
              legal or governmental proceedings to which the

              income and franchise tax returns required to be
              filed through the date hereof, except insofar as
              the failure to file any such returns would not have
              a material adverse effect on the condition,
              financial or otherwise, or on the earnings,
              business affairs or business prospects of the

              tax deficiency asserted against the Company or any
              of its Subsidiaries which, if determined adversely
              to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would
              have a material adverse effect on the condition,
              financial or otherwise, or on the earnings,
              business affairs or business prospects of the
              Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
              enterprise.

              materially impair or interfere with the use
              currently made by the Company or its Subsidiaries
              of the properties or assets to which it applies or

              information, systems or procedures),
              trademarks, service marks and trade names
              (collectively, "patent and proprietary rights")
              necessary to conduct the business now conducted by
              them, and neither the Company nor any of its
              Subsidiaries has received any notice or is
              otherwise aware of any infringement of or
              conflict with asserted rights of others with
              respect to any patent and proprietary rights,
              except where such infringement or conflict, if the
              subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or
              finding, would not result in a material adverse
              change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or
              the earnings, business affairs or business
              prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries

              described in the Prospectuses, except as disclosed
              in the Prospectuses and except where the failure to
              possess such licenses, permits, consents, orders,
              certificates or authorizations would not have a
              material adverse effect on the condition, financial
              or otherwise, or on the earnings, business affairs
              or business prospects of the Company and its
              Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise; and

              revocation or modification of any such licenses,
              permits, consents, orders, certificates or
              authorizations which, if the subject of an
              unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would have
              a material adverse effect on the condition,
              financial or otherwise, or on the earnings,
              business affairs or business prospects of the

              any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
              properties and assets are subject, except where
              such violation would not have a material adverse
              effect on the condition, financial or otherwise, or
              on the earnings, business affairs or business
              prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries
              considered as one enterprise; without limiting the
              generality of the foregoing, neither the Company

              employees or any applicable federal or state wages
              and hours laws, or (D) any provisions of the
              Employee Retirement Income Security Act or the
              rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
              except as disclosed in the Prospectus and except
              for any such violations which would not have a
              material adverse effect on the condition, financial
              or otherwise, or the earnings, business affairs or
              business prospects of the Company and its
              Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

                   (xx)  The Company has reasonably concluded
              that, except as disclosed in the Prospectus, the
              costs and liabilities associated with compliance

              material adverse effect on the condition, financial
              or otherwise, or the earnings, business affairs or
              business prospects of the Company and its
              Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

                   (xxi)  The Company and its Subsidiaries

              specific authorization, (B) transactions are
              recorded in all material respects as necessary to
              permit preparation of their financial statements
              and to maintain accountability for their assets and
              (C) access to assets that are material to the
              Company or its Subsidiaries is permitted only in
              accordance with management's general or specific
              authorization.

              Subsidiaries of the Reorganization Agreements to
              which each of them is a party or is proposed to be
              a party and the consummation by the Company and
              each of its Subsidiaries of the transactions
              contemplated therein will not conflict with or
              constitute a breach or violation of, or default
              under, or result in the creation or imposition of
              any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property
              or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
              pursuant to, any contract, indenture, mortgage,
              loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or
              instrument to which the Company or any of its
              Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of
              them is bound, or to which any of the property or
              assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
              subject, nor will such action result in any breach
              or violation of, or default under, the provisions
              of the charter or bylaws of the Company or any of
              its Subsidiaries or of any existing applicable
              law, administrative regulation or administrative or
              court decree, in each case, except as disclosed in
              the Prospectuses and except for such conflicts,
              breaches, violations, defaults, liens, charges or
              encumbrances that would not have a material adverse
              effect on the condition, financial or otherwise, or
              on the earnings, business affairs or business
              prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries
              considered as one enterprise.

                   (xxiv)  Neither the Company nor any of its
              Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a
              company "controlled" by an "investment company"
              within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
              1940, as amended.

                   (xxv)  The Company and its Subsidiaries have
              complied with all provisions of Section 517.075,
              Florida Statutes (Chapter 92-198, Laws of Florida)
              relating to doing business with the Government of
              Cuba or any person or affiliate located in Cuba.

              (b)  The Selling Stockholder further represents and
    warrants to each of the U.S. Underwriters as of the date
    hereof and as of the U.S. Representation Date as follows:

                   (i)  At Closing Time, the Selling Stockholder
              will be the sole record and beneficial owner of the
              Initial Securities, and will have valid and
              marketable title to the Initial Securities, free
              and clear of any claim, lien, security interest,
              encumbrance, restriction on transfer or other
              defect in title; upon delivery of and payment for
              the Initial Securities pursuant to this Agreement
              and the International Purchase Agreement, the
              Underwriters will acquire valid and marketable

              any claim, lien, security interest, encumbrance,
              restriction on transfer or other defect in title.

                   (ii)  This Agreement has been duly authorized,
              executed and delivered by the Selling Stockholder
              and, at the U.S. Representation Date, the U.S.
              Pricing Agreement will be duly authorized, executed
              and delivered by the Selling Stockholder.

                   (iii)  The execution, delivery and performance
              of this Agreement, the International Purchase
              Agreement, the U.S. Pricing Agreement and the
              International Pricing Agreement by the Selling
              Stockholder and the consummation by the Selling
              Stockholder of the transactions contemplated herein
              and therein will not conflict with or constitute a
              breach or violation of, or a default under, or
              result in the creation or imposition of any lien,
              charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets
              of the Selling Stockholder pursuant to, any
              contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement,
              note, lease or other agreement or instrument to
              which the Selling Stockholder is a party or by

              or assets of the Selling Stockholder is subject,
              nor will such action result in any breach or
              violation of, or default under, the provisions of
              the charter or bylaws of the Selling Stockholder or
              of any existing applicable law, administrative
              regulation or administrative or court decree.

                   (iv)  No authorization, approval or consent
              of, or registration or filing with, any court or
              governmental authority or agency is required for
              the execution, delivery or performance by the
              Selling Stockholder of this Agreement, the
              International Purchase Agreement, the U.S. Pricing
              Agreement or the International Pricing Agreement or
              the consummation by the Selling Stockholder of the
              transactions contemplated herein and therein,
              except such as may be required under the 1933 Act,
              the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act or the 1934
              Act Regulations or under the securities laws of any
              state or other jurisdiction.

                   (v)  At Closing Time, each of the
              Reorganization Agreements to which the Selling
              Stockholder is proposed to be a party will be duly
              authorized, executed and delivered by the Selling
              Stockholder; at Closing Time, each of the
              Reorganization Agreements to which the Selling
              Stockholder is proposed to be a party will
              constitute a valid and binding obligation of the
              Selling Stockholder, enforceable against the
              Selling Stockholder in accordance with its terms
              (except to the extent that the enforceability
              thereof is subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy,
              insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
              similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally
              and (ii) general principles of equity, whether such
              principles are considered in a proceeding at law or
              in equity).

                   (vi)  The execution, delivery and performance
              by the Selling Stockholder of the Reorganization
              Agreements to which the Selling Stockholder is or
              is proposed to be a party and the consummation by
              the Selling Stockholder of the transactions
              contemplated therein will not conflict with or
              constitute a breach or violation of, or a default
              under, or result in the creation or imposition of
              any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property
              or assets of the Selling Stockholder pursuant to,
              any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement,
              note, lease or other agreement or instrument to
              which the Selling Stockholder is a party or by
              which it is bound, or to which any of the property
              or assets of the Selling Stockholder is subject,
              nor will such action result in any breach or
              violation of, or default under, the provisions of
              the charter or bylaws of the Selling Stockholder or
              of any existing applicable law, administrative
              regulation or administrative or court decree, in
              each case, except as disclosed in the Prospectuses
              and except for such conflicts, breaches,
              violations, defaults, liens, charges or
              encumbrances that would not affect in any material
              respect the transactions contemplated by this
              Agreement or the International Purchase Agreement
              and would not have a material adverse effect on the
              condition, financial or otherwise, or on the
              earnings, business affairs or business prospects of
              the Selling Stockholder and its subsidiaries
              considered as one enterprise.

              (c) Any certificate signed by any officer of the
    Company delivered to the U.S. Representatives or to counsel
    for the U.S. Underwriters under or in connection with this
    Agreement or at Closing Time or any Date of Delivery (as
    hereinafter defined) shall be deemed a representation and
    warranty by the Company to each U.S. Underwriter as to the
    matters covered thereby; and any certificate signed by any
    officer of the Selling Stockholder and delivered to the U.S.
    Representatives or to counsel for the U.S. Underwriters under
    or in connection with this Agreement or at Closing Time or
    any Date of Delivery shall be deemed a representation and
    warranty by the Selling Stockholder to each U.S. Underwriter
    as to the matters covered thereby.

              SECTION 2.  Sale and Delivery to U.S. Underwriters;
    Reorganization Transactions; Closing.

              (a)  On the basis of the representations and
    warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and
    conditions herein set forth, the Selling Stockholder agrees
    to sell to each U.S. Underwriter, severally and not jointly,
    and each U.S. Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees
    to purchase from the Selling Stockholder, at the price per
    share set forth in the U.S. Pricing Agreement, the number of
    Initial U.S. Securities set forth in Schedule A opposite the
    name of such U.S. Underwriter (except as otherwise provided
    in the U.S. Pricing Agreement), plus any additional number of
    Initial U.S. Securities which such U.S. Underwriter may
    become obligated to purchase pursuant to the provisions of
    Section 10 hereof, subject, in each case, to such adjustments
    as the U.S. Representatives in their discretion shall make to
    eliminate any sales or purchases of fractional securities.

                   (i)  If the Company has elected not to rely
              upon Rule 430A of the 1933 Act Regulations, the
              initial public offering price of the Securities and
              the purchase price per share to be paid by the
              several U.S. Underwriters for the U.S. Securities
              have each been determined and set forth in the U.S.
              Pricing Agreement, dated the date hereof, and an
              amendment to the Registration Statement and the
              Prospectuses will be filed before the Registration
              Statement becomes effective.

                   (ii)  If the Company has elected to rely upon
              Rule 430A of the 1933 Act Regulations, the purchase
              price per share to be paid by the several U.S.
              Underwriters for the U.S. Securities shall be an
              amount equal to the initial public offering price,
              less an amount per share to be determined by
              agreement among the Company, the Selling
              Stockholder and the U.S. Representatives.  The
              initial public offering price per share of the
              Securities shall be a fixed price to be determined
              by agreement among the Company, the Selling
              Stockholder and the U.S. Representatives and the
              Selling Stockholder.  The initial public offering
              price per share and the purchase price, when so
              determined, shall be set forth in the U.S. Pricing
              Agreement.  In the event that such prices have not
              been agreed upon and the U.S. Pricing Agreement has
              not been executed and delivered by the parties
              thereto by the close of business on the fourth
              business day following the date of this Agreement,
              this Agreement shall terminate forthwith, without
              liability of any party to any other party, unless
              otherwise agreed to by the Company, the Selling
              Stockholder and the U.S. Representatives.
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of
              Sections 4(a), 6 and 7 hereof shall remain in
              effect following any such termination.

              (b)  In addition, on the basis of the
    representations and warranties herein contained and subject
    to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company
    hereby grants an option to the Underwriters, severally and
    not jointly, to purchase from the Company an aggregate of up
    to an additional 1,800,000 shares of Common Stock, together
    with the Rights associated with such shares, at the price per
    share set forth in the U.S. Pricing Agreement and the
    International Pricing Agreement, of which 1,440,000 shares
    and associated Rights shall be the pro rata portion for the
    U.S. Underwriters and 360,000 shares and associated Rights
    shall be the pro rata portion for the Managers.  The option
    hereby granted will expire on the 30th day after the date the
    Registration Statement becomes effective or, if the Company
    has elected to rely on Rule 430A of the 1933 Act Regulations,
    the 30th day after the U.S. Representation Date, and may be
    exercised in whole or in part from time to time only for the
    purpose of covering over-allotments which may be made in
    connection with the offering and distribution of the Initial
    Securities upon notice by the U.S. Representatives and the
    Lead Managers to the Company setting forth the aggregate
    number of Option Securities as to which the several
    Underwriters are then exercising said option and the time and
    date of payment and delivery for such Option Securities.  Any
    such time and date of delivery for the U.S. Option Securities
    (a "Date of Delivery") shall be determined by the U.S.
    Representatives but shall be not earlier than two nor later
    than seven full business days after the exercise of said
    option, nor in any event prior to Closing Time, unless
    otherwise agreed upon by the U.S. Representatives and the
    Company.  If the option is exercised as to all or any portion
    of the U.S. Option Securities, each of the U.S. Underwriters,
    acting severally and not jointly, will purchase from the
    Company that proportion of the number of U.S. Option
    Securities then being purchased which the number of Initial
    U.S. Securities set forth in Schedule A opposite the name of
    such U.S. Underwriter (plus any additional number of Initial
    U.S. Securities which such U.S. Underwriter may become
    obligated to purchase pursuant to the provisions of Section
    10 hereof) bears to the total number of Initial U.S.
    Securities (except as otherwise provided in the U.S. Pricing
    Agreement), subject, in each case, to such adjustments as the
    U.S. Representatives in their discretion shall make to
    eliminate any sales or purchases of fractional securities. 
    For purposes of this Agreement, the term "business day" means
    a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for
    trading.

              (c)  The Selling Stockholder and the Company agree
    with the several Underwriters that, immediately prior to
    Closing Time, (i) the Selling Stockholder will transfer to
    the Company, in exchange for the issuance by the Company of
    14,999,900 shares of Common Stock, together with the Rights
    associated with such shares (the receipt of which shares and
    associated Rights shall be subject to the obligations of the
    Selling Stockholder to sell the Initial Securities to the
    Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement and the International
    Purchase Agreement), all the issued and outstanding shares of
    capital stock of O'Sullivan Industries, Inc., a Delaware
    corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Selling
    Stockholder ("Old O'Sullivan"), and (ii) the Company will
    accept such transfer and will issue such shares of Common
    Stock and associated Rights to the Selling Stockholder.  The
    foregoing transactions will be effected in accordance with a
    Stock Exchange Agreement (the "Stock Exchange Agreement") to
    be entered into between the Selling Stockholder and the
    Company after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
    but prior to Closing Time.  In addition, (i) Tandy Marketing
    (Canada) Ltd., an Alberta corporation ("Tandy Marketing
    Canada"), has transferred to Old O'Sullivan certain assets
    located in Canada that are used in connection with the
    business conducted by Old O'Sullivan, (ii) Tandy Corporation,
    the Selling Stockholder and the Company will enter into a
    Cross Indemnification Agreement (the "Cross Indemnification
    Agreement") prior to Closing Time pursuant to which the
    parties will agree to indemnify each other for certain claims
    and liabilities as specified therein, (iii) Tandy
    Corporation, the Selling Stockholder and the Company will
    enter in to a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement
    Agreement (the "Tax Agreement") prior to Closing Time
    pursuant to which (A) the parties will agree upon the
    allocation of certain federal, state and local taxes of Old
    O'Sullivan (including any adjustments to such taxes), (B) Old
    O'Sullivan and Tandy Corporation will agree to make elections
    under Sections 338(g) and 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, and (C) Old O'Sullivan will agree
    to pay to the Selling Stockholder, as additional purchase
    price under the Stock Exchange Agreement, amounts
    approximately equal to certain federal tax benefits related
    to the increase in the tax basis of Old O'Sullivan's assets
    resulting from the consummation of the transactions
    contemplated by the Stock Exchange Agreement and the Sections
    338(g) and 338(h)(10) elections.  The Stock Exchange
    Agreement, Cross Indemnification Agreement and Tax Agreement
    will be substantially in the respective forms filed as
    exhibits to the Registration Statement.  The Stock Exchange
    Agreement, Cross Indemnification Agreement and Tax Agreement
    are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    "Reorganization Agreements."  Old O'Sullivan and each other
    direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company as of the
    Closing Time are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    "Subsidiaries."

              (d)  Payment of the purchase price for, and
    delivery of certificates evidencing the Initial U.S. 
    Securities to be purchased by the U.S.  Underwriters shall be
    made at the office of Baker & Botts, L.L.P., 2001 Ross
    Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75201, or at such other place as shall
    be agreed upon by the U.S. Representatives, the Company and
    the Selling Stockholder, at 9:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on
    the fifth business day (unless postponed in accordance with
    the provisions of Section 10 hereof) following the date of
    the execution of the U.S. Pricing Agreement or such other
    time not later than ten business days after such date as
    shall be agreed upon by the U.S. Representatives, the Company
    and the Selling Stockholder (such time and date of payment
    and delivery being hereinafter referred to as "Closing
    Time"). In addition, in the event that any or all of the U.S.
    Option Securities are purchased by the U.S. Underwriters,
    payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of
    certificates for, such U.S. Option Securities shall be made
    at the above-mentioned office of Baker & Botts, L.L.P., or at
    such other place as shall be mutually agreed upon by the U.S.
    Representatives and the Company, on each Date of Delivery as
    specified in the notice from the U.S. Representatives to the
    Company.  Payment shall be made to the Selling Stockholder,
    with respect to the Initial U.S. Securities, and to the
    Company, with respect to any U.S. Option Securities, by
    certified or official bank check or checks drawn in New York
    Clearing House funds or similar next-day funds payable to the
    order of the Selling Stockholder or the Company, as the case
    may be, against delivery to the U.S. Representatives for the
    respective accounts of the U.S. Underwriters of certificates
    for the U.S. Securities to be purchased by them. 
    Certificates evidencing the Initial U.S. Securities and the
    U.S. Option Securities, if any, shall be in such
    denominations and registered in such names as the U.S.
    Representatives may request in writing at least two business
    days before Closing Time or the Date of Delivery, as the case
    may be.  It is understood that each U.S. Underwriter has
    authorized the U.S. Representatives, for its account, to
    accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the
    purchase price for, the U.S. Securities which it has agreed
    to purchase.  The U.S. Representatives, individually and not
    as representatives of the U.S. Underwriters, may (but shall
    not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for
    the U.S. Securities to be purchased by any U.S. Underwriter
    whose check has not been received by Closing Time or the Date
    of Delivery, as the case may be, but such payment shall not
    relieve such U.S. Underwriter from its obligations hereunder.
    The certificates evidencing the Initial U.S. Securities and
    the U.S. Option Securities to be purchased by the U.S.
    Underwriters will be made available in New York City for
    examination and packaging by the U.S. Representatives not
    later than 10:00 a.m. on the last business day prior to
    Closing Time or the Date of Delivery, as the case may be.

              SECTION 3.  Certain Covenants of the Company.  The
    Company covenants with each of the U.S. Underwriters asfollows:

              (a)  If the Company has elected not to rely upon
    Rule 430A of the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will
    promptly prepare and file with the Commission an amendment to
    the Registration Statement that sets forth the information
    specified in Section 2(a)(i) hereof and will make every
    reasonable effort to cause the Registration Statement to
    become effective as promptly as practicable.  If the Company
    has elected to rely upon Rule 430A of the 1933 Act
    Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and file with
    the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 of the 1933 Act
    Regulations Prospectuses that comply in all material respects

    forth the information specified in Section 2(a)(ii) hereof
    and all other information omitted from the prospectuses
    included in the Registration Statement as permitted by Rule
    430A.

              (b)  The Company will notify the U.S. 
    Representatives immediately, and confirm the notice in
    writing, (i) of the effectiveness of the Registration
    Statement and any amendment thereto (including any

    the Commission for filing of any revised prospectus which the
    Company proposes for use by the U.S. Underwriters or the
    Managers in connection with the offering of the Securities
    which differs from the prospectuses on file at the Commission
    at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective,
    (iii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission with
    respect to the Registration Statement or the Prospectuses,
    (iv) of any request by the staff of the Commission for any
    amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or
    supplement to the Prospectuses or for additional information,
    and (v) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order
    suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement,
    the suspension of the registration or qualification of the
    Securities for offering or sale under the securities laws of
    any state or jurisdiction or the initiation or threat of any
    proceedings for any such purpose.  The Company will make
    every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any such
    stop order or of any order suspending such registration or
    qualification and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the
    lifting thereof as promptly as practicable.

              (c)  The Company will give the U.S. Representatives
    notice of its intention to file or prepare any amendment to
    the Registration Statement (including any post-effective
    amendment) or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectuses
    (including any revised prospectus which the Company proposes
    for use by the U.S. Underwriters or the Managers in
    connection with the offering of the Securities which differs
    from the prospectuses on file at the Commission at the time
    the Registration Statement becomes effective, whether or not
    such revised prospectus is required to be filed pursuant to
    Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations), will furnish the
    U.S. Representatives with copies of any such amendment or
    supplement a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed
    filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file any such
    amendment or supplement to which the U.S. Representatives
    shall reasonably object unless the Company shall have (i)
    otherwise fully complied with its obligations contained in
    this subsection (c) and (ii) received a written opinion of
    counsel to the effect that such amendment or supplement is
    legally required under the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act
    Regulations.

              (d)  The Company has delivered or will deliver to
    the U.S. Representatives five signed copies of the
    Registration Statement as originally filed and each amendment
    thereto (including exhibits filed therewith) and has
    delivered or will deliver to the U.S. Representatives as many
    conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally
    filed and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) as the
    U.S. Representatives may reasonably request for delivery to
    each of the U.S. Underwriters.

              (e)  The Company will furnish to each U.S.
    Underwriter, from time to time during the period when the
    U.S. Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933
    Act or the 1934 Act, such number of copies of the U.S.
    Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) as such U.S.
    Underwriter may reasonably request for the purposes
    contemplated by the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the
    1934 Act or the 1934 Act Regulations.

              (f)  If at any time when a prospectus relating to
    the Securities is required to be delivered, any event shall
    occur as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable
    judgment of the U.S. Representatives based on the advice of
    their counsel, to amend or supplement the U.S. Prospectus in
    order to ensure that the U.S. Prospectus does not contain an
    untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
    material fact necessary in order to make the statements
    therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the
    time it is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, the
    Company will forthwith amend or supplement the U.S.
    Prospectus (and will provide drafts thereof to the U.S.
    Underwriters and provide them a reasonable opportunity to
    review such drafts and provide comments with respect thereto)
    so that, as so amended or supplemented, the U.S. Prospectus
    will not contain such an untrue statement or omission, and
    the Company will furnish to the U.S. Underwriters a
    reasonable number of copies of any such amendment or
    supplement to the U.S. Prospectus.

              (g)  The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with
    the U.S. Underwriters, to qualify the Securities for offering
    and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states
    and other jurisdictions of the United States as the U.S.
    Representatives may designate; provided, however, that the
    Company shall not be obligated (i) to qualify as a foreign
    corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so
    qualified, (ii) to take any action that would subject it to
    income or franchise taxation in any jurisdiction in which
    would not otherwise be subject to such taxation, (iii) to
    execute a consent to service of process under the laws of any
    jurisdiction (except service of process with respect to the
    offering and sale of the Securities).  In each jurisdiction
    in which the Securities have been qualified as above
    provided, the Company will file such statements and reports
    as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction to
    continue such qualification in effect for so long as it may
    be required to complete the distribution of such Securities.

              (h)  The Company will make generally available to
    its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later
    than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby,
    an earnings statement (which need not be audited, but in form
    complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the 1933 Act
    Regulations) covering a twelve-month period beginning not
    later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next
    following the "effective date" (as defined in said Rule 158)
    of the Registration Statement.

              (i)  The Company will use the net proceeds, if any,
    received by it from the sale of the Option Securities in the
    manner specified in the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds."

              (j)  The Company will file with the Commission such
    reports on Form SR as may be required pursuant to Rule 463 of
    the 1933 Act Regulations.

              (k)  The Company will use every reasonable effort
    to cause the Securities to be listed on the New York Stock
    Exchange.

              SECTION 4.  Certain Covenants of the Company and
    the Selling Stockholder.  The Company and the Selling
    Stockholder covenant with each of the U.S. Underwriters as
    follows:

              (a)  The Company and Selling Stockholder will be
    jointly and severally responsible for and will pay all

    disbursements of the Company's counsel and accountants, (v)
    the expenses in connection with the qualification of the
    Securities under state securities laws in accordance with the
    provisions of Section 3(g) hereof, including filing fees and
    the fees and disbursements of counsel for the U.S.
    Underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with
    the preparation of the Blue Sky Survey, (vi) the printing and
    delivery to the U.S. Underwriters as provided in this
    Agreement of copies of the Registration Statement as
    originally filed and of each amendment thereto, of each of
    the preliminary prospectuses, and of the Prospectuses and any
    amendments or supplements thereto, (vii) the printing and
    delivery to the U.S. Underwriters of copies of the Blue Sky
    Survey, (viii) the fees and expenses incurred in connection
    with any filings required to be made by the U.S. Underwriters
    with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. in
    connection with the offering and sale of the Securities and

    listing of the Securities on the New York Stock Exchange.

          (b)  If this Agreement is terminated by the U.S.
    Representatives in accordance with the provisions of Section
    5 hereof or Section 9(a)(i) hereof, the Company and the
    Selling Stockholder will be jointly and severally responsible
    for and will reimburse the U.S. Underwriters for all of their
    out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and
    disbursements of counsel for the U.S. Underwriters.

              (c)  During the period of 180 days from the date of
    the U.S. Pricing Agreement, the Company and the Selling
    Stockholder will not, without the prior written consent of
    the U.S. Representatives (which consent will not be
    unreasonably withheld), directly or indirectly, sell, offer
    to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise
    dispose of any shares of Common Stock or any security
    convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
    shares of Common Stock, except for (i) the issuance and sale
    by the Company to the Selling Stockholder of 14,999,900
    shares of Common Stock and associated Rights in accordance
    with the Stock Exchange Agreement, (ii) the sale by the
    Selling Stockholder of the Initial Securities to the
    Underwriters in accordance with this Agreement and the
    International Underwriting Agreement, (iii) the sale by the
    Selling Stockholder of 236,000 shares of Common Stock,
    together with the Rights associated with such shares, to
    certain members of the Company's management and their
    affiliates as contemplated by the Management Prospectus, (iv)
    the issuance by the Company of the Option Securities to the
    Underwriters in accordance with this Agreement and the
    International Underwriting Agreement and (v) the grant by the
    Company of options to purchase shares of Common Stock or the
    issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock pursuant to
    the O'Sullivan Incentive Stock Plan and other benefit plans
    as disclosed in the Prospectuses.

              (d)  Prior to the time at which the distribution of
    the Securities is completed, neither the Company nor the
    Selling Stockholder shall, directly or indirectly, (i) take
    any action designed to cause or result in, or that
    constitutes or might reasonably be expected to constitute,
    stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of
    the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the
    Securities or (ii) bid for, purchase or pay anyone any
    compensation for soliciting purchases of, the Securities.

          SECTION 5.  Conditions to Obligations of the U.S.
    Underwriters.  The obligations of the several U.S.
    Underwriters hereunder are subject to the accuracy of the
    representations and warranties of the Company and the Selling
    Stockholder herein contained at the date hereof and at
    Closing Time, to the performance by the Company and the
    Selling Stockholder of their respective obligations hereunder
    required to be performed prior to or at Closing Time, and to
    the following further conditions:

              (a)  The Registration Statement shall have become
    effective not later than 5:30 p.m. on the date hereof or at
    such later time and date as may be approved by the U.S.
    Representatives; and at Closing Time and any Date of
    Delivery, as the case may be, no stop order suspending the
    effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been
    issued under the 1933 Act or proceedings therefor initiated
    or threatened by the Commission.  If the Company has elected
    to rely upon Rule 430A of the 1933 Act Regulations,
    Prospectuses that set forth the initial public offering price
    per share of the Securities, the purchase price per share to
    be paid by the U.S. Underwriters, and any other information
    previously omitted from the effective Registration Statement
    pursuant to such Rule 430A shall have been transmitted to the
    Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act
    Regulations within the prescribed time period, and prior to
    Closing Time the Company shall have provided evidence
    reasonably satisfactory to the U.S. Representatives of such
    timely filing, or a post-effective amendment providing such
    information shall have been promptly filed and declared
    effective in accordance with the requirements of Rule 430A of
    the 1933 Act Regulations.

              (b)  At Closing Time the U.S. Representatives shall
    have received:

              (1)  The favorable opinion, dated as of Closing
         Time, of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson,
         counsel for the Company and the Selling Stockholder, in
         form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the U.S.
         Representatives, to the effect that:

                   (i)  The Company has been duly incorporated and
              is validly existing as a corporation in good
              standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

                   (ii)  The Company has corporate power and
              authority to own, lease and operate its properties
              and to conduct its business substantially as
              described in the Prospectus.

                   (iii)  To the knowledge of such counsel, the
              Company is duly licensed or qualified to conduct
              business as a foreign corporation and is in good
              standing in each jurisdiction set forth on Annex A
              to the opinion of such Counsel.

                   (iv)  Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company
              is validly existing as a corporation in good
              standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
              incorporation.

                   (v)  The authorized, issued and outstanding
              capital stock of the Company is as set forth in the
              Prospectuses under the column entitled "As
              Adjusted" under the caption "Capitalization."

                   (vi)  The 15,000,000 shares of Common Stock
              heretofore issued by the Company to the Selling
              Stockholder have been duly authorized and are
              validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; the
              1,800,000 shares of Common Stock subject to the
              option granted pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof have
              been duly authorized for issuance and sale to the
              Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement and the
              International Purchase Agreement and, when issued
              and delivered by the Company in accordance with
              this Agreement and the International Purchase
              Agreement against payment of the consideration set
              forth herein and therein, will be validly issued,
              fully paid and nonassessable.

                   (vii)  The issuance of the Securities is not
              subject to any preemptive or other similar rights
              to subscribe for or purchase the same arising under
              the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or
              By-laws of the Company or any of the agreements,
              contracts or instruments filed as Exhibits 10.1
              through 10.14 to the Registration Statement.

                   (viii)  Assuming that the Underwriters have
              taken physical possession of the Initial Securities
              to be sold by the Selling Stockholder at the
              Closing Time in good faith without notice of any
              adverse claim as such term is used in Section 8-302
              of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the
              State of New York, upon delivery of such Securities
              in registered form issued to the Underwriters and
              payment for such Securities as contemplated in this
              Agreement and the International Purchase Agreement,
              the Underwriters will acquire such Securities free
              and clear of all security interests, liens,
              encumbrances, equities or other adverse claims.

                   (ix)  The Common Stock conforms as to legal
              matters in all material respects to the statements
              concerning the Common Stock of the Company
              contained in the Prospectuses under the caption
              "Description of Capital Stock Common Stock."  The
              statements contained in the Prospectuses under the
              caption "Description of Capital Stock," insofar as
              they purport to summarize certain provisions of the
              Company's Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws,
              fairly summarize in all material respects such
              provisions.

                   (x)  The Rights conform as to legal matters in
              all material respects to the statements concerning
              the Rights contained in the Prospectuses under the
              caption "Description of Capital Stock Stockholder
              Rights Plan."

                   (xi)  The Company has all necessary corporate
              power and authority to execute and deliver this
              Agreement, the International Purchase Agreement,
              the U.S. Pricing Agreement and the International
              Pricing Agreement and to perform its obligations
              hereunder and thereunder; this Agreement, the
              International Purchase Agreement, the U.S. Pricing
              Agreement and the International Pricing Agreement
              have each been duly authorized, executed and
              delivered by the Company, and each constitutes a
              valid and binding agreement of the Company,
              enforceable in accordance with its terms (except to
              the extent that enforceability hereof or thereof is
              subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
              reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
              now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors'
              rights generally and (ii) general principles of
              equity (including, without limitation, standards of
              materiality, good faith, fair dealing and
              reasonableness), whether such principles are
              considered in a proceeding at law or in equity, and
              except that the rights to indemnification and
              contribution granted hereunder and thereunder may
              be limited by applicable federal and state
              securities laws or the public policy underlying
              such laws).

                   (xii)  The Selling Stockholder has all
              necessary corporate power and authority to execute
              and deliver this Agreement, the International
              Purchase Agreement, the U.S. Pricing Agreement and
              the International Pricing Agreement and to perform
              its obligations hereunder and thereunder; this
              Agreement, the International Purchase Agreement,
              the U.S. Pricing Agreement and the International
              Pricing Agreement have each been duly authorized,
              executed and delivered by the Selling Stockholder,
              and each constitutes a valid and binding agreement
              of the Selling Stockholder, enforceable in
              accordance with its terms (except to the extent
              that enforceability hereof or thereof is subject
              to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
              reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
              now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors'
              rights generally and (ii) general principles of
              equity (including, without limitation, standards of
              materiality, good faith, fair dealing and
              reasonableness, whether such principles are
              considered in a proceeding at law or in equity),
              and except that the rights to indemnification and
              contribution granted hereunder and thereunder may
              be limited by applicable federal and state
              securities laws or the public policy underlying
              such laws).

                   (xiii)  The execution, delivery and performance
              by the Company of this Agreement, the International
              Purchase Agreement, the U.S. Pricing Agreement and
              the International Pricing Agreement and the
              consummation by the Company of the transactions
              herein and therein contemplated (i) will not
              violate (A) any law or present regulation of any
              governmental agency or authority of the United

              (B) any agreement binding upon the Company or any
              of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties
              or any court decree or order binding upon the
              Company or any of its Subsidiaries (such opinion
              being limited to the decrees or orders that are set
              forth on Annex B to the opinion of such counsel and
              the agreements, contracts and instruments filed as
              Exhibits 10.1 through 10.14 to the Registration
              Statement (collectively, the "Covered Decrees,
              Orders, and Agreements")), (ii) will not result in
              a breach or violation of the terms or provisions of
              the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the
              Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) will
              not result in or require the creation or imposition
              of any security interest or lien upon any of their
              properties pursuant to the provisions of any
              agreement binding upon the Company or any of its
              Subsidiaries or their respective properties (such
              opinion being limited to the Covered Decrees,
              Orders and Agreements) (except for purposes of
              clause (i) and (iii), where such a violation or
              breach or resulting security interest or lien would
              not affect in any material respect the transactions
              contemplated by this Agreement or the International
              Purchase Agreement or have a material adverse
              effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
              business, properties or results of operation of the
              Company, Old O'Sullivan and their respective
              subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

                   (xiv)  The execution, delivery and performance
              by the Selling Stockholder of this Agreement, the
              International Purchase Agreement, the U.S.  Pricing
              Agreement and the International Pricing Agreement
              and the consummation by the Selling Stockholder of
              the transactions herein and therein contemplated
              (i) will not violate (A) any law or present
              regulation of any governmental agency or authority
              of the United States of America or the State of New
              York or the DGCL or (B) any agreement binding upon
              the Selling Stockholder or its properties or any
              court decree or order binding upon the Selling
              Stockholder (such opinion being limited to (1) the
              Covered Decrees, Orders, and Agreements and (2) the
              agreements, contracts and instruments to which the
              Selling Stockholder or its subsidiaries are parties
              or by which they are bound set forth on Annex C to
              the opinion of such counsel), (ii) will not result
              in a breach or violation of the terms or provisions
              of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of
              the Selling Stockholder, and (iii) will not result
              in or require the creation or imposition of any
              security interest or lien upon any of its
              properties pursuant to the provisions of any
              agreement binding upon the Selling Stockholder or
              its properties (such opinion being limited to (1)
              the Covered Decrees, Orders and Agreements and (2)
              the agreements, contracts and instruments to which
              the Selling Stockholder or its subsidiaries are
              parties or by which they are bound set forth on
              Annex C hereto) (except for purposes of clause (i)
              and (iii), where such a violation or breach or
              resulting security interest or lien would not
              affect in any material respect the transactions
              contemplated by this Agreement or the International
              Purchase Agreement or have a material adverse
              effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
              business, properties or results of operations of
              the Selling Stockholder and its subsidiaries, taken
              as a whole).

                   (xv)  No authorization, approval or consent
              of, or registration or filing with, any court or
              governmental authority or agency of the United
              States or the State of New York or under the DGCL
              is required for the execution, delivery or
              performance by the Company of this Agreement, the
              International Purchase Agreement, the U.S.  Pricing
              Agreement or the International Pricing Agreement or
              the consummation by the Company of the transactions
              contemplated herein and therein, except such as
              have been obtained or made under the 1933 Act, the
              1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act
              Regulations.

                   (xvi)  No authorization, approval or consent
              of, or registration or filing with, any court or
              governmental authority or agency of the United
              States or the State of New York or under the DGCL
              is required for the execution, delivery or
              performance by the Selling Stockholder of this
              Agreement, the International Purchase Agreement,
              the U.S. Pricing Agreement or the International
              Pricing Agreement or the consummation by the
              Selling Stockholder of the transactions
              contemplated herein and therein, except
              such as have been obtained or made under the 1933
              Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the
              1934 Act Regulations.

                   (xvii)  The Registration Statement became
              effective under the 1933 Act on January 26, 1994
              and any required filing of the Prospectuses
              pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations
              has been made within the time period required by
              such Rule.  To the knowledge of such counsel, no
              stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
              Registration Statement has been issued and no
              proceeding for that purpose is pending or
              threatened by the Commission.

                   (xviii)  The Registration Statement and the
              Prospectuses and any amendments or supplements
              thereto (except for (i) the financial statements,
              notes or schedules thereto and (ii) other financial
              information and statistical information included in
              the Registration Statement or Prospectuses, as to
              both of which such counsel need express no opinion)
              appear on their face to be appropriately responsive
              as to form in all material respects to the
              requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act
              Regulations.

                   (xix)  To the knowledge of such counsel, there
              are no contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan
              agreements, notes, leases or other instruments
              required to be described or referred to in the
              Registration Statement or to be filed as exhibits
              thereto other than those described or referred to
              therein or filed as exhibits thereto as required.

                   (xx)  The information set forth in the
              Prospectuses under the caption "Certain United
              States Tax Consequences to Non-United States
              Holders," to the extent that such information
              constitutes summaries of legal matters or
              documents, or legal conclusions, is true and
              correct in all material respects.

                   (xxi)  Each of the Company and Old O'Sullivan
              has all necessary corporate power and authority to
              execute and deliver each of the Reorganization
              Agreements to which it is a party and to perform
              its obligations thereunder.  Each of the
              Reorganization Agreements to which the Company or
              Old O'Sullivan is a party has been duly authorized,
              executed and delivered by each of them (to the
              extent each of them is a party thereto) and
              constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each
              of them (to the extent each of them is a party
              thereto), enforceable in accordance with its terms
              (except to the extent that enforceability thereof
              is subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy,
              insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
              similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting
              creditors' rights generally and (ii) general
              principles of equity (including, without
              limitation, standards of materiality, good faith,
              fair dealing and reasonableness), whether such
              principles are considered in a proceeding at law or
              in equity).

                   (xxii)  The Selling Stockholder has all
              necessary corporate power and authority to execute
              and deliver each of the Reorganization Agreements
              to which it is a party and to perform its
              obligations thereunder.  Each of the Reorganization
              Agreements to which the Selling Stockholder is a
              party has been duly authorized, executed and
              delivered by the Selling Stockholder and
              constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
              Selling Stockholder, enforceable in accordance with
              its terms (except to the extent that enforceability
              thereof is subject to (i) appliable bankruptcy,
              insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
              similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting
              creditors' rights generally and (ii) general
              principles of equity (including, without
              limitation, standards of materiality, good faith,
              fair dealing and reasonableness), whether such
              principles are considered in a proceeding at law or
              in equity).
     
                   (xxiii)  The execution, delivery and
              performance by the Company and Old O'Sullivan of
              the Reorganization Agreements to which each of them
              is a party and the consummation by the Company and
              Old O'Sullivan of the transactions contemplated
              therein (i) will not violate (A) any law or present
              regulation of any governmental agency or authority
              of the United States of America or the State of New
              York or the DGCL or (B) any agreement binding upon
              the Company or Old O'Sullivan or their respective
              subsidiaries or properties or any court decree or
              order binding upon the Company or Old O'Sullivan or
              their respective subsidiaries (such opinion being
              limited (x) to the Covered Decrees, Orders and
              Agreements and (y) in that such counsel need not
              express an opinion with respect to any violation
              arising under or based upon any cross-default
              provision insofar as such violation relates to a
              default under an agreement not filed as an exhibit
              to the Registration Statement or such violation
              arises under or is based upon any covenant of a
              financial or numerical nature or requires
              mathematic computation), (ii) will not result in a
              breach or violation of the terms or provisions of
              the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the
              Company or Old O'Sullivan or their respective
              subsidiaries, and (iii) will not result in or
              require the creation or imposition of any security
              interest or lien upon any of their properties
              pursuant to the provisions of any agreement binding
              upon the Company or Old O'Sullivan or their
              respective subsidiaries or properties (such opinion
              being limited to the Covered Decrees, Orders and
              Agreements) (except for purposes of clauses (i) and
              (iii), where such a violation or breach or
              resulting security interest or lien would not have
              a material adverse effect on the condition
              (financial or otherwise), business, properties or
              results of operations of the Company, Old
              O'Sullivan and their respective subsidiaries, taken
              as a whole).

                   (xxiv)  The execution, delivery and
              performance by the Selling Stockholder of the
              Reorganization Agreements to which it is a party
              and the consummation by the Selling Stockholder of
              the transactions contemplated therein (i) will not
              violate (A) any law or present regulation of any
              governmental agency or authority of the United
              States of America or the State of New York or the
              DGCL or (B) any agreement binding upon the Selling
              Stockholder or its properties or any court decree
              or order binding upon the Selling Stockholder (such
              opinion being limited (x) to (1) the Covered
              Decrees, Orders and Agreements and (2) the
              agreements, contracts and instruments to which the
              Selling Stockholder or its subsidiaries are parties
              or by which they are bound set forth on Annex C to
              the opinion of such counsel) and (y) in that such
              counsel need not express an opinion with respect to
              any violation arising under or based upon any
              cross-default provision insofar as such violation
              relates to a default under an agreement not filed
              as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or such
              violation arises under or is based upon any
              covenant of a financial or numerical nature or
              requires arithmetic computation), (ii) will not
              result in a breach or violation of the terms or
              provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or
              By-laws of the Selling Stockholder, and (iii) will
              not result in or require the creation or imposition
              of any security interest or lien upon any of its
              properties pursuant to the provisions of any
              agreement binding upon the Selling Stockholder or
              its properties (such opinion being limited to (1)
              the Covered Decrees, Orders and Agreements and (2)
              the agreements, contracts and instruments to which
              the Selling Stockholder or its subsidiaries are
              parties or by which they are bound set forth on
              Annex C to the opinion of such counsel) (except,
              for purposes of clauses (i) and (iii), where such a
              violation or breach or resulting security interest
              or lien would not affect in any material respect
              the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
              the International Purchase Agreement or have a
              material adverse effect on the condition (financial
              or otherwise), business, properties or results of
              operation of the Selling Stockholder and its
              subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

              In addition, such opinion will contain the
    following statements: In the course of the preparation by the
    Company and its counsel of the Registration Statement and
    Prospectuses, such counsel attended conferences with certain
    of the officers of the Company and the Selling Stockholder
    and representatives of the independent public accountants for
    the Company, the Underwriters and counsel to the
    Underwriters, at which the Registration Statement and the
    Prospectuses were discussed.  In addition, between the date
    of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and the
    time of delivery of this opinion, such counsel attended
    additional conferences with certain of the officers of the
    Company and the Selling Stockholder and representatives of
    the independent public accountants for the Company, at which
    the contents of the Registration Statement and Prospectuses
    were discussed to a limited extent.  Given the limitations
    inherent in the independent verification of factual matters
    and the character of determinations involved in the
    registration process, such counsel is not passing upon and
    does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy,
    completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the
    Registration Statement and the Prospectuses (other than as
    set forth in paragraphs (ix), (x) and (xx) above).  Subject
    to the foregoing and on the basis of the information such
    counsel gained in the performance of the services referred to
    above, including information obtained from officers and other
    representatives of the Company and the Selling Stockholder,
    no facts have come to such counsel's attention that cause
    such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at
    the time of the Registration Statement was declared effective
    by the Commission, contained any untrue statement of a
    material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
    be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein
    not misleading.  Also, subject to the foregoing, no facts
    have come to such counsel's attention that cause such counsel
    to believe that the Prospectuses, as of the date thereof, at
    Closing Time or at any Date of Delivery, contained or
    contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or
    omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
    statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
    which they were made, not misleading, except in each case
    that such counsel need not express a view or belief with
    respect to financial statements, notes or schedules thereto
    or other financial and statistical information included in
    the Registration Statement or Prospectuses.

              In rendering the foregoing opinion, such counsel
    shall be entitled to state that such counsel expresses no
    opinion regarding the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
    federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of
    New York and the DGCL.  In addition, such counsel shall be
    entitled to state that such counsel expresses no opinion
    regarding the securities or "blue sky" laws of any state or
    other non-federal jurisdiction in which the Securities are
    offered or sold.

              (2)  The favorable opinion, dated as of Closing
         Time, of Rowland H. Geddie, III, Vice President, General
         Counsel and Secretary of the Company, in form and
         substance reasonably satisfactory to the U.S.
         Representatives, to the effect that:

                   (i)  Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company
              has been duly incorporated and is validly existing
              as a corporation in good standing under the laws of
              the jurisdiction of its incorporation.

                   (ii)  Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company
              has all the necessary corporate power and authority
              to own, lease and operate its properties and to
              conduct its business as described in the
              Prospectuses.

                   (iii)  Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company
              is duly licensed or qualified to conduct business
              as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
              each jurisdiction set forth on Annex A to the
              opinion of such counsel.

                   (iv)  All of the issued and outstanding
              capital stock of each of the Subsidiaries of the
              Company has been validly issued and is fully paid
              and nonassessable and is, to the knowledge of such
              counsel, owned by the Company, directly or
              indirectly, free and clear of any security
              interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance,
              claim or equity.

                   (v)  To the knowledge of such counsel, there
              is no action, suit or proceeding before or by any
              court or governmental agency or body, domestic or
              foreign, now pending or threatened against the
              Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which (A) is
              required to be disclosed in the Registration
              Statement and the Prospectuses (other than as
              disclosed therein) or (B) might reasonably be
              expected to result in any material adverse change
              in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in
              the earnings, business affairs or business
              prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries
              considered as one enterprise.

                   (vi)  To the knowledge of such counsel, the
              Company is not in violation of its Certificate or
              By-laws, and no default by the Company or any of
              its Subsidiaries exists in the due performance or
              observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant
              or condition contained in any Covered Decrees,
              Orders, and Agreements, except for defaults that
              would not have a material adverse effect on the
              condition, financial or otherwise, or on the
              earnings, business affairs or business prospects of
              the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
              enterprise.

                   (vii)  The execution, delivery and performance
              by the Company of this Agreement, the International
              Purchase Agreement, the U.S. Pricing Agreement and
              the International Pricing Agreement and the
              consummation by the Company of the transactions
              herein and therein contemplated (i) will not
              violate (A) any law or present regulation of any
              governmental agency or authority of the State of
              Texas or Missouri or (B) any agreement or court
              decree or order known to such counsel and binding
              upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
              their respective properties (such opinion being
              limited to the Covered Decrees, Orders, and
              Agreements), and (ii) will not result in or require
              the creation or imposition of any security interest
              or lien upon any of their properties pursuant to
              the provisions of any agreement known to such
              counsel and binding upon the Company or any of its
              Subsidiaries or their respective properties.

                   (viii)  The execution, delivery and
              performance by the Company and Old O'Sullivan of
              the Reorganization Agreements to which each of them
              is a party and the consummation by the Company and
              Old O'Sullivan of the transactions contemplated
              therein (i) will not violate (A) any law or present
              regulation of any governmental agency or authority
              of the State of Texas or Missouri or (B) any
              agreement or court decree or order known to such
              counsel and binding upon the Company or Old
              O'Sullivan or their respective subsidiaries or
              properties and (ii) will not result in or require
              the creation or imposition of any security interest
              or lien upon any of their properties pursuant to
              the provisions of any agreement known to such
              counsel and binding upon the Company or Old
              O'Sullivan or their respective subsidiaries or
              properties (such opinion being limited to the
              Covered Decrees, Orders, and Agreements) (except in
              each case where such a violation or breach or
              resulting security interest or lien would not have
              a material adverse effect on the condition
              (financial or otherwise), business, properties or
              results of operations of the Company, Old
              O'Sullivan and their respective subsidiaries, taken
              as a whole).

         In rendering the foregoing opinion, such counsel shall
    be entitled to state that he expresses no opinion regarding
    the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of
    the United States, the laws of the State of Texas and
    (subject to the qualification set forth in the immediately
    following sentence) the laws of the State of Missouri.
    Insofar as the foregoing opinion relates to matters governed
    by the laws of the State of Missouri, such counsel shall be
    entitled to state that he has assumed, without investigation,
    that the laws of the State of Missouri are in all respects
    identical to the laws of the State of Texas.

         (3)  The favorable opinion, dated as of Closing Time, of
    Frederick W. Padden, General Counsel of the Selling
    Stockholder, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
    the U.S. Representatives, to the effect that:

              (i)  The Selling Stockholder is the sole record
         owner and, to the knowledge of such counsel, beneficial
         owner of the Initial Securities; to the knowledge of
         such counsel, the Selling Stockholder has valid and
         marketable title to the Initial Securities, free and
         clear of any claim, lien, security interest,
         encumbrance, restriction on transfer or other defect in
         title.

              (ii)  To the knowledge of such counsel, there are
         no contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements,
         notes, leases or other instruments required to be
         described or referred to in the Registration Statement
         or to be filed as exhibits thereto other than those
         described or referred to therein or filed as exhibits
         thereto as required.

              (iii)  The information set forth in the
         Prospectuses under the captions "Management Company
         Compensation and Benefits" and "Certain Transactions,"
         to the extent that such information constitutes
         summaries of legal matters, documents or proceedings,
         fairly summarizes in all material respects such legal
         matters, documents or proceedings.

              (iv)  The execution, delivery and performance by
         the Selling Stockholder of this Agreement, the
         International Purchase Agreement, the U.S.  Pricing
         Agreement and the International Pricing Agreement and
         the consummation by the Selling Stockholder of the
         transactions herein and therein contemplated (i) will
         not violate (A) any law or present regulation of any
         governmental agency or authority of the State of Texas
         or (B) any agreement or court decree or order known to
         such counsel and binding upon the Selling Stockholder
         or its properties and (ii) will not result in or
         require the creation or imposition of any security
         interest or lien upon any of its properties pursuant to
         the provisions of any agreement known to such counsel
         and binding upon the Selling Stockholder or its
         properties.

              (v)  The execution, delivery and performance by
         the Selling Stockholder of the Reorganization
         Agreements to which it is a party and the consummation
         by the Selling Stockholder of the transactions
         contemplated therein (i) will not violate (A) any law
         or present regulation of any governmental agency or
         authority of the State of Texas or (B) any agreement or
         court decree or order known to such counsel and binding
         upon the Selling Stockholder or its properties and (ii)
         will not result in or require the creation or
         imposition of any security interest or lien upon any of
         its properties pursuant to the provisions of any
         agreement known to such counsel and binding upon the
         Selling Stockholder or its properties (except in each
         case where such a violation or breach or resulting
         security interest or lien would not have a material
         adverse effect on the condition (financial or
         otherwise), business, properties or results of
         operation of the Selling Stockholder and its
         subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

         In rendering the foregoing opinion, such counsel shall
    be entitled to state that he expresses no opinion regarding
    the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of
    the United States and the laws of the State of Texas.

         (4)  The favorable opinion, dated as of Closing Time, of
    Baker & Botts, L.L.P., counsel for the Underwriters, with
    respect to the matters set forth in clauses (i), (vi), (vii)
    (solely as to preemptive rights arising by operation of law
    or under the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
    Company), (ix) (solely as to the matters addressed in the
    first sentence thereof), (xi) (solely as to the due
    authorization, execution and delivery of the U.S. Purchase
    Agreement and the International Purchase Agreement), (xii)
    (solely as to the due authorization, execution and delivery
    of the U.S.  Purchase Agreement and the International
    Purchase Agreement), (xvii) and (xviii) of subsection (b)(1)
    of this Section.

         Such opinion of Baker & Botts, L.L.P.  shall further
    state that nothing has come to the attention of such counsel
    that causes them to believe that the Registration Statement
    (other than the financial statements and schedules contained
    therein, including the notes thereto and the auditors'
    reports thereon, and the other financial and statistical data
    contained therein, as to which such counsel need not
    comment), at the time it became effective, contained an
    untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
    material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
    make the statements therein not misleading or that the
    Prospectus (other than the financial statements and schedules
    contained therein, including the notes thereto and the
    auditors' reports thereon, and the other financial and
    statistical data contained therein, as to which such counsel
    need not comment), at the Representation Date (unless the
    term "Prospectus" refers to a prospectus which has been
    provided to the Underwriters by the Company for use in
    connection with the offering of the Offered Securities which
    differs from the prospectus on file at the Commission at the
    Representation Date, in which case at the time it is first
    provided to the Underwriters for such use), included an
    untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
    material fact necessary in order to make the statements
    therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
    were made, not misleading.

         (c)  At Closing Time there shall not have been, since
    the date hereof or since the respective dates as of which
    information is given in the Prospectuses, any materialadverse
    change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or the
    earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the
    Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise,
    whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business,
    and the U.S. Representatives shall have received a
    certificate of the President or a Vice President of the
    Company and of the chief financial or chief accounting
    officer of the Company, dated as of Closing Time, to the
    effect that (i) there has been no such material adverse
    change, (ii) the representations and warranties of the
    Company contained in Section 1(a) of this Agreement are true
    and correct with the same force and effect as though
    expressly made at and as of Closing Time, (iii) the Company
    has complied with all covenants and agreements and satisfied
    all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or
    prior to Closing Time, and (iv) no stop order suspending the
    effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued
    and, to the knowledge of each such officer, no proceedings
    for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the
    Commission.  As used in this Section 5(c), the term
    "Prospectuses" shall mean the Prospectuses in the form first
    used to confirm sales of the Securities.

         (d)  At Closing Time the U.S. Representatives shall have
    received a certificate from the President or a Vice President
    of the Selling Stockholder and of the chief financial officer
    or chief accounting officer of the Selling Stockholder, dated
    as of Closing Time, to the effect that (i) the
    representations and warranties of the Selling Stockholder
    contained in Sections 1(a) and 1(b) of this Agreement are
    true and correct with the same force and effect as though
    expressly made at and as of Closing Time and (ii) the Selling
    Stockholder has complied with all covenants and agreements
    and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or
    satisfied at or prior to Closing Time.

         (e)  At the time of the execution of this Agreement, the
    U.S. Representatives shall have received from Price
    Waterhouse a letter dated such date, in form and substance
    satisfactory to the U.S. Representatives, to the effect that:

              (i)  they are independent public accountants with
         respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the
         meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations;

              (ii)  it is their opinion that the audited combined
         financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
         included in the Registration Statement and covered by
         their reports therein comply as to form in all material
         respects with the applicable accounting requirements of
         the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations with respect
         to registration statements on Form S-1;

              (iii)  on the basis of procedures (but not an audit
         in accordance with generally accepted auditing
         standards) consisting of (A) reading the minutes of
         meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors,
         and of the Company and its Subsidiaries since the date
         of the latest audited balance sheet as set forth in the
         minute books through a specified date not more than five
         business days prior to the date of this Agreement, (B)
         performing the procedures specified by the American
         Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review
         of interim financial information as described in SAS
         No. 71, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited
         condensed interim financial statements of the Company
         included in the Registration Statement and reading the
         unaudited interim financial statements of the Company
         for the period from December 31, 1993 to the date of
         latest available interim financial statements, and (C)
         making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who
         have responsibility for financial and accounting matters
         regarding the specific financial statement items
         referred to below, nothing has come to their attention
         that causes them to believe that (1) the unaudited
         condensed combined financial statements of the Company
         and its Subsidiaries included in the Registration
         Statement do not comply as to form in all material
         respects with the applicable accounting requirements of
         the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations or that any
         material modifications should be made to the unaudited
         condensed combined interim financial statements,
         included in the Registration Statement, for them to be
         in conformity with generally accepted accounting
         principles, or (2) at a specified date not more than
         five business days prior to the date of this Agreement,
         there was any change in the capital stock or any
         increase in the combined long-term debt of the Company
         and its Subsidiaries as compared with the amounts shown
         in the December 31, 1993 combined balance sheet included
         in the Registration Statement or, during the period from
         January 1, 1994 to a specified date not more than five
         business days prior to the date of this Agreement, there
         were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding
         period in the preceding year, in the combined net sales,
         the total or per share amounts of income before
         cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, or
         the net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
         except in all instances for changes, increases or
         decreases which the Registration Statement discloses
         have occurred or may occur, or except as specifically
         stated in such letter;

              (iv)  although they are unable to and do not
         express an opinion on the Pro Forma Combined Statements
         of Operations and Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet
         (collectively, the "Pro Forma Financial Statements")
         included in the Registration Statement, they have (A)
         read the Pro Forma Financial Statements, (B) made
         inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have
         responsibility for financial and accounting matters
         about the basis for their determination of the pro forma
         adjustments to the historical amounts in the Pro Forma
         Financial Statements and whether the Pro Forma Financial
         Statements comply in form in all material respects with
         the applicable accounting requirements of Rule 11-02 of
         Regulation S-X; and (C) proved the arithmetic accuracy
         of the application of the pro forma adjustments to the
         historical amounts in the Pro Forma Statements; on the
         basis of such procedures, and such other inquiries and
         procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing
         came to their attention that caused them to believe that
         the Pro Forma Financial Statements do not comply in form
         in all material respects with the applicable
         requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X and that
         the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied
         to the historical amounts in the compilation of such
         statements; and

              (v)  they have read, with respect to certain
         amounts, percentages and financial information which are
         included in the Registration Statement and Prospectuses
         and which have been specified by the U.S.
         Representatives, and have found such amounts,
         percentages and financial information to be in agreement
         with the relevant accounting and financial records of
         the Company and its Subsidiaries identified in such
         letter.

         (f)  At Closing Time the U.S.  Representatives shall
    have received from Price Waterhouse a letter, dated as of
    Closing Time, to the effect that they confirm the statements
    made in the letter furnished pursuant to subsection (e) of
    this Section, except that the "specified date" referred to in
    such letter shall be a date not more than five days prior to
    Closing Time and, if the Company has elected to rely on Rule
    430A of the 1933 Act Regulations, to the further effect that
    they have carried out procedures as specified in clause (v)
    of subsection (e) of this Section with respect to certain
    amounts, percentages and financial information specified by
    the U.S. Representatives and deemed to be a part of the
    Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430(A)(b) and have
    found such amounts, percentages and financial information to
    be in agreement with the relevant accounting and financial
    records of the Company and its Subsidiaries identified in
    such letter.

         (g)  At Closing Time the Securities shall have been
    approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject
    only to official notice of issuance.

         (h)  At the time of the execution of this Agreement, the
    Company shall have furnished to the U.S. Representatives
    "lock-up" letters (or other agreements or instruments
    acceptable to the U.S. Representatives), in form and
    substance reasonably satisfactory to the U.S.
    Representatives, signed by each of the persons designated in
    the Prospectuses as an executive officer or director of the
    Company, pursuant to which each such person shall agree not
    to sell, offer to sell, grant an option for the sale of, or
    otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of
    Common Stock or any securities convertible into or
    exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Stock for a
    period of 180 days from the U.S. Representation Date without
    the prior written consent of the U.S. Representatives (which
    consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except for a
    bona fide transaction entered into in good faith by such
    person with a member of such person's family or by the
    executor of such person's estate, provided that the recipient
    of such shares (unless such recipient is the executor or
    administrator of the estate of a deceased transferor) agrees
    in writing to be bound by the terms of the transferor's
    lock-up letter.

         (i)  At Closing Time and at each Date of Delivery, if
    any, counsel for the U.S. Underwriters shall have been
    furnished with such certificates, documents and opinions as
    they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them
    to pass upon the sale or issuance of the Securities as herein
    contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence
    the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or
    the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained.

         (j)  At Closing Time and at each Date of Delivery, if
    any, all actions, proceedings, instruments, opinions and
    documents required in connection with the consummation of the
    transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
    International Purchase Agreement at or prior to Closing Time
    or such Date of Delivery, as the case may be, shall be
    reasonably satisfactory to the U.S. Representatives.

         (k)  In the event the U.S. Underwriters exercise their
    option provided in Section 2(b) hereof to purchase all or any
    part of the U.S. Option Securities and the Date of Delivery
    specified by the U.S. Underwriters for any such purchase is a
    date other than the Closing Time, the obligation of the U.S.
    Underwriters to purchase all or any such portion of the U.S.
    Option Securities shall be subject, in addition to the
    foregoing conditions, to the accuracy of the representations
    and warranties of the Company and the Selling Stockholder
    herein contained at each Date of Delivery, to the performance
    by the Company and the Selling Stockholder of its obligations
    hereunder required to be performed prior to or at each Date
    of Delivery, and to the receipt by the U.S. Underwriters of
    the following:

              (1)  A certificate, dated such Date of Delivery, of
         the President or a Vice President of the Company and of
         the chief financial or chief accounting officer of the
         Company confirming that the certificate delivered at
         Closing Time pursuant to Section 5(c) hereof remains
         true as of such Date of Delivery.

              (2)  A certificate, dated such Date of Delivery, of

         Stockholder and of the chief financial or chief
         accounting officer of the Selling Stockholder confirming
         that the certificate delivered at Closing Time pursuant
         to Section 5(d) hereof remains true as of such Date of
         Delivery.
     
              (3)  The favorable opinion of Fried, Frank, Harris,
         Shriver & Jacobson, counsel for the Company, in form and
         substance reasonably satisfactory to the U.S.
         Representatives, dated such Date of Delivery, relatingto
         the Option Securities and otherwise to the same effect
         as the opinion required by Section 5(b)(1) hereof.

              (4)  The favorable opinion of Frederick W. Padden,
         General Counsel of the Selling Stockholder, in form and
         substance reasonably satisfactory to the U.S.
         Representatives, dated such Date of Delivery, relating
         to the Option Securities and otherwise to the same
         effect as the opinion required by Section 5(b)(2)
         hereof.

              (5)  The favorable opinion of Rowland H.  Geddie,
         III, Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of
         the Company, in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the U.S. Representatives, dated such
         Date of Delivery, relating to the Option Securities and
         otherwise to the same effect as the opinion required by

              (6)  The favorable opinion of Baker & Botts,
         L.L.P., counsel for the U.S. Underwriters, dated such
         Date of Delivery, relating to the Option Securities and

         from Price Waterhouse, in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the U.S. Representatives, substantially
         the same in scope and substance as the letter furnished
         pursuant to Section 5(f) hereof, except that the
         "specified date" in such letter shall be a date not more
         than five days prior to such Date of Delivery.

              If any condition specified in this Section shall
    not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled,
    this Agreement may be terminated by the U.S.  Representatives
    by notice to the Company and the Selling Stockholder at any
    time at or prior to Closing Time or (insofar as the

    of any party to any other party.  Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, the provisions of Sections 4(a), 4(b), 6 and 7
    hereof shall remain in effect following any such termination.

         statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
         statement or omission, if such settlement is effected
         with the written consent of the Company and the Selling
         Stockholder; and

              (iii)  against any and all expense whatsoever, as
         incurred (including the fees and expenses of counsel
         chosen by the U.S. Representatives), reasonablyincurred
         in investigating, preparing or defending against any
         litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any
         governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or
         any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue
         statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
         statement or omission, to the extent that any such
         expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;

    provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not
    apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the
    extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or
    alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon
    and conformity with written information furnished to the
    Company by any U.S. Underwriter through Merrill Lynch
    expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any
    amendment thereto) or any preliminary prospectus or the U.S.
    Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and
    provided, further, that this indemnity agreement with respect
    to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit
    of any U.S. Underwriter from whom the person asserting any
    such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses
    purchased Securities, any officer or director of such U.S.
    Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter, if a
    copy of the U.S. Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented
    if the Company shall have furnished any such amendments or
    supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of
    such Underwriter to such person, if such is required by law,
    at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such
    Securities to such person and if the U.S. Prospectus (as so
    amended or supplemented) would have corrected the defect
    giving rise to such loss, liability, claim, damage or
    expense.

               (b)  Each U.S. Underwriter agrees, severally and
    not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
    directors and each of its officers who signed the
    Registration Statement, the Selling Stockholder and each of
    its officers and directors and each person, if any, who
    controls the Company or the Selling Stockholder within the
    meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act against any and all
    loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the
    indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but
    only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or
    alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the
    Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including
    the information deemed to be part of the Registration
    Statement pursuant to Rule 430A(b) of the 1933 Act
    Regulations, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or
    the Prospectuses (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in
    reliance upon and in conformity with written information
    furnished to the Company by such U.S. Underwriter through
    Merrill Lynch expressly for use in the Registration Statement
    (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectuses (or any
    amendment or supplement thereto).

          (c)  Each indemnified party shall give notice as
    promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party
    of any action commenced against it in respect of which
    indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify
    any indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying
    party from any liability which it may have otherwise than on
    account of this indemnity agreement.  An indemnifying party
    may participate at its own expense in the defense of such
    action.  In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable
    for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in
    addition to any local counsel) separate from their own
    counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any
    one action or separate but similar or related actions in the
    same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations
    or circumstances.

              SECTION 7.  Contribution.  In order to provide for
    just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the
    indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 hereof is for
    any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified
    parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the
    Company, the Selling Stockholder and the U.S. Underwriters
    shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities,
    claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by
    said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company, the Selling
    Stockholder and one or more of the U.S. Underwriters, as
    incurred, in such proportions that the U.S. Underwriters are
    responsible for that portion represented by the percentage
    that the underwriting discount appearing on the cover page of
    the Prospectuses bears to the initial public offering price
    appearing thereon and the Company and the Selling Stockholder
    will be jointly and severally responsible for the balance;
    provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent
    misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
    1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
    who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For
    purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls a
    U.S. Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933
    Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such U.S.
    Underwriter, each director of the Company, each officer of
    the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each
    person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning
    of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to
    contribution as the Company, and each person who controls the
    Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the
    Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as
    the Selling Stockholder.

              SECTION 8.  Representations, Warranties and
    Agreements to Survive Delivery.  All representations,
    warranties, agreements and indemnities contained in this
    Agreement and the U.S. Pricing Agreement, or contained in
    certificates of officers of the Company or the Selling
    Stockholder submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative
    and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation
    made by or on behalf of any U.S. Underwriter or controlling
    person, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Selling
    Stockholder, and shall survive delivery of and payment for
    the U.S. Securities to or by the U.S.  Underwriters.

              SECTION 9.  Termination of Agreement.

              (a)  The U.S. Representatives may terminate this
    Agreement, by notice to the Company and the Selling
    Stockholder, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if
    there has been, since the date of this Agreement or since the
    respective dates as of which information is given in the
    Prospectuses, any material adverse change in the condition,
    financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs
    or business prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries
    considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the
    ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there has occurred
    any material adverse change in the financial markets in the
    United States or elsewhere or any outbreak of hostilities or
    escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis, the effect of
    which is such as to make it, in the reasonable judgment of
    the U.S. Representatives, impracticable to market the
    Securities or enforce contracts for the sale of the
    Securities, or (iii) if trading in the Common Stock has been
    suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange,
    or if trading generally on either the New York Stock Exchange
    or the American Stock Exchange has been suspended, or minimum
    or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum
    ranges for prices for securities have been required, by
    either of said exchanges or by order of the Commission or any
    other governmental authority, or if a banking moratorium has
    been declared by either federal or New York authorities.  As
    used in this Section 9(a), the term "Prospectuses" means the
    Prospectuses in the form first used to confirm sales of the
    Securities.

              (b)  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
    this Section, such termination shall be without liability of
    any party to any other party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    the provisions of Sections 4(a), 4(b), 6 and 7 shall remain
    in effect.

              (c)  This Agreement may also terminate pursuant to
    the provisions of Section 2(a)(ii) hereof, with the effect
    stated in such Section.

              SECTION 10.  Default by one or more U.S.
    Underwriters.  If any one or more of the U.S. Underwriters
    shall fail at Closing Time to purchase and pay for any of the
    Initial U.S. Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the
    U.S. Pricing Agreement and such failure to purchase shall
    constitute a default in the performance of its or their
    obligations hereunder and thereunder, the U.S.
    Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours
    thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-
    defaulting U.S.  Underwriters or any other underwriters to
    purchase all, but not less than all, of the Initial U.S.
    Securities not so purchased in such amounts as may be agreed
    upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the
    U.S. Underwriters shall not have completed such arrangements
    within said 24-hour period, then:

              (a)  if the number of Initial U.S. Securities not
    so purchased does not exceed 10% of the Initial U.S.
    Securities, the non-defaulting U.S. Underwriters shall be
    obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full
    amount thereof in the proportions that their respective
    underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting
    obligations of all non- defaulting U.S. Underwriters, or

              (b)  if the number of Initial U.S. Securities not
    so purchased equals or exceeds 10% of the Initial U.S.
    Securities, this Agreement shall terminate without liability
    on the part of any non-defaulting U.S. Underwriter.

              No action taken pursuant to this Section shall
    relieve any defaulting U.S. Underwriter from any liability it
    may have hereunder in respect of its default.

              In the event of any such default which does not
    result in a termination of this Agreement, the U.S.
    Representatives shall have the right to postpone Closing Time
    for such period, not exceeding seven days, as they shall
    determine, after consultation with the Company, in order that
    the required changes in the Registration Statement and the
    Prospectuses or in any other documents or arrangements may be
    effected.

              SECTION 11.  Information Furnished by U.S.
    Underwriters.  The U.S. Underwriters acknowledge that the
    statements contained in (i) the last paragraph of text on the
    outside front cover page of the U.S. Prospectus, (ii) the
    legend regarding stabilization activities on the inside front
    cover page of the U.S. Prospectus and (iii) the fourth,
    sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth and thirteenth paragraphs under
    the caption "Underwriting" in the U.S. Prospectus were
    included in the Registration Statement, the preliminary U.S
    prospectus and the U.S. Prospectus in reliance upon and in
    conformity with written information furnished to the Company
    by the U.S. Underwriters through Merrill Lynch expressly for
    use therein, and the Company and the Selling Stockholder
    acknowledge and agree that such statements constitute the
    only information so furnished to the Company by the U.S.
    Underwriters.

              SECTION 12.  Notices.  All notices and other
    communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
    deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by
    any standard form of telecommunication.  Notices to the U.S.
    Underwriters shall be directed to the U.S. Representatives in
    care of Merrill Lynch at World Financial Center, North Tower,
    250 Vesey Street, New York, New York 10281, to the attention
    of the Syndicate Department; notices to the Company shall be
    directed to it at 1900 Gulf Street, Lamar, Missouri 64759, to
    the attention of the General Counsel; and notices to the
    Selling Stockholder shall be directed to it at TE Electronics
    Technology Center, 200 Taylor Street, Suite 700, Fort Worth,
    Texas 76102, to the attention of the General Counsel.

              SECTION 13.  Parties.  This Agreement and the U.S.
    Pricing Agreement shall each inure to the benefit of and be
    binding upon the U.S. Underwriters, the Company and the
    Selling Stockholder and their respective successors.  Nothing
    expressed or mentioned in this Agreement or the U.S. Pricing
    Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any
    person, firm or corporation, other than the U.S.
    Underwriters, the Company and the Selling Stockholder and
    their respective successors and the controlling persons and
    officers and directors referred to in Sections 6 and 7 hereof
    and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or
    equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
    Agreement or the U.S. Pricing Agreement or any provision
    herein or therein contained.  This Agreement and the U.S.
    Pricing Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof
    and thereof are intended to be for the sole and exclusive
    benefit of the U.S. Underwriters, the Company and the Selling
    Stockholder and their respective successors, and said
    controlling persons and officers and directors and their
    heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no
    other person, firm or corporation.  No purchaser of
    Securities from any U.S. Underwriter shall be deemed to be a
    successor by reason merely of such purchase.

              SECTION 14.  Certain Actions; Authority of U.S.
    Representatives.  Any action required or permitted to be
    taken by the U.S. Underwriters under or in connection with
    this Agreement may be taken by them jointly or by Merrill
    Lynch.  The U.S. Representatives represent that they have
    been authorized by the other U.S. Underwriters to execute
    this Agreement and the U.S. Pricing Agreement on behalf of
    the other U.S. Underwriters.

              SECTION 15.  Governing Law and Time.  This
    Agreement and the U.S. Pricing Agreement shall be governed by
    and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
    York applicable to agreements made and to be performed in
    said state.  Except where otherwise provided, specified times
    of day refer to New York City time.

              SECTION 16.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be
    executed in one or more counterparts and, when a counterpart
    has been executed by each party, all such counterparts taken
    together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

                   If the foregoing is in accordance with your
    understanding of our agreement, please sign and return to the
    Company a counterpart hereof, whereupon this instrument along
    with all counterparts will become a binding agreement among
    the Company, the Selling Stockholder and each of the U.S.
    Underwriters.

                               Very truly yours,

                               O'SULLIVAN INDUSTRIES

    Dear Sirs:

              Reference is made to the U.S. Purchase Agreement,
    dated January __, 1994 (the "U.S. Purchase Agreement"), with
    respect to (i) the sale by the Selling Stockholder and the
    purchase by the several U.S. Underwriters named in Schedule A
    thereto, acting severally and not jointly, of an aggregate of
    11,764,000 shares (the "Initial U.S. Securities") of Common
    Stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Common Stock"), of
    O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc. (the "Company"),
    together with the Preferred Stock Purchase Rights of the
    Company (the "Rights") associated with such shares, and (ii)
    the grant by the Company to the U.S. Underwriters, acting
    severally and not jointly, of the option to purchase all or
    any part of the U.S. Underwriters' pro rata portion of up to
    an additional 1,800,000 shares of Common Stock, together with
    the Rights associated with such shares, to cover over-
    allotments.  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
    defined shall have the respective meanings assigned to them
    in the U.S. Purchase Agreement.

              Pursuant to Section 2(a) of the U.S. Purchase
    Agreement, the Company and the Selling Stockholder agree with
    each U.S. Underwriter as follows:

              (a)  The initial public offering price per share of
    the U.S. Securities shall be $_______.

              (b)  The purchase price per share for the U.S.
    Securities to be paid by the several U.S. Underwriters shall
    be $______, being an amount equal to the initial public
    offering price set forth above less $_______ per share.

              If the foregoing is in accordance with your
    understanding of our agreement, please sign and return to the

    Dear Sirs:

         O'Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
    corporation (the "Company"), and TE Electronics Inc., a
    Delaware corporation (the "Selling Stockholder"), confirm
    their agreement with you and each of the other underwriters
    named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Managers,"
    which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as
    hereinafter provided in Section 10 hereof), for whom Merrill
    Lynch International Limited ("MLI") and UBS Limited are
    acting as representatives (in such capacity, MLI and UBS
    Limited being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    "Lead Managers"), with respect to (i) the sale by the Selling
    Stockholder and the purchase by the Managers, acting
    severally and not jointly, of the respective number of shares
    of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Common Stock"),
    of the Company set forth in Schedule A hereto, together with
    the Preferred Stock Purchase Rights of the Company (the
    "Rights") associated with such shares, and (ii) the grant by
    the Company to the Managers, acting severally and not
    jointly, of the option described in Section 2(b) hereof to
    purchase all or any part of the Managers' pro rata portion of
    up to an additional 1,800,000 shares of Common Stock,
    together with the Rights associated with such shares, to
    cover over-allotments, in each case except as may otherwise
    be provided in the International Pricing Agreement (as
    hereinafter defined).  The 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock,
    together with the Rights associated with such shares, to be
    purchased by the Managers from the Selling Stockholder (the
    "Initial International Securities") and all or any part of
    the Managers' pro rata portion of 1,800,000 shares of Common
    Stock, together with the Rights associated with such shares,
    subject to the option described in Section 2(b) hereof (the
    "International Option Securities") are hereinafter
    collectively referred to as the "International Securities."

         It is understood that the Company and the Selling
    Stockholder are concurrently entering into a U.S. Purchase
    Agreement of even date herewith (the "U.S. Purchase
    Agreement") with respect to (i) the sale by the Selling
    Stockholder of 11,764,000 shares of Common Stock, together
    with the Rights associated with such shares (the "Initial
    U.S. Securities"), through arrangements with certain
    underwriters in the United States and Canada (the "U.S.
    Underwriters"), for whom Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
    Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch"), Wheat, First
    Securities, Inc., The Chicago Dearborn Company and Rauscher
    Pierce Refsnes, Inc. are acting as representatives (the "U.S.
    Representatives"), and (ii) the grant by the Company to the
    U.S. Underwriters of an option to purchase all or any part of
    the U.S. Underwriters' pro rata portion of up to an
    additional 1,800,000 shares of Common Stock, together with
    the Rights associated with such shares (the "U.S. Option
    Securities"), to cover over-allotments, in each case except
    as may otherwise be provided in the U.S. Pricing Agreement
    (as hereinafter defined).  The Initial U.S. Securities and
    the U.S. Option Securities are hereinafter collectively
    referred to as the "U.S. Securities."  It is understood that
    the Managers are not obligated to purchase, any Initial
    International Securities unless all of the Initial U.S.
    Securities are contemporaneously purchased by the U.S.
    Underwriters.

         The Managers and the U.S. Underwriters are hereinafter
    collectively referred to as the "Underwriters."  The Initial
    International Securities and the Initial U.S. Securities are
    hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Initial
    Securities."  The International Option Securities and the
    U.S. Option Securities are hereinafter collectively referred
    to as the "Option Securities."  The International Securities
    and the U.S. Securities are hereinafter collectively referred
    to as the "Securities."  Unless the context otherwise
    requires, all references contained herein to the Initial
    International Securities, the International Option
    Securities, the International Securities, the Initial U.S.
    Securities, the U.S. Option Securities, the U.S. Securities,
    the Initial Securities, the Option Securities and the
    Securities shall include the respective numbers of shares of
    Common Stock set forth above, together with the Rights
    associated with such shares.

         The Company and the Selling Stockholder understand that
    the Underwriters are concurrently entering into an
    Intersyndicate Agreement of even date herewith providing for
    the coordination of certain transactions among the
    Underwriters under the direction of the Lead Managers and the
    U.S. Representatives.

         Prior to the purchase and public offering of the
    International Securities by the several Managers, the
    Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Lead Managers,
    acting on behalf of the several Managers, shall enter into an
    agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the
    "International Pricing Agreement").  The International
    Pricing Agreement may take the form of an exchange of any
    standard form of written telecommunication among the Company,
    the Selling Stockholder and the Lead Managers and shall
    specify such applicable information as is indicated in
    Exhibit A hereto.  The offering of the International
    Securities will be governed by this Agreement, as
    supplemented by the International Pricing Agreement.  From
    and after the date of the execution and delivery of the
    International Pricing Agreement, this Agreement shall be
    deemed to incorporate, and all references to "this Agreement"
    or "herein" shall be deemed to include, the International
    Pricing Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise. 
    The initial public offering price and the purchase price with
    respect to the U.S. Securities shall be set forth in a
    separate instrument (the "U.S. Pricing Agreement"), the form
    of which is attached to the U.S. Purchase Agreement.  The
    price per share for the U.S. Securities to be purchased by
    the U.S. Underwriters pursuant to the U.S. Purchase Agreement
    shall be identical to the price per shares for the
    International Securities to be purchased by the Managers
    hereunder.

         The Company has filed with the United States Securities
    and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration
    statement on Form S-1 (Commission File No. 33-72120) to
    effect the registration of the Securities under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), has
    filed such amendments thereto, if any, as may have been
    required to the date hereof, and will file such additional
    amendments thereto as may hereafter be required.  Such
    registration statement includes two forms of prospectus for
    use in connection with the offering and sale of the
    Securities: the international prospectus, for use in
    connection with the offering and sale of Securities outside
    the United States and Canada to persons other than United
    States and Canadian persons and the U.S. prospectus, for use
    in connection with the offering and sale of Securities in the
    United States and Canada to United States and Canadian
    persons.  The international prospectus and U.S. prospectus
    are identical except that they contain different outside
    front and outside back cover pages and different sections
    under the caption "Underwriting" and the international
    prospectus contains an additional section under the caption
    "Certain United States Tax Consequences to Non-United States
    Holders." Such registration statement also includes a third
    form of prospectus relating to a separate offering of 236,000
    shares of Common Stock, together with the Rights associated
    with such shares, to certain members of the Company's
    management and their affiliates.  Such registration statement
    (as amended, if applicable) and the prospectuses constituting
    a part thereof at the time such registration statement
    becomes effective (including in each case the information, if
    any, deemed to be part thereof pursuant to Rule 430A(b) of
    the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933
    Act (the "1933 Act Regulations")), as from time to time
    amended or supplemented pursuant to the 1933 Act or
    otherwise, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration
    Statement." The international prospectus and the U.S.
    prospectus in the respective forms included in the
    Registration Statement are hereinafter referred to as the
    "International Prospectus" and the "U.S. Prospectus," except
    that if any revised prospectuses shall be provided to the
    Managers or the U.S. Underwriters by the Company for use in
    connection with the offering of the Securities which differ
    from the prospectuses on file at the Commission at the time
    the Registration Statement becomes effective (whether or not
    such revised prospectuses are required to be filed by the
    Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations),
    the terms "International Prospectus" and "U.S. Prospectus"
    shall refer to such revised prospectuses from and after the
    time they are first provided to the Managers or the U.S.
    Underwriters for such use.  The International Prospectus and
    the U.S. Prospectus are hereinafter referred to collectively
    as the "Prospectuses" and, each individually, as a
    "Prospectus." The prospectus relating to the separate
    offering of 236,000 shares of Common Stock and associated
    Rights to certain members of the Company's management and
    their affiliates in the form included in the Registration
    Statement is hereinafter referred to as the "Management
    Prospectus."

         The Company and the Selling Stockholder understand that
    the Managers propose to make a public offering of the
    International Securities as soon as the Lead Managers deem
    advisable after the Registration Statement becomes effective
    and the International Pricing Agreement has been executed and
    delivered.

         SECTION 1.  Representations and Warranties.

         (a)  The Company and the Selling Stockholder jointly and
    severally represent and warrant to each of the Managers
    (except that the Selling Stockholder does not make any
    representation or warranty with respect to the matters
    addressed by clauses (xii), (xvi), (xvii), (xviii) and (xxi)
    below) as of the date hereof and as of the date of the
    International Pricing Agreement (such latter date being
    hereinafter referred to as the "International Representation
    Date") as follows:

              (i)  At the time the Registration Statement becomes
         effective and at the International Representation Date,
         the Registration Statement will comply in all material
         respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the
         1933 Act Regulations and will not contain an untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
         fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
         the statements therein not misleading.  The
         Prospectuses, at the International Representation Date
         (unless the term "Prospectuses" refers to prospectuses
         which have been provided to the Managers and the U.S.
         Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with
         the offering of the Securities which differ from the
         prospectuses on file at the Commission at the time the
         Registration Statement becomes effective, in which case
         at the time such prospectuses are first provided to the
         Managers and the U.S. Underwriters for such use) and at
         Closing Time (as hereinafter defined) will not include
         an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
         a material fact necessary in order to make the
         statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
         under which they were made, not misleading; provided,
         however, that the representations and warranties in this
         subsection shall not apply to statements in or omissions
         from the Registration Statement or Prospectuses made in
         reliance upon and in conformity with information
         furnished to the Company in writing by any Manager
         through Merrill Lynch expressly for use in the
         Registration Statement or the Prospectuses.

              (ii)  Price Waterhouse, the accountants who
         reported on the combined financial statements included
         in the Registration Statement and the Prospectuses are
         independent public accountants with respect to the
         Company and its Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) as
         required by the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations.

              (iii)  The combined financial statements, including
         the notes thereto, included in the Registration
         Statement and the Prospectuses present fairly the
         combined financial position of the Company and its
         Subsidiaries as at the dates indicated and the combined
         results of operations and cash flows for the Company and
         its Subsidiaries for the periods specified; such
         financial statements have been prepared in conformity
         with generally accepted accounting principles applied on
         a consistent basis throughout the periods involved;
         there are no supporting schedules required to be
         included in the Registration Statement pursuant to the
         1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations (other than
         schedules which have been omitted therefrom because the
         required information is included in the combined
         financial statements, including the notes thereto,
         included in the Registration Statement and the
         Prospectuses).

              (iv)  The pro forma financial information included
         in the Registration Statement and the Prospectuses has
         been prepared in all material respects in accordance
         with the applicable rules and regulations of the
         Commission with respect to pro forma financial
         statements, presents fairly the information included
         therein and has been properly compiled on the pro forma
         basis described therein; in the opinion of the Company
         and the Selling Stockholder, the assumptions used in the
         preparation of such pro forma financial information are
         reasonable and the adjustments made thereto are
         appropriate to give effect to the transactions and
         events referred to therein.

              (v)  Since the respective dates as of which
         information is given in the Registration Statement and
         the Prospectuses, except as otherwise stated therein, or
         expressly contemplated thereby, (A) there has been no
         material adverse change in the condition, financial or
         otherwise, or the earnings, business affairs or business
         prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries considered
         as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the
         ordinary course of business, (B) there have been no
         transactions entered into by the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries, other than the reorganization transactions
         to be consummated prior to or at Closing Time as
         described in the Prospectuses under the caption "Certain
         Transactions Reorganization Transactions" and other
         transactions entered into in the ordinary course of
         business, which are material with respect to the Company
         and its Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise and
         (C) except for (1) the dividend in the amount of $40
         million to be paid to the Selling Stockholder by Old
         O'Sullivan (as hereinafter defined) prior to Closing
         Time as described in the Prospectuses under the caption
         "Certain Transactions Reorganization Transactions," (2)
         the final adjusting payment, if any, to be made by the
         Company to Tandy as a result of the accounting of the
         stockholders' equity of the Company at Closing Time
         described in the Prospectuses under the caption "Certain
         Transactions Reorganization Transactions" and (3) the
         dividend of one Right to be issued with respect to each
         share of Common Stock as described in the Prospectuses
         under the caption "Description of Capital Stock
         Stockholder Rights Plan," there has been no dividend or
         distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries on any class of their
         capital stock.

              (vi)  The Company has been duly incorporated and is

         foreign corporation to transact business and is in good
         standing in each jurisdiction in which such
         qualification is required, whether by reason of the
         ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
         business, except where the failure to have such
         corporate power or to be so qualified would not have a
         material adverse effect on the condition, financial or
         otherwise, or on the earnings, business affairs or
         business prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries
         considered as one enterprise.

              (vii)  Each Subsidiary of the Company has been duly
         incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in
         good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
         incorporation and has all necessary corporate power to
         own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its
         business as described in the Prospectuses, and each
         Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified as a foreign
         corporation to transact business and is in good standing
         in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is
         required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing
         of property or the conduct of business, except where the
         failure to have such corporate power or to be so
         qualified would not have a material adverse effect on
         the condition, financial or otherwise, or on the
         earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
         enterprise; all of the issued and outstanding capital
         stock of each such Subsidiary has been duly authorized
         and, at Closing Time, will be validly issued, fully paid

         equity, except any such security interest, mortgage,
         pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity that is
         disclosed in the Prospectuses.

         that would not affect in any material respect the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the U.S.
         Purchase Agreement and would not have a material adverse
         effect on the condition, financial or otherwise, or on
         the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of

              (xii)  No labor dispute with the employees of the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries exists or, to the

         the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of
         the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
         enterprise.

              (xiii)  There is no action, suit or proceeding
         before or by any court or governmental agency or body,

         which (A) is required to be disclosed in the
         Registration Statement and the Prospectuses, (B) might
         reasonably be expected to result in any material adverse
         change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in
         the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of
         the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
         enterprise or to materially and adversely affect their
         properties or assets or (C) might reasonably be expected
         to materially and adversely affect the consummation of
         the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
         U.S. Purchase Agreement; all pending legal or
         governmental proceedings to which the Company or any of
         its Subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their
         respective property or assets is the subject which are
         not described in the Registration Statement and the
         Prospectuses, including ordinary routine litigation
         incidental to their business, are, considered in the
         aggregate, not material.

              (xiv)  There are no contracts or documents which

         filed all federal, state, local and foreign income and
         franchise tax returns required to be filed through the

         such returns would not have a material adverse effect on
         the condition, financial or otherwise, or on the
         earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
         enterprise, and has paid all taxes due as shown thereon,
         and except for such taxes, if any, as are being
         contested in good faith and as to which adequate
         reserves have been provided, there is no tax deficiency
         asserted against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
         which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of
         its Subsidiaries, would have a material adverse effect
         on the condition, financial or otherwise, or on the
         earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
         enterprise.

         case free and clear of any security interests,
         mortgages, pledges, liens, encumbrances or charges of
         any kind, other than those which (A) are described in
         the Prospectuses or (B) could not materially impair or
         interfere with the use currently made by the Company or
         its Subsidiaries of the properties or assets to which it
         applies or otherwise have a material adverse effect on
         the condition, financial or otherwise, or on the
         earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
         enterprise.

              (xvii)  The Company and its Subsidiaries own or
         possess, or can acquire on reasonable terms, adequate
         rights to use the patents, patent rights, licenses,
         inventions, copyrights, know-how (including trade
         secrets and other unpatented or unpatentable proprietary
         or confidential information, systems or procedures),
         trademarks, service marks and trade names (collectively,
         "patent and proprietary rights") necessary to conduct
         the business now conducted by them, and neither the
         Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
         notice or is otherwise aware of any infringement of or
         conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to
         any patent and proprietary rights, except where such
         infringement or conflict, if the subject of an
         unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would not
         result in a material adverse change in the condition,
         financial or otherwise, or the earnings, business
         affairs or business prospects of the Company and its
         Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

              (xviii)  The Company and its Subsidiaries possess
         such licenses, permits, consents, orders, certificates
         or authorizations issued by appropriate federal, state,
         foreign or local regulatory agencies or bodies as are
         necessary to conduct the business now operated by them
         as described in the Prospectuses, except as disclosed in
         the Prospectuses and except where the failure to possess
         such licenses, permits, consents, orders, certificates
         or authorizations would not have a material adverse
         effect on the condition, financial or otherwise, or on
         the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of
         the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
         enterprise; and neither the Company nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings
         relating to the revocation or modification of any such
         licenses, permits, consents, orders, certificates or
         authorizations which, if the subject of an unfavorable
         decision, ruling or finding, would have a material
         adverse effect on the condition, financial or otherwise,
         or on the earnings, business affairs or business
         prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries considered
         as one enterprise.

              (xix)  Neither the Company nor any of its
         Subsidiaries is in violation of any existing applicable
         law, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation or court
         decree to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
         or any of their respective properties and assets are
         subject, except where such violation would not have a
         material adverse effect on the condition, financial or
         otherwise, or on the earnings, business affairs or
         business prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries
         considered as one enterprise; without limiting the
         generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any
         of its Subsidiaries has violated (A) any existing
         applicable foreign, federal, state or local law or
         regulation relating to the protection of human health
         and the environment, including but not limited to, any
         such law pertaining to hazardous or toxic substances or
         wastes, pollutants or contaminants (collectively,
         "Environmental Laws"), (B) the terms of any licenses,
         permits, consents, orders, certificates or

         Environmental Laws, (C) any federal or state law
         relating to discrimination in the hiring, promotion or
         pay of employees or any applicable federal or state
         wages and hours laws, or (D) any provisions of the
         Employee Retirement Income Security Act or the rules and
         regulations promulgated thereunder, except as disclosed
         in the Prospectus and except for any such violations
         which would not have a material adverse effect on the
         condition, financial or otherwise, or the earnings,
         business affairs or business prospects of the Company
         and its Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

              (xx)  The Company has reasonably concluded that,
         except as disclosed in the Prospectus, the costs and
         liabilities associated with compliance with
         Environmental Laws are not likely to have a material
         adverse effect on the condition, financial or otherwise,
         or the earnings, business affairs or business prospects
         of the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
         enterprise.

              (xxi)  The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain
         books and records and internal accounting controls which
         provide reasonable assurance that (A) transactions are
         executed all material respects in accordance with
         management's general or specific authorization, (B)
         transactions are recorded in all material respects as
         necessary to permit preparation of their financial
         statements and to maintain accountability for their
         assets and (C) access to assets that are material to the
         Company or its Subsidiaries is permitted only in
         accordance with management's general or specific
         authorization.

              (xxii)  At Closing Time, each of the Reorganization
         Agreements (as hereinafter defined) to which the Company
         or any of its Subsidiaries are or are proposed to be
         parties will be duly authorized, executed and delivered
         by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (to the
         extent that each of them is proposed to be a party
         thereto).  Substantially all of the assets to be
         transferred by Tandy Marketing Canada (as hereinafter
         defined) to Old O'Sullivan as described
         in the Prospectus have been transferred to Old
         O'Sullivan.

              (xxiii)  The execution, delivery and performance by
         the Company and each of its Subsidiaries of the
         Reorganization Agreements to which each of them is a
         party or is proposed to be a party and the consummation
         by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries of the
         transactions contemplated therein will not conflict with
         or constitute a breach or violation of, or default
         under, or result in the creation or imposition of any
         lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets
         of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to,
         any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note,
         lease or other agreement or instrument to which the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
         which it or any of them is bound, or to which any of the
         property or assets of the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries is subject, nor will such action result in
         any breach or violation of, or default under, the
         provisions of the charter or bylaws of the Company or
         any of its Subsidiaries or of any existing applicable
         law, administrative regulation or administrative or
         court decree, in each case, except as disclosed in the
         Prospectuses and except for such conflicts, breaches,
         violations, defaults, liens, charges or encumbrances
         that would not have a material adverse effect on the
         condition, financial or otherwise, or on the earnings,
         business affairs or business prospects of the Company
         and its Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.  

              (xxiv)  Neither the Company nor any of its
         Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company
         "controlled" by an "investment company" within the
         meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
         amended.  

              (xxv)  The Company and its Subsidiaries have
         complied with all provisions of Section 517.075, Florida
         Statutes (Chapter 92-198, Laws of Florida) relating to

         or affiliate located in Cuba.

    warrants to each of the Managers as of the date hereof and as
    of the International Representation Date as follows:

              (i)  At Closing Time, the Selling Stockholder will

         of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or
         assets of the Selling Stockholder pursuant to, any
         contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note,
         lease or other agreement or instrument to which the
         Selling Stockholder is a party or by which it is bound,
         or to which any of the property or assets of the Selling
         Stockholder is subject, nor will such action result in
         any breach or violation of, or default under, the
         provisions of the charter or bylaws of the Selling
         Stockholder or of any existing applicable law,
         administrative regulation or administrative or court
         decree.

         Regulations or under the securities laws of any state or
         other jurisdiction.

              (v)  At Closing Time, each of the Reorganization
         Agreements to which the Selling Stockholder is proposed
         to be a party will be duly authorized, executed and
         delivered by the Selling Stockholder; at Closing Time,
         each of the Reorganization Agreements to which the
         Selling Stockholder is proposed to be a party will
         constitute a valid and binding obligation of the
         Selling Stockholder, enforceable against the Selling

         or to which any of the property or assets of the Selling
         Stockholder is subject, nor will such action result in

    certificate signed by any officer of the Selling Stockholder
    and delivered to the Lead Managers or to counsel for the
    Managers under or in connection with this Agreement or at
    Closing Time or any Date of Delivery shall be deemed a
    representation and warranty by the Selling Stockholder to
    each Manager as to the matters covered thereby.

         SECTION 2.  Sale and Delivery to Managers;
    Reorganization Transactions; Closing.

         (a)  On the basis of the representations and warranties
    herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions
    herein set forth, the Selling Stockholder agrees to sell to
    each Manager, severally and not jointly, and each Manager,
    severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase from the
    Selling Stockholder, at the price per share set forth in the
    International Pricing Agreement, the number of Initial
    International Securities set forth in Schedule A opposite the
    name of such Manager (except as otherwise provided in the
    International Pricing Agreement), plus any additional number
    of Initial International Securities which such Manager may
    become obligated to purchase pursuant to the provisions of
    Section 10 hereof, subject, in each case, to such adjustments
    as the Lead Managers in their discretion shall make to
    eliminate any sales or purchases of fractional securities.

              (i)  If the Company has elected not to rely upon
         Rule 430A of the 1933 Act Regulations, the initial
         public offering price of the Securities and the purchase
         price per share to be paid by the several Managers for
         the International Securities have each been determined
         and set forth in the International Pricing Agreement,
         dated the date hereof, and an amendment to the
         Registration Statement and the Prospectuses will be
         filed before the Registration Statement becomes
         effective.

              (ii)  If the Company has elected to rely upon Rule
         430A of the 1933 Act Regulations, the purchase price per
         share to be paid by the several Managers for the
         International Securities shall be an amount equal to the
         initial public offering price, less an amount per share
         to be determined by agreement among the Company, the
         Selling Stockholder and the Lead Managers.  The initial
         public offering price per share of the Securities shall
         be a fixed price to be determined by agreement among the
         Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Lead Managers. 
         The initial public offering price per share and the
         purchase price, when so determined, shall be set forth
         in the International Pricing Agreement.  In the event
         that such prices have not been agreed upon and the
         International Pricing Agreement has not been executed
         and delivered by the parties thereto by the close of
         business on the fourth business day following the date
         of this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate
         forthwith, without liability of any party to any other
         party, unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, the
         Selling Stockholder and the Lead Managers.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of
         Sections 4(a), 6 and 7 hereof shall remain in effect
         following any such termination.

         (b)  In addition, on the basis of the representations
    and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and
    conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an
    option to the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, to
    purchase from the Company an aggregate of up to an additional
    1,800,000 shares of Common Stock, together with the Rights
    associated with such shares, at the price per share set forth
    in the International Pricing Agreement and the U.S. Pricing
    Agreement, of which 360,000 shares and associated Rights
    shall be the pro rata portion for the Managers and 1,440,000
    shares and associated Rights shall be the pro rata portion
    for the U.S. Underwriters.  The option hereby granted will
    expire on the 30th day after the date the Registration
    Statement becomes effective or, if the Company has elected to
    rely on Rule 430A of the 1933 Act Regulations, the 30th day
    after the International Representation Date, and may be
    exercised in whole or in part from time to time only for the
    purpose of covering over-allotments which may be made in
    connection with the offering and distribution of the Initial
    Securities upon notice by the Lead Managers and the U.S.
    Representatives to the Company setting forth the aggregate
    number of Option Securities as to which the several
    Underwriters are then exercising said option and the time and
    date of payment and delivery for such Option Securities.  Any
    such time and date of delivery for the International Option
    Securities (a "Date of Delivery") shall be determined by the
    Lead Managers but shall be not earlier than two nor later
    than seven full business days after the exercise of said
    option, nor in any event prior to Closing Time, unless
    otherwise agreed upon by the Lead Managers and the Company. 
    If the option is exercised as to all or any portion of the
    International Option Securities, each of the Managers, acting
    severally and not jointly, will purchase from the Company
    that proportion of the number of International Option
    Securities then being purchased which the number of Initial
    International Securities set forth in Schedule A opposite the
    name of such Manager (plus any additional number of Initial
    International Securities which such Manager may become
    obligated to purchase pursuant to the provisions of Section
    10 hereof) bears to the total number of Initial International
    Securities (except as otherwise provided in the International
    Pricing Agreement), subject, in each case, to such
    adjustments as the Lead Managers in their discretion shall
    make to eliminate any sales or purchases of fractional
    securities.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term
    "business day" means a day on which the New York Stock
    Exchange is open for trading.

         (c)  The Selling Stockholder and the Company agree with
    the several Underwriters that, immediately prior to Closing
    Time, (i) the Selling Stockholder will transfer to the
    Company, in exchange for the issuance by the Company of
    14,999,900 shares of Common Stock, together with the Rights
    associated with such shares (the receipt of which shares and
    associated Rights shall be subject to the obligations of the
    Selling Stockholder to sell the Initial Securities to the
    Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement and the U.S. Purchase
    Agreement), all the issued and outstanding shares of capital
    stock of O'Sullivan Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation
    and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Selling Stockholder
    ("Old O'Sullivan"), and (ii) the Company will accept such
    transfer and will issue such shares of Common Stock and
    associated Rights to the Selling Stockholder.  The foregoing
    transactions will be effected in accordance with a Stock
    Exchange Agreement (the "Stock Exchange Agreement") to be
    entered into between the Selling Stockholder and the Company
    after the execution and delivery of this Agreement but prior
    to Closing Time.  In addition, (i) Tandy Marketing (Canada)
    Ltd., an Alberta corporation ("Tandy Marketing Canada"), has
    transferred to Old O'Sullivan certain assets located in
    Canada that are used in connection with the business
    conducted by Old O'Sullivan, (ii) Tandy Corporation, the
    Selling Stockholder and the Company will enter into a Cross
    Indemnification Agreement (the "Cross Indemnification
    Agreement") prior to Closing Time pursuant to which the
    parties will agree to indemnify each other for certain claims
    and liabilities as specified therein, (iii) Tandy
    Corporation, the Selling Stockholder and the Company will
    enter into a Tax Sharing and Tax Benefit Reimbursement
    Agreement (the "Tax Agreement") prior to Closing Time
    pursuant to which (A) the parties will agree upon the
    allocation of certain federal, state and local taxes of Old
    O'Sullivan (including any adjustments to such taxes), (B) Old
    O'Sullivan and Tandy Corporation will agree to make elections
    under Sections 338(g) and 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended, and (C) Old O'Sullivan will agree
    to pay to the Selling Stockholder, as additional purchase
    price under the Stock Exchange Agreement, amounts
    approximately equal to certain federal tax benefits related
    to the increase in the tax basis of Old O'Sullivan's assets
     resulting from the consummation of the transactions
    contemplated by the Stock Exchange Agreement and the Sections
    338(g) and 338(h)(10) elections.  The Stock Exchange
    Agreement and Tax Agreement will be substantially in the
    respective forms filed as exhibits to the Registration
    Statement.  The Stock Exchange Agreement, Asset Transfer
    Agreement, Cross Indemnification Agreement and Tax Agreement
    are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    "Reorganization Agreements." Old O'Sullivan and each other
    direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company as of the
    Closing Time are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    "Subsidiaries."

         (d)  Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of
    certificates evidencing the Initial International Securities
    to be purchased by the Managers shall be made at the office
    of Baker & Botts, L.L.P., 2001 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas
    75201, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the
    Lead Managers, the Company and the Selling Stockholder, at
    9:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the fifth business day
    (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of
    Section 10 hereof) following the date of the execution of the
    International Pricing Agreement or such other time not later
    than ten business days after such date as shall be agreed
    upon by the Lead Managers, the Company and the Selling
    Stockholder (such time and date of payment and delivery being
    hereinafter referred to as "Closing Time").  In addition, in
    the event that any or all of the International Option
    Securities are purchased by the Managers, payment of the
    purchase price for, and delivery of certificates for, such
    International Option Securities shall be made at the
    above-mentioned office of Baker & Botts, L.L.P., or at such
    other place as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Lead
    Managers and the Company, on each Date of Delivery as
    specified in the notice from the Lead Managers to the
    Company.  Payment shall be made to the Selling Stockholder,
    with respect to the Initial International Securities, and to
    the Company, with respect to any International Option
    Securities, by certified or official bank check or checks
    drawn in New York Clearing House funds or similar next-day
    funds payable to the order of the Selling Stockholder or the
    Company, as the case may be, against delivery to the Lead
    Managers for the respective accounts of the Managers of
    certificates for the International Securities to be purchased
    by them.  Certificates evidencing the Initial International
    Securities and the International Option Securities, if any,
    shall be in such denominations and registered in such names
    as the Lead Managers may request in writing at least two
    business days before Closing Time or the Date of Delivery, as
    the case may be.  It is understood that each Manager has
    authorized the Lead Managers, for its account, to accept
    delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the purchase
    price for, the International Securities which it has agreed
    to purchase.  The Lead Managers, individually and not as
    representatives of the Managers, may (but shall not be
    obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for the
    International Securities to be purchased by any Manager whose
    check has not been received by Closing Time or the Date of
    Delivery, as the case may be, but such payment shall not
    relieve such Manager from its obligations hereunder.  The
    certificates evidencing the Initial International Securities
    and the International Option Securities to be purchased by
    the Managers will be made available in New York City for
    examination and packaging by the Lead Managers not later than
    10:00 a.m. on the last business day prior to Closing Time or
    the Date of Delivery, as the case may be.

         SECTION 3.  Certain Covenants of the Company.  The
    Company covenants with each of the Managers as follows:

         (a)  If the Company has elected not to rely upon Rule
    430A of the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly
    prepare and file with the Commission an amendment to the
    Registration Statement that sets forth the information
    specified in Section 2(a)(i) hereof and will make every
    reasonable effort to cause the Registration Statement to
    become effective as promptly as practicable.  If the Company
    has elected to rely upon Rule 430A of the 1933 Act
    Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and file with
    the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 of the 1933 Act
    Regulations Prospectuses that comply in all material respects
    with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and that set
    forth the information specified in Section 2(a)(ii) hereof
    and all other information omitted from the prospectuses
    included in the Registration Statement as permitted by Rule
    430A.

         (b)  The Company will notify the Lead Managers
    immediately, and confirm the notice in writing, (i) of the
    effectiveness of the Registration Statement and any amendment
    thereto (including any post-effective amendment), (ii) of the
    mailing or delivery to the Commission for filing of any
    revised prospectus which the Company proposes for use by the
    Managers or the U.S. Underwriters in connection with the
    offering of the Securities which differs from the
    prospectuses on file at the Commission at the time the
    Registration Statement becomes effective, (iii) of the
    receipt of any comments from the Commission with respect to
    the Registration Statement or the Prospectuses, (iv) of any
    request by the staff of the Commission for any amendment to
    the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to
    the Prospectuses or for additional information, and (v) of
    the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending
    the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the
    suspension of the registration or qualification of the
    Securities for offering or sale under the securities laws of
    any state or jurisdiction or the initiation or threat of any
    proceedings for any such purpose.  The Company will make
    every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any such
    stop order or of any order suspending such registration or
    qualification and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the
    lifting thereof as promptly as practicable.

         (c)  The Company will give the Lead Managers notice of
    its intention to file or prepare any amendment to the
    Registration Statement (including any post-effective
    amendment) or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectuses
    (including any revised prospectus which the Company proposes
    for use by the Managers or the U.S. Underwriters in
    connection with the offering of the Securities which differs
    from the prospectuses on file at the Commission at the time
    the Registration Statement becomes effective, whether or not
    such revised prospectus is required to be filed pursuant to
    Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations), will furnish the
    Lead Managers with copies of any such amendment or supplement
    a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing or
    use, as the case may be, and will not file any such amendment
    or supplement to which the Lead Managers shall reasonably
    object unless the Company shall have (i) otherwise fully
    complied with its obligations contained in this subsection
    (c) and (ii) received a written opinion of counsel to the
    effect that such amendment or supplement is legally required
    under the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations.

         (d)  The Company has delivered or will deliver to the
    Lead Managers five signed copies of the Registration
    Statement as originally filed and each amendment thereto
    (including exhibits filed therewith) and has delivered or
    will deliver to the Lead Managers as many conformed copies of
    the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each
    amendment thereto (without exhibits) as the Lead Managers may
    reasonably request for delivery to each of the Managers.

         (e)  The Company will furnish to each Manager, from time
    to time during the period when the International Prospectus
    is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934
    Act, such number of copies of the International Prospectus
    (as amended or supplemented) as such Manager may reasonably
    request for the purposes contemplated by the 1933 Act, the
    1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act or the 1934 Act
    Regulations.

         (f)  If at any time when a prospectus relating to the
    Securities is required to be delivered, any event shall occur
    as a result of which it is necessary, in the reasonable
    judgment of the Lead Managers based on the advice of their
    counsel, to amend or supplement the International Prospectus
    in order to ensure that the International Prospectus does not
    contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
    state a material fact necessary in order to make the
    statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
    existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, not
    misleading, the Company will forthwith amend or supplement
    the International Prospectus (and will provide drafts thereof
    to the Managers and provide them a reasonable opportunity to
    review such drafts and provide comments with respect thereto)
    so that, as so amended or supplemented, the International
    Prospectus will not contain such an untrue statement or
    omission, and the Company will furnish to the Managers a
    reasonable number of copies of any such amendment or
    supplement to the International Prospectus.

         (g)  The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the
    Managers, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale
    under the applicable securities laws of such other
    jurisdictions as the Lead Managers may designate; provided,
    however, that the Company shall not be obligated (i) to
    qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which
    it is not so qualified, (ii) to take any action that would
    subject it to income or franchise taxation in any
    jurisdiction in which would not otherwise be subject to such
    taxation, (iii) to execute a consent to service of process
    under the laws of any jurisdiction (except service of process
    with respect to the offering and sale of the Securities).  In
    each jurisdiction in which the Securities have been qualified
    as above provided, the Company will file such statements and
    reports as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction
    to continue such qualification in effect for so long as it
    may be required to complete the distribution of such
    Securities.

         (h)  The Company will make generally available to its
    security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than
    90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an
    earnings statement (which need not be audited, but in form
    complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the 1933 Act
    Regulations) covering a twelve-month period beginning not
    later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next
    following the "effective date" (as defined in said Rule 158)
    of the Registration Statement.

         (i)  The Company will use the net proceeds, if any,
    received by it from the sale of the Option Securities in the
    manner specified in the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds."

         (j)  The Company will file with the Commission such
    reports on Form SR as may be required pursuant to Rule 463 of
    the 1933 Act Regulations.
     
         (k)  The Company will use every reasonable effort to
    cause the Securities to be listed on the New York Stock
    Exchange.

         SECTION 4.  Certain Covenants of the Company and the
    Selling Stockholder.  The Company and the Selling Stockholder
    covenant with each of the Managers as follows:

         (a)  The Company and Selling Stockholder will be jointly

    connection therewith and in connection with the preparation
    of the Blue Sky Survey, (vi) the printing and delivery to the
    Managers as provided in this Agreement of copies of the

    thereto, (vii) the printing and delivery to the Managers of
    copies of the Blue Sky Survey, (viii) the fees and expenses
    incurred in connection with any filings required to be made
    by the Managers with the National Association of Securities
    Dealers, Inc. in connection with the offering and sale of the
    Securities and (ix) the fees and expenses incurred in
    connection with the listing of the Securities on the New York
    Stock Exchange.

         (b)  If this Agreement is terminated by the Lead
    Managers in accordance with the provisions of Section 5
    hereof or Section 9(a)(i) hereof, the Company and the Selling
    Stockholder will be jointly and severally responsible for and
    will reimburse the Managers for all of their out-of-pocket
    expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of
    counsel for the Managers.

         (c)  During the period of 180 days from the date of the
    International Pricing Agreement, the Company and the Selling
    Stockholder will not, without the prior written consent of
    the Lead Managers (which consent will not be unreasonably
    withheld), directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant
    any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of any
    shares of Common Stock or any security convertible into or
    exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of Common Stock,

    Agreement, (ii) the sale by the Selling Stockholder of the
    Initial Securities to the Underwriters in accordance with

    to certain members of the Company's management and their

    the issuance by the Company of the Option Securities to the

    the Company of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
    O'Sullivan Incentive Stock Plan and other benefit plans as
    disclosed in the Prospectuses.

         (d)  Prior to the time at which the distribution of the
    Securities is completed, neither the Company nor the Selling
    Stockholder shall, directly or indirectly, (i) take any
    action designed to cause or result in, or that constitutes or
    might reasonably be expected to constitute, stabilization or
    manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to
    facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities or (ii) bid
    for, purchase or pay anyone any compensation for soliciting
    purchases of, the Securities.

         SECTION 5.  Conditions to Obligations of the Managers.
    The obligations of the several Managers hereunder are subject
    to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
    Company and the Selling Stockholder herein contained at the
    date hereof and at Closing Time, to the performance by the
    Company and the Selling Stockholder of their respective
    obligations hereunder required to be performed prior to or at
    Closing Time, and to the following further conditions:

         (a)  The Registration Statement shall have become
    effective not later than 5:30 p.m.  on the date hereof or at

    the case may be, no stop order suspending the effectiveness
    of the Registration Statement shall have been issued under
    the 1933 Act or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened
    by the Commission.  If the Company has elected to rely upon
    Rule 430A of the 1933 Act Regulations, Prospectuses that set
    forth the initial public offering price per share of the
    Securities, the purchase price per share to be paid by the
    Managers, and any other information previously omitted from
    the effective Registration Statement pursuant to such Rule
    430A shall have been transmitted to the Commission for filing
    pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations within
    the prescribed time period, and prior to Closing Time the
    Company shall have provided evidence reasonably satisfactory
    to the Lead Managers of such timely filing, or a
    post-effective amendment providing such information shall
    have been promptly filed and declared effective in accordance
    with the requirements of Rule 430A of the 1933 Act
    Regulations.

         (b)  At Closing Time the Lead Managers shall have
    received:

         Time, of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson,
         counsel for the Company and the Selling Stockholder, in
         form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lead
         Managers, to the effect that:

                   (i)  The Company has been duly incorporated
              and is validly existing as a corporation in good
              standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

              authority to own, lease and operate its properties
              and to conduct its business substantially as
              described in the Prospectuses.

                   (iii)  To the knowledge of such counsel, the
              Company is duly licensed or qualified to conduct
              business as a foreign corporation and is in good

                   (iv)  Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company
              is validly existing as a corporation in good
              standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
              incorporation.

                   (v)  The authorized, issued and outstanding
              capital stock of the Company is as set forth in the
              Prospectuses under the column entitled "As
              Adjusted" under the caption "Capitalization."

                   (vi)  The 15,000,000 shares of Common Stock
              heretofore issued by the Company to the Selling
              Stockholder have been duly authorized and are
              validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; the
              1,800,000 shares of Common Stock subject to the
              option granted pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof have
              been duly authorized for issuance and sale to the
              Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement and the
              U.S. Purchase Agreement and, when issued and
              deliverd by the Company in accordance with this
              Agreement and the U.S. Purchase Agreement against
              payment of the consideration set forth herein and

              through 10.14 to the Registration Statement.

                   (viii)  Assuming that the Underwriters have
              taken physical possession of the Initial Securities
              to be sold by the Selling Stockholder at the

              which the Selling Stockholder or its subsidiaries
              are parties or by which they are bound set forth on
              Annex C hereto) (except, for purposes of clauses
              (i) and (iii), where such a violation or breach or
              resulting security interest or lien would not
              affect in any material respect the transactions
              contemplated by this Agreement or the U.S. Purchase
              Agreement or have a material adverse effect on the
              condition (financial or otherwise), business,
              properties or results of operation of the Selling
              Stockholder and its subsidiaries, taken as a
              whole).

         In addition, such opinion will contain the following
    statements: In the course of the preparation by the Company
    and its counsel of the Registration Statement and
    Prospectuses, such counsel attended conferences with certain
    of the officers of the Company and the Selling Stockholder
    and representatives of the independent public accountants for
    the Company, the Underwriters and counsel to the
    Underwriters, at which the Registration Statement and the
    Prospectuses were discussed.  In addition, between the date
    of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and the
    time of delivery of this opinion, such counsel attended
    additional conferences with certain of the officers of the
    Company and the Selling Stockholder and representatives of
    the independent public accountants for the Company, at which
    the contents of the Registration Statement and Prospectuses
    were discussed to a limited extent.  Given the limitations
    inherent in the independent verification of factual matters
    and the character of determinations involved in the
    registration process, such counsel is not passing upon and
    does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy,
    completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the
    Registration Statement and the Prospectuses (other than as
    set forth in paragraphs (ix), (x) and (xx) above).  Subject
    to the foregoing and on the basis of the information such
    counsel gained in the performance of the services referred to
    above, including information obtained from officers and other
    representatives of the Company and the Selling Stockholder,
    no facts have come to such counsel's attention that cause
    such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at
    the time of the Registration Statement was declared effective
    by the Commission, contained any untrue statement of a
    material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
    be stated therein or necessary to make the statement therein
    not misleading.  Also, subject to the foregoing, no facts
    have come to such counsel's attention that cause such counsel
    to believe that the Prospectuses, as of the date thereof, at
    Closing Time or at any Date of Delivery, contained or
    contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or
    omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
    statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
    which they were made, not misleading, except in each case
    that such counsel need not express a view or belief with
    respect to financial statements, notes or schedules thereto
    or other financial and statistical information included in
    the Registration Statement or Prospectuses.

         In rendering the foregoing opinion, such counsel shall
    be entitled to state that such counsel expresses no opinion
    regarding the laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal
    laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York
    and the DGCL.  In addition, such counsel shall be entitled to
    state that such counsel expresses no opinion regarding the
    securities or "blue sky" laws of any state or other
    non-federal jurisdiction in which the Securities are offered
    or sold.

              (2)  The favorable opinion, dated as of Closing
         Time, of Rowland H.  Geddie, III, Vice President,
         General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, in form
         and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lead
         Managers, to the effect that:

                   (i)  Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company
              has been duly incorporated and is validly existing
              as a corporation in good standing under the laws of
              the jurisdiction of its incorporation.

                   (ii)  Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company

              conduct its business as described in the
              Prospectuses.

                   (iii)  Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company
              is duly licensed or qualified to conduct business
              as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
              each jurisdiction set forth on Annex A to the
              opinion of such counsel.

                   (iv)  All of the issued and outstanding

              counsel, owned by the Company, directly or
              indirectly, free and clear of any security
              interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance,
              claim or equity.

                   (v)  To the knowledge of such counsel, there
              is no action, suit or proceeding before or by any

              required to be disclosed in the Registration
              Statement and the Prospectuses (other than as
              disclosed therein) or (B) might reasonably be
              expected to result in any material adverse change
              in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the
              earnings, business affairs or business prospects of
              the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
              enterprise.

                   (vi)  To the knowledge of such counsel, the

              or condition contained in any Covered Decrees,
              Orders, and Agreements, except for defaults that
              would not have a material adverse effect on the
              condition, financial or otherwise, or on the
              earnings, business affairs or business prospects of
              the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one
              enterprise.

                   (vii)  The execution, delivery and performance
              by the Company of this Agreement, the U.S. Purchase      
              Agreement, the International Pricing Agreement and
              the U.S. Pricing Agreement and the consummation by
              the Company of the transactions herein and therein
              contemplated (i) will not violate (A) any law or
              present regulation of any governmental agency or
              authority of the State of Texas or Missouri or (B)
              any agreement or court decree or order known to
              such counsel and binding upon the Company or any of
              its Subsidiaries or their respective properties
              (such opinion being limited to the Covered Decrees,
              Orders, and Agreements) and (ii) will not result in
              or require the creation or imposition of any
              security interest or lien upon any of their
              properties pursuant to the provisions of any
              agreement known to such counsel and binding upon
              the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
              respective properties.

              the Reorganization Agreements to which each of them
              is a party and the consummation by the Company and
              Old O'Sullivan of the transactions contemplated
              therein (i) will not violate (A) any law or present
              regulation of any governmental agency or authority
              of the State of Texas or Missouri or (B) any
              agreement or court decree or order known to such

              the creation or imposition of any security interest

              the provisions of any agreement known to such
              counsel and binding upon the Company or Old
              O'Sullivan or their respective subsidiaries or
              properties (such opinion being limited to the
              Covered Decrees, Orders and Agreements) (except
              in each case where such a violation or breach or
              resulting security interest or lien would not have
              a material adverse effect on the condition
              (financial or otherwise), business, properties or
              results of operations of the Company, Old

    Insofar as the foregoing opinion relates to matters governed

              (3)  The favorable opinion, dated as of Closing
          Time, of Frederick W.  Padden, General Counsel of the
          Selling Stockholder, in form and substance reasonably
          satisfactory to the Lead Manager, to the effect that:

                   (i)  The Selling Stockholder is the sole
              record owner and, to the knowledge of such counsel,
              beneficial owner of the Initial Securities; to the

              has valid and marketable title to the Initial
              Securities, free and clear of any claim, lien,

                   (ii)  To the knowledge of such counsel, there
              are no contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan
              agreements, notes, leases or other instruments
              required to be described or referred to in the
              Registration Statement or to be filed as exhibits
              thereto other than those described or referred to
              therein or filed as exhibits thereto as required.

                   (iii)  The information set forth in the
              Prospectuses under the captions "Management Company
              Compensation and Benefits" and "Certain
              Transactions," to the extent that such information
              constitutes summaries of legal matters, documents or
              proceedings, fairly summarizes in all material
              respects such legal matters, documents or
              proceedings.

                   (iv)  The execution, delivery and performance
              by the Selling Stockholder of this Agreement, the         
              U.S. Purchase Agreement, the International Pricing
              Agreement and the U.S. Pricing Agreement and the
              consummation by the Selling Stockholder of the
              transactions herein and therein contemplated (i)
              will not violate (A) any law or present regulation

              Selling Stockholder or its properties and (ii) will
              not result in or require the creation or imposition
              of any security interest or lien upon any of its
              properties pursuant to the provisions of any
              agreement known to such counsel and binding upon
              the Selling Stockholder or its properties.

                   (v)  The execution, delivery and performance
              by the Selling Stockholder of the Reorganization
              Agreements to which it is a party and the
              consummation by the Selling Stockholder of the
              transactions contemplated therein (i) will not
              violate (A) any law or present regulation of any
              governmental agency or authority of the State of
              Texas or (B) any agreement or court decree or
              order known to such counsel and binding upon the
              Selling Stockholder or its properties and (ii)
              will not result in or require the creation or
              imposition of any security interest or lien upon
              any of its properties pursuant to the provisions
              of any agreement known to such counsel and binding
              upon the Selling Stockholder or its properties
              (except in each case where such a violation or
              breach or resulting security interest or lien
              would not have a material adverse effect on the
              condition (financial or otherwise), business,
              properties or results of operation of the Selling
              Stockholder and its subsidiaries, taken as a
              whole).
              
              In rendering the foregoing opinion, such
         counsel shall be entitled to state that he expresses no
         opinion regarding the laws of any jurisdiction other
         than the federal laws of the United States and the laws
         of the State of Texas.

              (4)  The favorable opinion, dated as of Closing
         Time, of Baker & Botts, L.L.P., counsel for the
         Underwriters, with respect to the matters set forth in
         clauses (i), (vi), (vii) (solely as to preemptive rights
         arising by operation of law or under the Certificate of
         Incorporation and By-laws of the Company), (ix) (solely
         as to the matters addressed in the first sentence
         thereof), (xi) (solely as to the due authorization,
         execution and delivery of the International Purchase
         Agreement and the U.S. Purchase Agreement), (xii)
         (solely as to the due authorization, execution and
         delivery of the International Purchase Agreement and the
         U.S. Purchase Agreement), (xvii) and (xviii) of
         subsection (b)(1) of this Section.

              Such opinion of Baker & Botts, L.L.P. shall further
         state that nothing has come to the attention of such
         counsel that causes them to believe that the
         Registration Statement (other than the financial
         statements and schedules contained therein, including
         the notes thereto and the auditors' reports thereon, and
         the other financial and statistical data contained
         therein, as to which such counsel need not comment), at
         the time it became effective, contained an untrue
         statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
         material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
         to make the statements therein not misleading or that
         the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and
         schedules contained therein, including the notes thereto
         and the auditors' reports thereon, and the other
         financial and statistical data contained therein, as to
         which such counsel need not comment), at the
         Representation Date (unless the term "Prospectus" refers
         to a prospectus which has been provided to the
         Underwriters by the Company for use in connection with
         the offering of the Offered Securities which differs
         from the prospectus on file at the Commission at the
         Representation Date, in which case at the time it is
         first provided to the Underwriters for such use), included
         an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
         a material fact necessary in order to make the
         statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
         under which they were made, not misleading.

         (c)  At Closing Time there shall not have been, since
    the date hereof or since the respective dates as of which
    information is given in the Prospectuses, any material
    adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or
    the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the
    Company and its Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise,
    whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business,
    and the Lead Managers shall have received a certificate of
    the President or a Vice President of the Company and of the
    chief financial or chief accounting officer of the Company,
    dated as of Closing Time, to the effect that (i) there has
    been no such material adverse change, (ii) the
    representations and warranties of the Company contained in
    Section 1(a) of this Agreement are true and correct with the
    same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of
    Closing Time, (iii) the Company has complied with all
    covenants and agreements and satisfied all conditions on its
    part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to Closing
    Time, and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of
    the Registration Statement has been issued and, to the
    knowledge of each such officer, no proceedings for that
    purpose have been initiated or threatened by the Commission. 
    As used in this Section 5(c), the term "Prospectuses" shall
    mean the Prospectuses in the form first used to confirm sales
    of the Securities.

         (d)  At Closing Time the Lead Managers shall have
    received a certificate from the President or a Vice President
    of the Selling Stockholder and of the chief financial officer
    or chief accounting officer of the Selling Stockholder, dated
    as of Closing Time, to the effect that (i) the
    representations and warranties of the Selling Stockholder
    contained in Sections 1(a) and 1(b) of this Agreement are
    true and correct with the same force and effect as though
    expressly made at and as of Closing Time and (ii) the Selling
    Stockholder has complied with all covenants and agreements
    and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or
    satisfied at or prior to Closing Time.

         (e)  At the time of the execution of this Agreement, the
    Lead Managers shall have received from Price Waterhouse a
    letter dated such date, in form and substance satisfactory to
    the Lead Managers, to the effect that:

              (i)  they are independent public accountants with
         respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries within the
         meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations;

              (ii)  it is their opinion that the audited combined
         financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
         included in the Registration Statement and covered by
         their reports therein comply as to form in all material
         respects with the applicable accounting requirements of
         the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations with respect
         to registration statements on Form S-1;

              (iii)  on the basis of procedures (but not an audit
         in accordance with generally accepted auditing
         standards) consisting of (A) reading the minutes of
         meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors,
         and of the Company and its Subsidiaries since the date
         of the latest audited balance sheet as set forth in the
         minute books through a specified date not more than five
         business days prior to the date of this Agreement, (B)
         performing the procedures specified by the American
         Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review
         of interim financial information as described in SAS No.
         71, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited
         condensed interim financial statements of the Company
         included in the Registration Statement and reading the
         unaudited interim financial statements of the Company
         for the period from December 31, 1993 to the date of
         latest available interim financial statements, and (C)
         making inquiries of certain officials of the Company who
         have responsibility for financial and accounting matters
         regarding the specific financial statement items
         referred to below, nothing has come to their attention
         that causes them to believe that (1) the unaudited
         condensed combined financial statements of the Company
         and its Subsidiaries included the Registration Statement
         do not comply as to form in all material respects with
         the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act
         and the 1933 Act Regulations or that any material
         modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed
         combined interim financial statements, included in the
         Registration Statement, for them to be in conformity
         with generally accepted accounting principles, or (2) at
         a specified date not more than five business days prior
         to the date of this Agreement, there was any change in
         the capital stock or any increase in the combined
         long-term debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
         compared with the amounts shown in the December 31,
         1993 combined balance sheet included in the Registration
         Statement or, during the period from January 1, 1994 to
         a specified date not more than five business days prior
         to the date of this Agreement, there were any decreases,
         as compared with the corresponding period in the
         preceding year, in the combined net sales, the total or
         per share amounts of income before cumulative effect of
         change in accounting principle, or the net income of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries, except in all instances
         for changes, increases or decreases which the
         Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may
         occur, or except as specifically stated in such letter;

              (iv)  although they are unable to and do not
         express an opinion on the Pro Forma Combined Statements
         of Operations and Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet
         (collectively, the "Pro Forma Financial Statements")
         included in the Registration Statement, they have (A)
         read the Pro Forma Financial Statements, (B) made
         inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have
         responsibility for financial and accounting matters
         about the basis for their determination of the pro forma
         adjustments to the historical amounts in the Pro Forma
         Financial Statements and whether the Pro Forma Financial
         Statements comply in form in all material respects with
         the applicable accounting requirements of Rule 11-02 of
         Regulation S-X; and (C) proved the arithmetic accuracy
         of the application of the pro forma adjustments to the
         historical amounts in the Pro Forma Financial
         Statements; on the basis of such procedures, and such
         other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in
         such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused
         them to believe that the Pro Forma Financial Statements
         do not comply in form in all material respects with the
         applicable requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X
         and that the pro forma adjustments have not been
         properly applied to the historical amounts in the
         compilation of such statements; and

              (v)  they have read, with respect to certain
         amounts, percentages and financial information which are
         included in the Registration Statement and Prospectuses
         and which have been specified by the Lead Managers, and
         have found such amounts, percentages and financial
         information to be in agreement with the relevant
         accounting and financial records of the Company and its
         Subsidiaries identified in such letter.

         (f)  At Closing Time the Lead Managers shall have
    received from Price Waterhouse a letter, dated as of Closing
    Time, to the effect that they confirm the statements made in
    the letter furnished pursuant to subsection (e) of this
    Section, except that the "specified date" referred to in such
    letter shall be a date not more than five days prior to
    Closing Time and, if the Company has elected to rely on Rule
    430A of the 1933 Act Regulations, to the further effect that
    they have carried out procedures as specified in clause (v)
    of subsection (e) of this Section with respect to certain
    amounts, percentages and financial information specified by
    the Lead Managers and deemed to be a part of the Registration
    Statement pursuant to Rule 430(A)(b) and have found such
    amounts, percentages and financial information to be in
    agreement with the relevant accounting and financial records
    of the Company and its Subsidiaries identified in such
    letter.

         (g)  At Closing Time the Securities shall have been
    approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject
    only to official notice of issuance.

         (h)  At the time of the execution of this Agreement, the
    Company shall have furnished to the Lead Managers "lock-up"
    letters (or other agreements or instruments acceptable to the
    Lead Managers), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
    to the Lead Managers, signed by each of the persons
    designated in the Prospectuses as an executive officer or
    director of the Company, pursuant to which each such person
    shall agree not to sell, offer to sell, grant an option for
    the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly,
    any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into
    or exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Stock for a
    period of 180 days from the International Representation Date
    without the prior written consent of the Lead Managers (which
    consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except for a
    bona fide transaction entered into in good faith by such
    person with a member of such person's family or by the
    executor of such person's estate, provided that the recipient
    of such shares (unless the recipient is the executor or
    administrator of the estate of a deceased transferor) agrees
    in writing to be bound by the terms of the transferor's
    lock-up letter.

         (i)  At Closing Time and at each Date of Delivery, if
    any, counsel for the Managers shall have been furnished with
    such certificates, documents and opinions as they may
    reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass
    upon the sale or issuance of the Securities as herein
    contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to evidence
    the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or
    the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained.

         (j)  At Closing Time and at each Date of Delivery, if
    any, all actions, proceedings, instruments, opinions and
    documents required in connection with the consummation of the
    transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the U.S.
    Purchase Agreement at or prior to Closing Time or such Date
    of Delivery, as the case may be, shall be reasonably
    satisfactory to the Lead Managers.

         (k)  In the event the Managers exercise their option
    provided in Section 2(b) hereof to purchase all or any part
    of the International Option Securities and the Date of
    Delivery specified by the Managers for any such purchase is a
    date other than the Closing Time, the obligation of the
    Managers to purchase all or any such portion of the
    International Option Securities shall be subject, in addition
    to the foregoing conditions, to the accuracy of the
    representations and warranties of the Company and the Selling
    Stockholder herein contained at each Date of Delivery, to the
    performance by the Company and the Selling Stockholder of its
    obligations hereunder required to be performed prior to or at
    each Date of Delivery, and to the receipt by the Managers of
    the following:

              (1)  A certificate, dated such Date of Delivery, of
         the President or a Vice President of the Company and of
         the chief financial or chief accounting officer of the
         Company confirming that the certificate delivered at
         Closing Time pursuant to Section 5(c) hereof remains
         true as of such Date of Delivery.

              (2)  A certificate, dated such Date of Delivery, of
         the President or a Vice President of the Selling
         Stockholder and of the chief financial or chief
         accounting officer of the Selling Stockholder confirming
         that the certificate delivered at Closing Time pursuant
         to Section 5(d) hereof remains true as of such Date of
         Delivery.
     
              (3)  The favorable opinion of Fried, Frank, Harris,
         Shriver & Jacobson, counsel for the Company, in form and
         substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Managers,
         dated such Date of Delivery, relating to the Option
         Securities and otherwise to the same effect as the
         opinion required by Section 5(b)(1) hereof.

              (4)  The favorable opinion of Frederick W. Padden,
         General Counsel of the Selling Stockholder, in form and
         substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Managers,
         dated such Date of Delivery, relating to the Option
         Securities and otherwise to the same effect as the
         opinion required by Section 5(b)(2) hereof.

              (5)  The favorable opinion of Rowland H. Geddie,
         III, Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of
         the Company, in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the Lead Managers, dated such Date of
         Delivery, relating to the Option Securities and
         otherwise to the same effect as the opinion required by
         Section 5(b)(3) hereof.

              (6)  The favorable opinion of Baker & Botts,
         L.L.P., counsel for the Managers, dated such Date of
         Delivery, relating to the Option Securities and
         otherwise to the same effect as the opinion required by
         Section 5(b)(4) hereof.

              (7)  A letter, dated as of such Date of Delivery,
         from Price Waterhouse, in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the Lead Managers, substantially the
         same in scope and substance as the letter furnished
         pursuant to Section 5(f) hereof, except that the
         "specified date" in such letter shall be a date not more
         than five days prior to such Date of Delivery.

         If any condition specified in this Section shall not
    have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled,
    this Agreement may be terminated by the Lead Managers by
    notice to the Company and the Selling Stockholder at any time
    at or prior to Closing Time or (insofar as the provisions
    hereof relate to the Option Securities) any Date of Delivery
    and such termination shall be without liability of any party
    to any other party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
    provisions of Sections 4(a), 4(b), 6 and 7 hereof shall
    remain in effect following any such termination.

         SECTION 6.  Indemnification.

         (a) The Company and the Selling Stockholder jointly and
    severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Manager,
    each officer and director of any Manager and each person, if
    any, who controls any Manager within the meaning of Section
    15 of the 1933 Act as follows:

              (i)  against any and all loss, liability, claim,
         damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out
         of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
         material fact contained in the Registration Statement
         (or any amendment thereto), including the information
         deemed to be part of the Registration Statement pursuant
         to Rule 430A(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations, if
         applicable, or the omission or alleged omission
         therefrom of a material fact required to be stated
         therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
         misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or
         alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
         any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectuses (or any
         amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or
         alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary
         in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
         the circumstances under which they were made, not
         misleading;

              (ii)  against any and all loss, liability, claim,
         damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the
         extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any
         litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any
         governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or
         of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue
         statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
         statement or omission, if such settlement is effected
         with the written consent of the Company and the Selling
         Stockholder; and

              (iii)  against any and all expense whatsoever,
         as incurred (including the fees and expenses of counsel
         chosen by the Lead Managers), reasonably incurred in
         investigating, preparing or defending against any
         litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any
         governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or
         any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue
         statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
         statement or omission, to the extent that any such
         expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;

    provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not
    apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the
    extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or
    alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon
    and conformity with written information furnished to the
    Company by any Manager through Merrill Lynch expressly for
    use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto)
    or any preliminary prospectus or the International Prospectus
    (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided,
    further, that this indemnity agreement with respect to any
    preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any
    Manager from whom the person asserting any such losses,
    liabilities, claims, damages or expenses purchased
    Securities, any officer or director of such Manager or any
    person controlling such Manager, if a copy of the
    International Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if
    the Company shall have furnished any such amendments or
    supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of
    such Manager to such person, if such is required by law, at
    or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such
    Securities to such person and if the International Prospectus
    (as so amended or supplemented) would have corrected the
    defect giving rise to such loss, liability, claim, damage or
    expense.

         (b)  Each Manager agrees, severally and not jointly, to
    indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and
    each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement,
    the Selling Stockholder and each of its officers and
    directors and each person, if any, who controls the Company
    or the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15
    of the 1933 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim,
    damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in
    subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to
    untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements
    or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any
    amendment thereto), including the information deemed to be
    part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A(b)
    of the 1933 Act Regulations, if applicable, or any
    preliminary prospectus or the Prospectuses (or any amendment
    or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity
    with written information furnished to the Company by such
    Manager through Merrill Lynch expressly for use in the
    Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the
    Prospectuses (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

         (c)  Each indemnified party shall give notice as
    promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party
    of any action commenced against it in respect of which
    indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify
    any indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying
    party from any liability which it may have otherwise than on
    account of this indemnity agreement.  An indemnifying party
    may participate at its own expense in the defense of such
    action.  In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable
    for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in
    addition to any local counsel) separate from their own
    counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any
    one action or separate but similar or related actions in the
    same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations
    or circumstances.

         SECTION 7.  Contribution.  In order to provide for just
    and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the
    indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 hereof is for
    any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified
    parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the
    Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Managers shall
    contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims,
    damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said
    indemnity agreement incurred by the Company, the Selling
    Stockholder and one or more of the Managers, as incurred, in
    such proportions that the Managers are responsible for that
    portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting
    discount appearing on the cover page of the Prospectuses
    bears to the initial public offering price appearing thereon
    and the Company and the Selling Stockholder will be jointly
    and severally responsible for the balance; provided, however,
    that no person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
    (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall
    be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
    guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of
    this Section, each person, if any, who controls a Manager
    within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have
    the same rights to contribution as such Manager, and each
    director of the Company, each officer of the Company who
    signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any,
    who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of
    the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as
    the Company, and each person who controls the Selling
    Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the
    Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as
    the Selling Stockholder.

         SECTION 8.  Representations, Warranties and Agreements
    to Survive Delivery.  All representations, warranties,
    agreements and indemnities contained in this Agreement and
    the International Pricing Agreement, or contained in
    certificates of officers of the Company or the Selling
    Stockholder submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative
    and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation
    made by or on behalf of any Manager or controlling person, or
    by or on behalf of the Company or the Selling Stockholder,
    and shall survive delivery of and payment for the
    International Securities to or by the Managers.

         SECTION 9.  Termination of Agreement.

         (a)  The Lead Managers may terminate this Agreement, by
    notice to the Company and the Selling Stockholder, at any
    time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since
    the date of this Agreement or since the respective dates as
    of which information is given in the Prospectuses, any
    material adverse change in the condition, financial or
    otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business
    prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries considered as
    one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course
    of business, or (ii) if there has occurred any material
    adverse change in the financial markets in the United States
    or elsewhere or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation
    thereof or other calamity or crisis, the effect of which is
    such as to make it, in the reasonable judgment of the Lead
    Managers, impracticable to market the Securities or enforce
    contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading
    in the Common Stock has been suspended by the Commission or
    the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on
    either the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock
    Exchange has been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for
    trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for
    securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or
    by order of the Commission or any other governmental
    authority, or if a banking moratorium has been declared by
    either federal or New York authorities.  As used in this
    Section 9(a), the term "Prospectuses" means the Prospectuses
    in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities.

         (b)  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this
    Section, such termination shall be without liability of any
    party to any other party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
    provisions of Sections 4(a), 4(b), 6 and 7 shall remain in
    effect.

         (c)  This Agreement may also terminate pursuant to the
    provisions of Section 2(a)(ii) hereof, with the effect stated
    in such Section.

         SECTION 10.  Default by one or more Managers.  If any
    one or more of the Managers shall fail at Closing Time to
    purchase and pay for any of the Initial International
    Securities pursuant to this Agreement and the International
    Pricing Agreement and such failure to purchase shall
    constitute a default in the performance of its or their
    obligations hereunder and thereunder, the Lead Managers shall
    have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make
    arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Managers
    or any other underwriters to purchase all, but not less than
    all, of the Initial International Securities not so purchased
    in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms
    herein set forth; if, however, the Managers shall not have
    completed such arrangements within said 24-hour period, then:

         (a)  if the number of Initial International Securities
    not so purchased does not exceed 10% of the Initial
    International Securities, the non-defaulting Managers shall
    be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full
    amount thereof in the proportions that their respective
    underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting
    obligations of all non- defaulting Managers, or

         (b)  if the number of Initial International Securities
    not so purchased equals or exceeds 10% of the Initial
    International Securities, this Agreement shall terminate
    without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Manager.

         No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve
    any defaulting Manager from any liability it may have
    hereunder in respect of its default.

         In the event of any such default which does not result
    in a termination of this Agreement, the Lead Managers shall
    have the right to postpone Closing Time for such period, not
    exceeding seven days, as they shall determine, after
    consultation with the Company, in order that the required
    changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectuses or
    in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

         SECTION 11.  Information Furnished by Managers.  The
    Managers acknowledge that the statements contained in (i) the
    last paragraph of text on the outside front cover page of the
    International Prospectus, (ii) the legend regarding
    stabilization activities on the inside front cover page of
    the International Prospectus and (iii) the fourth, sixth,
    seventh, eighth, tenth and thirteenth paragraphs under the
    caption "Underwriting" in the International Prospectus were
    included in the Registration Statement, the preliminary
    International prospectus and the international Prospectus in
    reliance upon and in conformity with written information
    furnished to the Company by the Managers through Merrill
    Lynch expressly for use therein, and the Company and the
    Selling Stockholder acknowledge and agree that such
    statements constitute the only information so furnished to
    the Company by the Managers.

         SECTION 12.  Notices.  All notices and other
    communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
    deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by
    any standard form of telecommunication.  Notices to the
    Managers shall be directed to the Lead Managers c/o Merrill
    Lynch International Limited, Ropemaker Place, 25 Ropemaker
    Street, London EC2Y 9LY, England, to the attention of the
    Syndicate Department; notices to the Company shall be
    directed to it at 1900 Gulf Street, Lamar, Missouri 64759, to
    the attention of the General Counsel; and notices to the
    Selling Stockholder shall be directed to it at TE Electronics
    Technology Center, 200 Taylor Street, Suite 700, Fort Worth,
    Texas 76102, to the attention of the General Counsel.

         SECTION 13.  Parties.  This Agreement and the
    International Pricing Agreement shall each inure to the
    benefit of and be binding upon the Managers, the Company and
    the Selling Stockholder and their respective successors. 
    Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement or the
    International Pricing Agreement is intended or shall be
    construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than
    the Managers, the Company and the Selling Stockholder and
    their respective successors and the controlling persons and
    officers and directors referred to in Sections 6 and 7 hereof
    and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or
    equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
    Agreement or the International Pricing Agreement or any
    provision herein or therein contained.  This Agreement and
    the International Pricing Agreement and all conditions and
    provisions hereof and thereof are intended to be for the sole
    and exclusive benefit of the Managers, the Company and the
    Selling Stockholder and their respective successors, and said
    controlling persons and officers and directors and their
    heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no
    other person, firm or corporation.  No purchaser of
    Securities from any Manager shall be deemed to be a successor
    by reason merely of such purchase.

         SECTION 14.  Certain Actions; Authority of Managers. 
    Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Managers
    under or in connection with this Agreement may be taken by
    them jointly or by Merrill Lynch.  The Lead Managers
    represent that they have been authorized by the other
    Managers to execute this Agreement and the International
    Pricing Agreement on behalf of the other Managers.

         SECTION 15.  Governing Law and Time.  This Agreement and
    the International Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and
    construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
    York applicable to agreements made and to be performed in
    said state.  Except where otherwise provided, specified times
    of day refer to New York City time.

         SECTION 16.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be
    executed in one or more counterparts and, when a counterpart
    has been executed by each party, all such counterparts taken
    together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding 
    of our agreement, please sign and return to the Company a
    counterpart hereof, whereupon this instrument along with
    all counterparts will become a binding agreement between
    the Company and each of the Managers in accordance with its
    terms.

                             Very truly yours,

                             O'SULLIVAN INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

         Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company
    may be based, in so far as it relates to legal matters, upon
    a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel,
    unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable
    care should know, that the certificate or opinion or
    representations with respect to the matters upon which his
    certificate or opinion is based are erroneous.  Any such
    certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based, in so far as
    it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion
    of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the
    Company stating that the information with respect to such
    factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless
    such Counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care
    should know, that the certificate or opinion or
    representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.

         Where any Person is required to make, give or execute
    two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates,
    statements, opinions or other instruments under this
    Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form
    one instrument.

         SECTION 104.  Acts of Debentureholders.

         (a)  Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
    notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this
    Indenture to be given or taken by Debentureholders may be
    embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of
    substantially similar tenor signed by such Debentureholders
    in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except
    as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall
    become effective when such instrument or instruments are
    delivered to the Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly
    required, to the Company.  Such instrument or instruments
    (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are
    herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the
    Debentureholders signing such instrument or instruments.
    Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing
    appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose
    of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in
    favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner
    provided in this Section.

         (b)  The fact and date of the execution by any Person of
    any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit
    of a witness of such execution or by the certificate of any
    notary public or other officer authorized by law to take
    acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual
    signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the
    execution thereof.  Where such execution is by an officer of
    a corporation or a member or a partnership, on behalf of such
    corporation or partnership, such certificate or affidavit
    shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.  The
    fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or
    writing, or the authority of the person executing the same,
    may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee
    deems sufficient.

         (c)  The ownership of Debentures shall be proved by the
     Debenture Register.

         (d)  Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
    notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any
    Debenture shall bind the Holder of every Debenture issued
    upon the transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu
    thereof, in respect of anything done or suffered to be done
    by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or
    not notation of such action is made upon such Debenture.

         (e)  The Trustee may require such additional proof of
    any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem
    necessary.

         SECTION 105.  Notices, etc., to Trustee and Company.

         Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
    consent, waiver or Act of Debentureholders or other document
    provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon,
    given or furnished to, or filed with,

              (1)  the Trustee by any Debentureholder or by the
         Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder
         if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with
         the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or

              (2)  the Company by the Trustee or by any
         Debentureholder shall be sufficient for every purpose
         hereunder if in writing and, except as provided in
         Section 501 hereof, mailed, first-class postage prepaid,
         to the Company addressed to it at the address of its
         principal office specified in the first paragraph of
         this Indenture or at any other address previously
         furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.

         SECTION 106.  Notices to Debentureholders; Waiver.

         Where this Indenture provides for notice to
    Debentureholders of any event, such notice shall be
    sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly
    provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage
    prepaid, to each Debentureholder affected by such event, at
    his address as it appears in the Debenture Register, not
    later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest
    date, prescribed for the giving of such notice.  In any case
    where notice to Debentureholders is given by mail, neither
    the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice
    so mailed, to any particular Debentureholder shall affect the
    sufficiency of such notice with respect to other
    Debentureholders.  Where this Indenture provides for notice
    in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the
    Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or
    after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of
    such notice.  Waivers of notice by Debentureholders shall be
    filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a
    condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in
    reliance upon such waiver.

         In case, by reason of the suspension of publication of
    any Authorized Newspaper, or by reason of any other cause, it
    shall be impossible to make publication of any notice in an
    Authorized Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers as required by
    this Indenture, then such method of publication or
    notification as shall be made with the approval of the
    Trustee shall constitute a sufficient publication of such
    notice.

         SECTION 107.  Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

         If this Indenture is qualified under TIA and any
    provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with another
    provision hereof which is required to be included in this
    Indenture by any of the provisions of TIA, such required
    provision shall control.

         SECTION 108.  Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.

         The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of
    Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the
    construction hereof.

         SECTION 109.  Successors and Assigns.

         All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the
    Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so
    expressed or not.

         SECTION 110.  Separability Clause.

         In case any provision in this Indenture or in the
    Debentures shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
    validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
    provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired
    thereby.

         SECTION 111.  Benefits of Indenture.

         Nothing in this Indenture or in the Debentures, expressor
    implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties
    hereto and their successors hereunder and the Holders of
    Debentures, any benefit or any legal or equitable right,
    remedy or claim under this Indenture, except as provided in
    Article 1200.

         SECTION 112.  Governing Law.

         This Indenture shall be construed in accordance with and
    governed by the laws of the State of Texas.

         SECTION 113.  Immunity of Incorporators, Stockholders,
    Directors and Officers.

         No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or
    agreement contained in this Indenture or in any Debenture, or
    because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had
    against any incorporator, or against any past, present or
    future stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the
    Company, the Trustee or of any successor corporation, either
    directly or through the Company or the Trustee, whether by
    virtue of any constitution or statute or rule of law, or by
    the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise. 
    It is expressly understood and agreed that this Indenture and
    the Debentures are solely corporate obligations, that no
    personal liability whatever shall attach to, or is or shall
    be incurred by, the incorporators, stockholders, officers or
    directors of the Company, the Trustee, or of any successor
    corporation, or any of them, because of the creation of the
    indebtedness hereby authorized, or under or by reason of the
    obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this
    Indenture or in any of the Debentures, or implied therefrom,
    and that any and all such personal liability of, and any and
    all such rights and claims against, every such incorporator,
    stockholder, officer or director, are hereby expressly waived
    as a condition of, and as a consideration for, the execution
    of this Indenture and the issue of the Debentures.

         SECTION 114.  Payment and Redemption Dates.

         In any case where an Interest Payment Date, a Redemption
    Date or the date of Maturity of principal of any Debenture
    shall not be a Business Day, then payment of interest or
    principal (and premium, if any) shall be made on the next
    succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if
    made on the nominal date and no interest shall accrue for the
    period after said date.

                             TANDY CORPORATION

         This Debenture is one of a duly authorized issue of
    Debentures of the Company designated as its 10% Subordinated
    Debentures Due 1994 (herein called the "Debentures"), limited
    in aggregate principal amount to $58,000,000 issued and to be
    issued under an Indenture dated as of June 30, 1974 (herein
    called the "Indenture") between the Company and The Fort
    Worth National Bank, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee",
    which term includes any successor Trustee under the
    Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures
    supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement
    of the respective rights and duties thereunder of the
    Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debentures, and
    the terms upon which the Debentures are, and are to be,
    authenticated and delivered.

    together in the case of any such redemption with accrued
    interest to the Redemption Date.

         The indebtedness evidenced by the Debentures is, to the
    extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture,
    expressly subordinated and subject in right of payment to the
    prior payment in full of all Superior Debt, and this
    Debenture is issued subject to such provisions of the
    Indentures, and each Holder of this Debenture, by accepting
    the same, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions and
    authorizes the Trustee in his behalf to take such action as
    may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
    subordination as provided in the Indenture and appoints the
    Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.

         If an Event of Default shall occur, the principal of all
    the Debentures may be declared due and payable in the manner
    and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

         The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as
    therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification
    of the rights and obligations of the Company and rights of
    the Holders of the Debentures under the Indenture at any time
    by the Company with the consent of the Holders of 66 2/3% in
    aggregate principal amount of Debentures at the time
    Outstanding.  The Indenture also contains provisions
    permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate
    principal amount of the Debentures at the time Outstanding,
    on behalf of the Holders of all the Debentures, to waive
    compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
    Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
    their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder
    of this Debenture shall be conclusive and binding upon such
    Holder and upon all future Holders of this Debenture and of
    any Debenture issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange
    herefore or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such
    consent or waiver is made upon this Debenture.

         No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of
    this Debenture or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the
    obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
    unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any)
    and interest on this Debenture at the times, place, and rate,
    and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

         As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
    limitations therein set forth, this Debenture is transferable
    on the Debenture Register of the Company, upon surrender of
    this Debenture for registration of transfer at the office or
    agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
    of New York, New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a
    written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
    Company and the Debenture Registrar duly executed by, the
    Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and
    thereupon one or more new Debentures, of authorized
    denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount,
    will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

         The Debentures are issuable only as registered
    Debentures without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or such
    integral multiples, if any, of $1,000 as the company may from
    time to time authorize.  As provided in the Indenture and
    subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Debentures
    are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of
    Debentures of any authorized denomination, as requested by
    the Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge will be made for any such registration
    of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment
    of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
    charge payable in connection therewith.

    affected by notice to the contrary.

    the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
    Indenture.

         SECTION 303.  Execution, Authentication, Delivery and
    Dating.

         The Debentures shall be executed on behalf of the
    Company by its Chairman of the Board, its President or one of
    its Vice Presidents under its corporate seal reproduced
    thereon and attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant
    Secretaries.  The signature of any of these officers on the
    Debentures may be manual or facsimile.

         Debentures bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of
    individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the
    Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such
    individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices
    prior to the authentication and delivery of such Debentures
    or did not hold such offices at the date of such Debentures.

         At any time and from time to time after the execution
    and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver
    Debentures executed by the Company to the Trustee for
    authentication; and the Trustee shall authenticate and
    deliver such Debentures as in this Indenture provided and not
    otherwise.

         All Debentures shall be dated the date of their
    authentication.

         No Debenture shall be entitled to any benefit under this
    Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless
    there appears on such Debenture a certificate of
    authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
    executed by the Trustee or on behalf of the Trustee by the
    Authenticating Agency by manual signature, and such
    certificate upon any Debenture shall be conclusive evidence,
    and the only evidence, that such Debenture has been duly
    authenticated and delivered hereunder.

         SECTION 304.  Temporary Debentures.

         Pending the preparation of definitive Debentures, the
    Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall
    authenticate and deliver, temporary Debentures which are
    printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise
    produced, in any domination, substantially of the tenor of
    the definitive Debentures in lieu of which they are issued
    and with such appropriate insertions, omissions,
    substitutions and other variations as the officers executing
    such Debentures may determine, as evidenced by their
    execution of such Debentures.

         If temporary Debentures are issued, the Company will
    cause definitive Debentures to be prepared without
    unreasonable delay.  After the preparation of definitive
    Debentures, the temporary Debentures shall be exchangeable
    for definitive Debentures upon surrender of the temporary
    Debentures at the office or agency of the Company in the
    Place of Payment, without charge to the Holder.  Upon
    surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary
    Debentures, the Company shall execute and the Trustee or the
    Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver in
    exchange therefore a like principal amount of definitive
    Debentures of authorized denominations.  Until so exchanged,
    the temporary Debentures shall in all respects be entitled to
    the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive
    Debentures.

         SECTION 305.  Registration, Transfer and Exchange.

         The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate
    Trust Office of the Trustee a register (herein sometimes
    referred to as the "Debenture Register") in which, subject to
    such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company
    shall provide for the registration of Debentures and the
    registration of transfers of Debentures.  The Trustee is
    hereby appointed "Debenture Registrar" for the purpose of
    registering Debentures and transfers of Debentures as herein
    provided.

         Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any
    Debenture at the office or agency of the Company in the
    Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, the
    Company shall execute, and the Trustee or the Authenticating
    Agent on behalf of the Trustee shall authenticate and
    deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or
    transferees, one or more new Debentures of any authorized
    denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount.

         At the option of the Holder, Debentures may be exchanged
    for other Debentures of any authorized denominations, of a
    like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the
    Debentures to be exchanged at such office or agency. 
    Whenever any Debentures are so surrendered for exchange, the
    Company shall execute, and the Trustee or the Authenticating
    Agent shall authenticate and deliver, the Debentures which
    the Debentureholder making the exchange is entitled to
    receive.

         All Debentures issued upon any registration of transfer
    or exchange of Debentures shall be the valid obligations of
    the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the
    same benefits under this Indenture, as the Debentures
    surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

         Every Debenture presented or surrendered for
    registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by
    the Company or the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent) be
    duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
    transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the
    Debenture Registrar duly executed by he Holder thereof or his
    attorney duly authorized in writing.

         No service charge shall be made for any registration of
    transfer or exchange of Debentures, but the Company may
    require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
    governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with
    any registration of transfer or exchange of Debentures, other
    than exchanges pursuant to Section 304 or 906 not involving
    any transfer.

         The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register
    the transfer of or exchange any Debenture during a period
    beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day
    of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Debentures
    selected for redemption and ending at the close of business
    on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer
    of or exchange any Debenture so selected for redemption in
    whole or in part.

         SECTION 306.  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen
    Debentures.

         If (i) any mutilated Debenture is surrendered to the
    Trustee, or the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to
    their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any
    Debenture, and (ii) there is delivered to the Company and the
    Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them
    to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice
    to the Company or the Trustee that such Debenture has been
    acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute
    and upon its request the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent
    shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of
    any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debenture, a
    new Debenture of like tenor and principal amount, bearing a
    number not contemporaneously outstanding.

         In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
    Debenture has become or is about to become due and payable,
    the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new
    Debenture, pay such Debenture without surrender thereof
    except in the case of a mutilated Debenture, if the applicant
    for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the
    Trustee or the Authenticating Agent such security or
    indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them
    harmless and evidence to the satisfaction of the Company and
    the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such
    Debenture and of the ownership thereof.

         Upon the issuance of any new Debenture under this
    Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum
    sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
    may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses
    (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected
    therewith.

         Every new Debenture issued pursuant to this Section in
    lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Debenture shall
    constitute an original additional contractual obligation of
    the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen
    Debenture shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and
    shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture
    equally and proportionately with any and all other Debentures
    duly issued hereunder.

         The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall
    preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies
    with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated,
    destroyed, lost or stolen Debentures.

         SECTION 307.  Payment of Interest; Interest Rights
    Preserved.

         Interest on any Debenture which is payable, and is
    punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment
    Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Debenture
    (or one or more Predecessor Debentures) is registered at the
    close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
    interest; provided, however, if any Debenture or portion
    thereof is called for redemption and is payable on a date
    after the close of business on a Regular Record Date next
    preceding any Interest Payment Date and before the opening of
    business on such Interest Payment Date, and notice of such
    redemption has been mailed and funds for such redemption have
    been duly provided, interest accrued to the date fixed for
    the redemption of such Debenture or portion so called shall
    be paid only against surrender of the Debenture.

         Any interest on any Debenture which is payable, but is
    not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest
    Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall
    forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant
    Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder; and
    such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its
    option in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or Clause (2)
    below:

              (1)  The Company may elect to make payment of any
         Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the
         Debentures (or their respective Predecessor Debentures)
         are registered at the close of business on a Special
         Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest,
         which shall be fixed in the following manner.  The
         Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the
         amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each
         Debenture and the date of the proposed payment, and at
         the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee
         an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount
         proposed to be paid i respect of such Defaulted Interest
         or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee
         for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed
         payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust
         for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such
         Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided.
         Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date
         for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall
         be not more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the
         date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days
         after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the
         proposed payment.  The Trustee shall promptly notify the
         Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and
         at the expense of the company, shall cause notice of the
         proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the
         Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class
         postage prepaid, to each Debentureholder at his address
         as it appears in the Debenture Register, not less than
         10 days prior to such Special Record Date.  The Trustee
         may, in its discretion, in the name and at the expense
         of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published
         at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place
         of Payment, but such publication shall not be a
         condition precedent to the establishment of such Special
         Record Date.  Notice of the proposed payment of such
         Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefore
         having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted interest
         shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the
         Debentures (or their respective Predecessor Debentures)
         are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no
         longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).

              (2)  The Company may make payment of any Defaulted
         Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent
         with the requirements of any securities exchange on
         which the Debentures may be listed, and upon such notice
         as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice
         given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed
         payment pursuant to this Clause, such payment shall be
         deemed practicable by the Trustee.

         Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section,
    each Debenture delivered under this Indenture upon
    registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of
    any other Debenture shall carry the rights to interest
    accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such
    other Debenture.

         SECTION 308.  Persons Deemed Owners.

         The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or
    the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Debenture
    is registered as the owner of such Debenture for the purpose
    of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any)
    and (subject to Section 307) interest on such Debenture and
    for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such
    Debenture be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee
    nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected
    by notice to the contrary.

         SECTION 309.  Cancellation.

         All Debentures surrendered for payment, redemption,
    registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to
    any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the
    Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it.  The Company
    may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any
    Debentures previously authenticated and delivered hereunder
    which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever,
    and all Debentures so delivered shall be promptly cancelled
    by the Trustee.  No Debentures shall be authenticated in lieu
    of or in exchange for any Debentures cancelled as provided in
    this Section, except as expressly permitted by this
    Indenture.  All cancelled Debentures held by the Trustee
    shall be disposed of as directed by a Company Order.

         SECTION 310.  Authentication and Delivery of Original
    Issue.

         Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of this
    Indenture, or from time to time thereafter, Debentures up to
    the aggregate principal amount of $58,000,000 may be executed
    by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for
    authentication upon the original issue, and shall thereupon
    be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee upon Company
    Order, without any further action by the Company.

                     SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE

         SECTION 401.  Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.

         This Indenture shall cease to be of further effect
    (except as to any surviving rights of transfer or exchange of
    Debentures and as to the application of any funds deposited
    for the payment of principal (and premium, if any) and
    interest on the Debentures herein expressly provided for) and
    the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company,
    shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction
    and discharge of this Indenture, when

         (1)  either

              (A)  all Debentures theretofore authenticated and
         delivered (other than (i) Debentures which have been
         destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced
         or paid as provided in Section 306, and (ii) Debentures
         for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited
         in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company

         delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

              (B)  all such Debentures not theretofore delivered
         to the Trustee for cancellation

                   (i)  have become due and payable, or

                   (ii) will become due and payable at their
              Stated Maturity within one year, or

                   (iii) are to be called for redemption within 1
              year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee
              for the giving of notice of redemption by the
              Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the
              Company,

         and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii)
         above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the
         Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an
         amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
         indebtedness on such Debentures not theretofore
         delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal
         (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of such
         deposit (in the case of Debentures which have become due
         and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption
         Date, as the case may be;

              (2)  the Company has paid or caused to be paid all
         other sums payable hereunder by the Company;

              (4)  payment of such monies is not prohibited by
         the provisions of Section 1204.

    Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this
    Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee
    under Section 607 shall survive.

         SECTION 402.  Application of Trust Money.

         Subject to the provisions of Article 1200, all money
    deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be
    held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the
    provisions of the Debentures and this Indenture, to the

    the Trustee may determine, to Persons entitled thereto, of
    the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for whose
    payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee; but
    such money need not be segregated from other funds except to
    the extent required by law.

         (2)  default in the payment, whether or not prohibited
    by Article 1200, of the principal of (or premium, if any, on)
    any Debenture at its Maturity, except any Maturity occurring

    than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or
    whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt
    with), and continuance of such default or breach for a period
    of 30 days after there has been given, by registered or
    certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the
    Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 10% in
    principal amount of the Outstanding Debentures, a written
    notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to

    an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission
    by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally
    as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the
    Company in furtherance of any such action.

         SECTION 502.  Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and
    Annulment.

         If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then
    and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less
    than 25% in principal amount of the Debentures Outstanding
    may declare the principal of all the Debentures to be due and
    payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company
    (and to the Trustee if given by Debentureholders), and upon
    any such declaration such principal shall become immediately
    due and payable.

         At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has
    been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the
    money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in
    this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal
    amount of the Debentures Outstanding, by written notice to
    the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such
    declaration and its consequences if

              (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the
         Trustee a sum sufficient to pay

                   (A)  all overdue installments of interest on
              all Debentures,

                   (B)  the principal of (and premium, if any,
              on) any Debentures which have become due otherwise
              than by such declaration of acceleration and
              interest thereon at the rate borne by the
              Debentures,

                   (C)  to the extent that payment of such
              interest is lawful, interest upon overdue
              installments of interest at the rate borne by the
              Debentures, and

                   (D)  all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee
              hereunder and the reasonable compensation,
              expenses, disbursements and advances of the
              Trustee, its agents and counsel;

         and

              (2)  all Events of Default, other than the
         non-payment of the principal of Debentures which have
         become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured
         or waived as provided in Section 513.

    No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or
    impair any right consequent thereon.

         SECTION 503.  Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for
    Enforcement by Trustee.

         The Company covenants that if

              (1)  default is made in the payment of any
         instalment of interest on any Debenture when such
         interest becomes due and payable and such default
         continues for a period of 30 days, or

              (2)  default is made in the payment of the
         principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Debenture at
         the Maturity thereof, except any Maturity occurring by
         reason of a call for redemption,

    the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for
    the benefit of the Holders of such Debentures, the whole
    amount then due and payable on such Debentures for principal
    (and premium, if any) and interest, with interest upon the
    overdue principal (and premium, if any) and, to the extent
    that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable,
    upon overdue instalments of interest, at the rate specified
    in the Debentures; and, in addition thereto, such further
    amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses
    of collection, including the reasonable compensation,
    expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its
    agents and counsel.

         If the Company fails to pay such amount forthwith upon
    such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of
    an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the
    collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute
    such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce
    the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the
    Debentures and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be
    payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of
    the Company or any other obligor upon the Debentures,
    wherever situated.

         If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the
    Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce
    its rights and the rights of the Debentureholders by such
    appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem
    most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights,
    whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or
    agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any
    power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

         SECTION 504.  Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

         In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency,
    liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
    adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative
    to the Company or any other obligor upon the Debentures or
    the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their
    creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal
    of the Debentures shall then be due and payable as therein
    expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
    whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company
    for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be
    entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
    otherwise,

              (1)  to file and prove a claim for the whole amount
         of principal (and premium, if any) and interest owing
         and unpaid in respect of the Debentures and to file such
         other papers or documents as may be necessary or
         advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee
         (including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
         expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its
         agents and counsel) and of the Debentureholders allowed
         in such judicial proceeding, and

              (2)  to collect and receive any moneys or other
         property payable or deliverable on any such claims and
         to distribute the same;

    and any receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator
    (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding
    is hereby authorized by each Debentureholder to make such
    payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee
    shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the
    Debentureholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it
    for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
    advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any
    other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.

         Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize
    the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on
    behalf of any Debentureholder any plan or reorganization,
    arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
    Debentures or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to
    authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any
    Debentureholder in any such proceeding.

         SECTION 505.  Trustee May Enforce Claims Without
    Possession of Debentures.

         All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or
    the Debentures may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee
    without the possession of any of the Debentures or the
    production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and
    any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be
    brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and
    any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the
    payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses,
    disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
    counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the
    Debentures in respect of which such judgment has been
    recovered.

         SECTION 506.  Application of Money Collected.

         Subject to the provisions of Article 1200, any money
    collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be
    applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by
    the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on
    account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, upon
    presentation of the Debentures and the notation thereon of
    the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof
    if fully paid:

              FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the
         Trustee under Section 607;

              SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and
         unpaid upon the Debentures for principal (and premium,
         if any) and interest, in respect of which or for the
         benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably,
         without preference or priority of any kind, according to
         the amounts due and payable on such Debentures for
         principal (and premium, if any) and interest,
         respectively.

         SECTION 507.  Limitation on Suits.

         No Holder of any Debentures shall have any right to
    institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect
    to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or
    trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless

              (1)  such Holder has previously given written
         notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default;

              (2)  the Holders of not less than 25% in principal
         amount of the Outstanding Debentures shall have made
         written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings
         in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as
         Trustee hereunder;

              (3)  such Holder or Holders have offered to the
         Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs
         (including reasonable counsel fees), expenses and
         liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such
         request;

              (4)  the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of
         such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed
         to institute any such proceeding; and

              (5)  no direction inconsistent with such written
         request has been given to the Trustee during such 60 day
         period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount
         of the Outstanding Debentures;

    it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders
    of Debentures shall have any rights in any manner whatever by
    virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture
    to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other
    Holders of Debentures, or to obtain or to seek to obtain
    priority or preference over any other Holders or to enforce
    any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein
    provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the
    Holders of Debentures.

         SECTION 508.  Unconditional Right of Debentureholders to
    Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.

         Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture,
    the Holder of any Debenture shall have the right which is
    absolute and unconditional to receive payment of the
    principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section
    307) interest on such Debenture on the respective Stated
    Maturities expressed in such Debenture (or, in the case of
    redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for
    the enforcement of any such rights, and such rights shall not
    be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

          SECTION 509.  Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

         If the Trustee or any Debentureholder has instituted any
    proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this
    Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or
    abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to
    the Trustee or to such Debentureholder, then and in every
    such case the Company, the Trustee an the Debentureholders
    shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be
    restored severally and respectively to their former positions
    hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the
    Trustee an the Debentureholders shall continue as though no
    such proceeding had been instituted.

         SECTION 510.  Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

         No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to
    the Trustee or to the Debentureholders is intended to be
    exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and
    remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative
    and in addition to every other right and remedy given
    hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
    otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any right or
    remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the
    concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate
    right or remedy.

         SECTION 511.  Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

         No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of
    any Debenture to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon
    any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or
    constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an
    acquiescence therein.  Every right and remedy given by this
    Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Debentureholders
    may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be
    deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Debentureholders,
    as the case may be.

         SECTION 512.  Control by Debentureholders.

         The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
    Outstanding Debentures shall have the right to direct the
    time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
    remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or
    power conferred on the Trustee, provided that

              (1)  such direction shall not be in conflict with
         any rule of law or with this Indenture, and

              (2)  subject to the provisions of Section 601, the
         Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any
         such direction if the Trustee, being advised by counsel,
         determines that the action so directed may not lawfully
         be taken or may involve the Trustee in personal
         liability, or if the Trustee in good faith shall
         determine that the action so directed would be unjustly
         prejudicial to the Holders of the Debentures not taking
         part in such direction; and provided, further, that
         nothing in this Indenture contained shall impair the
         right of the Trustee in its discretion to take any
         action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not
         inconsistent with such direction by the Holders of
         Debentures.

         SECTION 513.  Waiver of Past Defaults.

         The Holders of not less than 66 2/3% in principal amount
    of the Outstanding Debentures may on behalf of the Holders of
    all the Debentures waive any past default hereunder and its
    consequences, except a default

              (1)  in the payment of the principal of (or
         premium, if any) or interest on any Debenture, or

              (2)  in respect of a covenant or provision hereof
         which under Article 900 cannot be modified or amended
         without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding
         Debenture affected.

         Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist,
    and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to
    have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no
    such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default
    or impair any right consequent thereon.

         SECTION 514.  Undertaking for Costs.

         All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of
    any Debenture by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to
    have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in
    any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
    this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any
    action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any
    part litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs
    of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion
    assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys'
    fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due
    regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses
    made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this
    Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the
    Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Debentureholder, or
    group of Debentureholders, holding in the aggregate more than
    10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Debentures, or to
    any suit instituted by any Debentureholder for the
    enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium,
    if any) or interest on any Debenture on or after the
    respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Debenture (or,
    in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).

         SECTION 515.  Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.

         The Company covenants (to the extent that it may
    lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or
    plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit
    or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted,
    now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the
    covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the
    Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby
    expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law,
    and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the
    execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but
    will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as
    though no such law had been enacted.

                              ARTICLE 600

                              THE TRUSTEE

         SECTION 601.  Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

         (a)  Except during the continuance of an Event of
    Default,

              (1)  the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties
         and only such duties as are specifically set forth in
         this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations
         shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee;
         and

              (2)  in the absence of bad faith on its part, the
         Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the
         statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed
         therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the
         Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this
         Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or
         opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically
         required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee
         shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine
         whether or not they conform to the requirements of this
         Indenture.

         (b)  In case an Event of Default has occurred and is
    continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and
    powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same
    degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man
    would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct
    of his own affairs.

         (c)  No provision of this Indenture shall be construed
    to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent
    action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own wilful
    misconduct, except that

              (1)  this Subsection shall not be construed to
         limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section;

              (2)  the Trustee shall not be liable for any error
         of judgement made in good faith by a Responsible
         Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was
         negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

              (3)  the Trustee shall not be liable with respect
         to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good
         faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of
         a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
         Debentures relating to the time, method and place of
         conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to
         the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred
         upon the Trustee, under this Indenture; and

              (4)  no provision of this Indenture shall require
         the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
         incur any financial liability in the performance of any
         of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of
         its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable
         grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or
         adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not
         reasonably assured to it.

         (d)  Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every
    provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or
    affecting the liability of or affording protection to the
    Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

         SECTION 602.  Notice of Defaults.

         Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default
    hereunder, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all
    Debentureholders, as their names and addresses appear in the
    Debenture Register, notice of such default hereunder known to
    the Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or
    waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a
    default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
    any) or interest on any Debenture, the Trustee shall be
    protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the
    board of directors, the executive committee or a trust
    committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of the
    Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such
    notice is in the interests of the Debentureholders; and
    provided, further, that in the case of any default of the
    character specified in Section 501(3) no such notice to
    Debentureholders shall be given until at least 30 days after
    the occurrence thereof.  For the purpose of this Section, the
    term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or
    lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default.

         SECTION 603.  Certain Rights of Trustee.

         Except as otherwise provided in Section 601:

         (1)  the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in
    acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
    certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
    request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture or other
    paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have
    been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

         (2)  any request or direction of the Company mentioned
    herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request
    or Company Order and any resolution of the Board of Directors
    may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution;

         (3)  whenever in the administration of this Indenture
    the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved
    or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any
    action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be
    herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad
    faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate;

         (4)  the Trustee may consult with counsel and the
    written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel
    shall be full and complete authorization and protection in
    respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it
    hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

         (5)  the Trustee shall be under no obligation to
    exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this
    Indenture at the request or direction of any of the
    Debentureholders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such
    Debentureholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable
    security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and
    liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with
    such request or direction;

         (6)  the Trustee shall not be bound to make any
    investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
    resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
    report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond,
    debenture or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its
    discretion may make such further inquiry or investigation
    into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the
    Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or
    investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books,
    records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent
    or attorney; and

         (7)  the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
    hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or
    by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not
    be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part
    of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it
    hereunder.

         SECTION 604.  Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance
    of Debentures.

         The recitals contained herein and in the Debentures,
    except the certificates of authentication, shall be taken as
    the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no
    responsibility for their correctness.  The Trustee makes no
    representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this
    Indenture or of the Debentures.  The Trustee shall not be
    accountable for the use or application by the Company of
    Debentures or the proceeds thereof.

         SECTION 605.  May Hold Debentures.

         The Trustee, any Paying Agent, Debenture Registrar or
    any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any
    other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Debentures
    and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, if operative, may
    otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would
    have if it were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Debenture
    Registrar or such other agent.

         SECTION 606.  Money Held in Trust.

         Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be
    segregated from other funds except to the extent required by
    law.  The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on
    any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed
    with the Company.

         SECTION 607.  Compensation and Reimbursement.

         The Company agrees

              (1)  to pay to the Trustee from time to time
         reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it
         hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by
         any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a
         trustee of an express trust);

              (2)  except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
         to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all
         reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred
         or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision
         of this Indenture including the reasonable compensation
         and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and
         counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or
         advances as may be attributable to its negligence or bad
         faith; and

              (3)  to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it
         harmless against, any loss, liability or expenses
         incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part,
         arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
         administration of this trust, including the costs and
         expenses of defending itself against any claim or
         liability in connection with the exercise or performance
         of any of its powers or duties hereunder.

         As security for the performance of the obligations of
    the Company under this Section the Trustee shall have a lien
    prior to the Debentures upon all property and funds held or
    collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust
    for the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or
    interest on Debentures.

         SECTION 608.  Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.

         (a)  If the Trustee has or shall acquire any conflicting
    interest, as defined in this Section, it shall, within 90
    days after ascertaining that it has such conflicting
    interest, either eliminate such conflicting interest or
    resign in the manner and with the effect hereinafter
    specified in this Article.

         (b)  In the event that the Trustee shall fail to comply
    with the provisions of Subsection (a) of this Section the
    Trustee shall, within 10 days after the expiration of such
    90-day period, transmit by mail to all Debentureholders, as
    their names and addresses appear in the Debenture Register,
    notice of such failure.

         (c)  For the purposes of this Section, the Trustee shall
    be deemed to have a conflicting interest if

              (1)  the Trustee is trustee under another indenture
         under which any other securities, or certificates of
         interest or participation in any other securities, of
         the Company are outstanding, unless such other indenture
         is a collateral trust indenture under which the only
         collateral consists of Debentures issued under this
         Indenture, provided that there shall be excluded from
         the operation of this paragraph any indenture or
         indentures under which other securities, or certificates
         of interest or participation in other securities, of the
         Company are outstanding, if

                   (i)  this Indenture and such other indenture
              or indentures are wholly unsecured and such other
              indenture or indentures are hereafter qualified
              under TIA, as then in force, unless the Commission
              shall have found and declared by order pursuant to
              Section 305(b) or Section 307(c) of TIA that
              differences exist between the provisions of this
              Indenture and the provisions of such other
              indenture or indentures which are so likely to
              involve a material conflict of interest as to make
              it necessary in the public interest or for the
              protection of investors to disqualify the Trustee
              from acting as such under this Indenture and such
              other indenture or indentures, or

                   (ii)  the Company shall have sustained the
              burden of proving, on application to the Commission
              and after opportunity for hearing thereon, that
              trusteeship under this Indenture and such other
              indenture or indentures is not so likely to involve
              a material conflict of interest as to make it
              necessary in the public interest or for the
              protection of investors to disqualify the Trustee
              from acting as such under one of such indentures;

              (2)  the Trustee or any of its directors or
         executive officers is an obligor upon the Debentures or
         an underwriter for the Company;

              (3)  the Trustee directly or indirectly controls or

              (4)  the Trustee or any of its directors or
         executive officers is a director, officer, partner,

         of an underwriter (other than the Trustee itself) for
         the Company who is currently engaged in the business of
         underwriting, except that (i) one individual may be a
         director or an executive officer, or both, of the
         Trustee and a director or an executive officer, or both,
         of the Company but may not be at the same time an
         executive officer of both the Trustee and the Company;
         (ii) if and so long as the number of directors of the
         Trustee in office is more than nine, one additional
         individual may be a director or an executive officer, or
         both, of the Trustee and a director of the Company; and
         (iii) the Trustee may be designated by the Company or by
         any underwriter for the Company to act in the capacity
         of transfer agent, registrar, custodian, paying agent,

         other similar capacity, or, subject to the provisions of
         paragraph (1) of this Subsection, to act as trustee,
         whether under an indenture or otherwise;

              (5)  10% or more of the voting securities of the
         Trustee is beneficially owned either by the Company or
         by any director, partner, or executive officer thereof,
         or 20% or more of such voting securities is beneficially

         thereof, or is beneficially owned, collectively, by any
         two or more such persons;

              (6)  the Trustee is the beneficial owner of, or
         holds as collateral security for an obligation which is
         in default (as hereinafter in this Subsection defined),
         (i) 5% or more of the voting securities, or 10% or more
         of any other class of security of the Company not
         including the Debentures issued under this Indenture and
         securities issued under any other indenture under

         or is under direct or indirect common control with, the
         Company;

              (8)  the Trustee is the beneficial owner of, or
         holds as collateral security for an obligation which is
         in default (as hereinafter in this Subsection defined),
         10% or more of any class of security of any person who,
         to the knowledge of the Trustee, owns 50% or more of the
         voting securities of the Company; or

              (9)  the Trustee owns, on May 15 in any calendar
         year, in the capacity of executor, administrator,
         testamentary or inter vivos trustee, guardian, committee
         or conservator, or in any other similar capacity, an
         aggregate of 25% or more of the voting securities, or of
         any class of security, of any person, the beneficial
         ownership of a specified percentage of which would have
         constituted a conflicting interest under paragraphs (6),
         (7) or (8) of this Subsection.  As to any such
         securities of which the Trustee acquired ownership
         through becoming executor, administrator, or
         testamentary trustee of an estate which included them,
         the provisions of the preceding sentence shall not
         apply, for a period of two years from the date of such
         acquisition, to the extent that such securities included
         in such estate do not exceed 25% of such voting
         securities or 25% of any such class of security.
         Promptly after May 15 in each calendar year, the Trustee
         shall make a check of its holdings of such securities in
         any of the above-mentioned capacities as of such May 15.
         If the Company fails to make payment in full of the
         principal of, or the premium , if any, or interest on,
         any of the Debentures when and as the same becomes due
         and payable, and such failure continues for 30 days
         thereafter, the Trustee shall make a prompt check of its
         holdings of such securities in any of the
         above-mentioned capacities as of the date of the
         expiration os such 30 day period, and after such date,
         notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
         paragraph, all such securities so held by the Trustee,
         with sole or joint control over such securities vested
         in it, shall, but only so long as such failure shall
         continue, be considered as though beneficially owned by
         the Trustee for the purposes of paragraphs (6), (7) and
         (8) of this Subsection.

         The specification of percentages in paragraphs (5) to
    (9) inclusive, of this Subsection, shall not be construed as
    indicating that the ownership of such percentages of the
    securities of a person is or is not necessary or sufficient
    to constitute direct or indirect control for the purposes of
    paragraph (3) or (7) of this Subsection.

         For the purposes of paragraphs (6), (7), (8) and (9) of
    this Subsection only, (i) the terms "security" and
    "securities" shall include only such securities as are
    generally known as corporate securities, but shall not
    include any note or other evidence of indebtedness issued to
    evidence an obligation to repay monies lent to a person by
    one or more banks, trust companies or banking firms, or any
    certificate of interest or participation in any such note or
    evidence of indebtedness; (ii) an obligation shall be deemed
    to be "in default" when a default in payment of principal
    shall have continued for 30 days or more and shall not have
    been cured; and (iii) the Trustee shall not be deemed to be
    the owner or holder of (A) any security which it holds as
    collateral security, as trustee or otherwise, for an
    obligation which is not in default as defined in clause (ii)
    above, or (B) any security which it holds as collateral
    security under this Indenture, irrespective of any default
    hereunder, or (C) any security which it holds as agent for
    collection, or as custodian, escrow agent, or depositary, or
    in any similar representative capacity.

              (1)  The term "underwriter" when used with
         reference to the Company means every person who, within

         determination is made, has purchased from the Company
         with a view to, or has offered or sold for the Company
         in connection with, the distribution of any security of
         the Company outstanding at such time, or has
         participated or has had a direct or indirect
         participation in any such undertaking, or has
         participated or has had a participation in the direct or
         indirect underwriting of any such undertaking, but such
         term shall not include a person whose interest was
         limited to a commission from an underwriter or dealer

         or sellers' commission.

              (2)  The term "director" means any director of a

         shall include only a trust where the interest or
         interests of the beneficiary or beneficiaries are
         evidenced by a security.

              (4)  The term "voting security" means any security
         presently entitling the owner or holder thereof to vote
         in the direction or management of the affairs of a
         person, or any security issued under or pursuant to any
         trust, agreement or arrangement whereby a trustee or
         trustees or agent or agents for the owner or holder of
         such security are presently entitled to vote in the
         direction or management of the affairs of a person.

         Debentures.

         (e)  The percentages of voting securities and other

              (1)  A specified percentage of the voting
         securities of the Trustee, the Company or any other
         person referred to in this Section (each of whom is
         referred to as a "person" in this paragraph) means such
         amount of the outstanding voting securities of such
         person as entitles the holder or holders thereof to cast
         such specified percentage of the aggregate votes which
         the holders of all the outstanding voting securities of
         such person are entitled to cast in the direction or
         management of the affairs of such person.

              (2)  A specified percentage of a class of
         securities of a person means such percentage of the

         held by or for the account of the issuer.  The following
         securities shall not be deemed outstanding within the
         meaning of this definition:

                   (i)  securities of an issuer held in a sinking
              fund relating to securities of the issuer of the
              same class;

                   (ii)  securities of an issuer held in a
              sinking fund relating to another class of
              securities of the issuer, if the obligation
              evidenced by such other class of securities is not
              in default as to principal or interest or
              otherwise;

                   (iii)  securities pledged by the issuer
              thereof as security for an obligation of the issuer
              not in default as to principal or interest or

                   (iv)  securities held in escrow if placed in
              escrow by the issuer thereof.

         provided, however, that any voting securities of an
         issuer shall be deemed outstanding if any person other
         than the issuer is entitled to exercise the voting
         rights thereof.

              (5)  A security shall be deemed to be of the same
         class as another security if both securities confer upon
         the holder or holders thereof substantially the same
         rights and privileges; provided, however, that, in the
         case of secured evidences of indebtedness, all of which
         are issued under a single indenture, differences in the
         interest rates or maturity dates of various series
         thereof shall not be deemed sufficient to constitute
         such series different classes and provided, further,
         that, in the case of unsecured evidences of
         indebtedness, differences in the interest rates or
         maturity dates thereof shall not be deemed sufficient to
         constitute them securities of different classes, whether
         or not they are issued under a single indenture.

         SECTION 609.  Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.

         There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which
    shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the
    laws of the United States of America or of any State,
    authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust
    powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least
    $5,000,000, subject to supervision or examination by Federal
    or State authority.  If such corporation publishes reports of
    condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the
    requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining
    authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the
    combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be
    deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in
    its most recent report of condition so published.  If at any
    time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance
    with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign
    immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter
    specified in this Article.

         SECTION 610.  Resignation and Removal; Appointment of
    Successor.

         (a)  No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no
    appointment of a succesor Trustee pursuant to this Article
    shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
    the successor Trustee under Section 611.

         (b)  the Trustee may resign at any time by giving
    written notice thereof to the Company.  If an instrument of
    acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been
    delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of
    such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may
    petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
    appointment of a successor Trustee.

         (c)  The Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of
    the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
    Outstanding Debentures, delivered to the Trustee and to the
    Company.

         (d)  If at any time:

              (1)  the Trustee, after this Indenture shall have
         been qualified under TIA, shall fail to comply with
         Section 608(a) after written request therefor by the
         Company or by any Debentureholder who has been a bona
         fide Holder of a Debenture for at least 6 months, or

              (2)  the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under
         Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written
         request therefor by the Company or by any such
         Debentureholder, or

              (3)  the Trustee shall become incapable of acting
         or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a
         receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be
         appointed or any public officer shall take charge or
         control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for
         the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
         liquidation.

    then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution
    may remove the Trustee, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any
    Debentureholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
    Debenture for at least 6 months may, on behalf of himself and
    all others similarly situated, petition any court of
    competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the
    appointment of a successor Trustee.

         (e)  If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become
    incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the
    office of Trustee for any cause, the Company, by a Board
    Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.  If,
    within 1 year after such resignation, removal or
    incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor
    Trustee shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a
    majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debentures
    delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the
    successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its
    acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Trustee
    and supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. 
    If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed by the
    Company or the Debentureholders and accepted appointment in
    the manner hereinafter provided, any Debentureholder who has
    been a bona fide Holder of a Debenture for at least 6 months
    may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,
    petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
    appointment of a successor Trustee.

         (f)  The Company shall give notice of each resignation
    and each removal of the Trustee and each appointment of a
    successor Trustee by mailing written notice of such event by
    first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of
    Debentures as their names and addresses appear in the
    Debenture Register.  Each notice shall include the name of
    the successor Trustee and the address of its principal
    corporate trust office.

         SECTION 611.  Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.

         Every successor Trustee appointed hereunder shall
    execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the
    retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment,
    and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring
    Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
    without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become
    vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the
    retiring Trustee; but, on request of the Company or the
    successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment
    of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument
    transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers
    and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign,
    transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property
    and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject
    nevertheless to its lien, if any, provided for in Section
    607.  Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company
    shall execute any and all instruments for more full and
    certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee
    all such rights, powers and trusts.

         No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless
    at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall
    be qualified and eligible under this Article, to the extent
    operative.

         SECTION 612.  Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or
    Succession to Business.

         Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or
    converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
    corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
    consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
    corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the
    corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the
    successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation
    shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article,
    to the extent operative, without the execution or filing of
    any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
    parties hereto.  In case any Debentures shall have been
    authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in
    office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation
    to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication
    and deliver the Debentures so authenticated with the same
    effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated
    such Debentures.

         SECTION 613.  Preferential Collection of Claims against
    Company.

         (a)  Subject to Subsection (b) of this Section, if the
    Trustee shall be or shall become a creditor, directly or
    indirectly, secured or unsecured, of the Company within 4
    months prior to a default, as defined in Subsection (c) of
    this Section, or subsequent to such a default, then, unless
    and until such default shall be cured, the Trustee shall set
    apart, and hold in a special account for the benefit of the
    Trustee individually, the Holders of the Debentures and the
    holders of other indenture securities (as defined in
    Subsection (c) of the Section):

              (1)  an amount equal to any and all reductions in
         the amount due and owing upon any claim as such creditor
         in respect of principal or interest, effected after the
         beginning of such 4 months period and valid as against
         the Company and its other creditors, except any such
         reduction resulting from the receipt or disposition of
         any property described in paragraph (2) of this
         Subsection, or from the exercise of any right of set-off
         which the Trustee could have exercised if a petition in
         bankruptcy had been filed by or against the Company upon
         the date of such default; and

              (2)  all property received by the Trustee in
         respect of any claim as such creditor, either as
         security therefor, or in satisfaction or composition
         thereof, or otherwise, after the beginning of such 4
         months period, or an amount equal to the proceeds of any
         such property, if disposed of, subject, however, to the
         rights, if any, of the Company and its other creditors
         in such property or such proceeds.

    Nothing herein contained, however, shall affect the right of
    the Trustee

              (A)  to retain for its own account (i) payments
         made on account of any such claim by any Person (other
         than the Company) who is liable thereon, and (ii) the
         proceeds of the bona fide sale of any such claim by the
         Trustee to a third person, and (iii) distributions made
         in cash, securities or other property in respect of
         claims filed against the Company in bankruptcy or
         receivership or in proceedings for reorganization
         pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Act or applicable
         State law;

              (B)  to realize, for its own account, upon any
         property held by it as security for any such claim, if
         such property was so held prior to the beginning of such
         4 months period;

              (C)  to realize, for its own account, but only to
         the extent of the claim hereinafter mentioned, upon any
         property held by it as security for any such claim, if
         such claim was created after the beginning of such 4
         months period and such property was received as security
         therefor simultaneously with the creation thereof, and
         if the Trustee shall sustain the burden of proving that
         at the time such property was so received the Trustee
         had no reasonable cause to believe that a default as
         defined in Subsection (c) of this Section would occur
         within 4 months; or

              (D)  to receive payment on any claim referred to in
         paragraph (B) or (C), against the release of any
         property held as security for such claims as provided in
         paragraph (B) or (C), as the case may be, to the extent
         of the fair value of such property.

         For the purposes of paragraphs (B), (C) and (D),
    property substituted after the beginning of such 4 months
    period for property held as security at the time of such
    substitution shall, to the extent of the fair value of the
    property released, have the same status as the property
    released, and, to the extent that any claim referred to in
    any of such paragraphs is created in renewal of or in
    substitution for or for the purpose of repaying or refunding
    any pre-existing claim of the Trustee as such creditor, such
    claim shall have the same status as such pre-existing claim.

         If the Trustee hall be required to account, the funds
    and property held in such special account and the proceeds
    thereof shall be apportioned between the Trustee, the
    Debentureholders and the holders of other indenture
    securities in such manner that the Trustee, the
    Debentureholders and the holders of other indenture
    securities realize, as a result of payments from such special
    account and payments of dividends on claims filed against the
    Company in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for
    reorganization pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Act or
    applicable State law, the same percentage of their respective
    claims, figured before crediting to the claim of the Trustee
    anything on account of the receipt by it from the Company of
    the funds and property in such special account and before
    crediting to the respective claims of the Trustee and the
    Debentureholders and the holders of other indenture
    securities dividends on claims filed against the Company in
    bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for
    reorganization pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Act or
    applicable State law, but after crediting thereon receipts on
    account of the indebtedness represented by their respective
    claims from all sources other than from such dividends and
    from the funds and property so held in such special account.
    As used in this paragraph, with respect to any claim, the
    term "dividends" shall include any distribution with respect
    to such claim, in bankruptcy or receivership or proceedings
    for reorganization pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Act or
    applicable State law, whether such distribution is made in
    cash, securities, or other property, but shall not include
    any such distribution with respect to the secure portion, if
    any, of such claim.  The court in which such bankruptcy,
    receivership or proceedings for reorganization is pending
    shall have jurisdiction (i) to apportion between the Trustee
    and the Debentureholders and the holders of other indenture
    securities, in accordance with the provisions of this
    paragraph, the funds and property held in such special
    account and proceeds thereof, or (ii) in lieu of such
    apportionment, in whole or in part, to give to the provisions
    of this paragraph due consideration in determining the
    fairness of the distributions to be made to the Trustee and
    the Debentureholders and the holders of other indenture
    securities with respect to their respective claims, in which
    event it shall not be necessary to liquidate or to appraise
    the value of any securities or other property held in such
    special account or as security for any such claim, or to make
    a specific allocation of such distributions as between the
    secured and unsecured portions of such claims, or otherwise
    to apply the provisions of this paragraph as a mathematical
    formula.

         Any Trustee which has resigned or been removed after the
    beginning of such 4 months period shall be subject to the
    provisions of this Subsection as though such resignation or
    removal had not occurred.  If any Trustee has resigned or
    been removed prior to the beginning of such 4 months period,
    it shall be subject to the provisions of this Subsection if
    and only if the following conditions exist:

              (i)  the receipt of property or reduction of claim,
         which would have given rise to the obligation to
         account, if such Trustee had continued as Trustee,
         occurred after the beginning of such 4 months period;
         and

              (ii)  such receipt of property or reduction of
         claim occurred with 4 months after such resignation or
         removal.

         (b)  There shall be excluded from the operation of
    Subsection (a) of this Section a creditor relationship
    arising from

              (1)  the ownership or acquisition of securities
         issued under any indenture, or any security or
         securities having a maturity of one year or more at the
         time of acquisition by the Trustee;

              (2)  advances authorized by a receivership or
         bankruptcy court of competent jurisdiction, or by this
         Indenture, for the purpose of preserving any property
         which shall at any time be subject to the lien of this
         Indenture or of discharging tax liens or other prior
         liens or encumbrances thereon, if notice of such
         advances and of the circumstances surrounding the making
         thereof is given to the Debenture holders at the time
         and in the manner provided in this Indenture;

              (3)  disbursements made in the ordinary course of
         business in the capacity of trustee under an indenture,
         transfer agent, registrar, custodian, paying agent,
         fiscal agent or depositary, or other similar capacity;

              (4)  an indebtedness created as a result of
         services rendered or premises rented; or an indebtedness
         created as a result of goods or securities sold in a
         cash transaction as defined in Subsection (c) of this
         Section;

              (5)  the ownership of stock or of other securities
         of a corporation organized under the provisions of
         Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended,
         which is directly or indirectly a creditor of the
         Company; or

              (6)  the acquisition, ownership, acceptance or
         negotiation of any drafts, bills of exchange,
         acceptances or obligations which fall within the
         classification of self-liquidating paper as defined in
         Subsection (c) of this Section.

         (c)  For the purposes of this Section only:

              (1)  The term "default" means any failure to make
         payment in full of the principal or of interest on any
         of the Debentures or upon the other indenture securities
         when and as such principal or interest becomes due and
         payable.

              (2)  The term "other indenture securities" means
         securities upon which the Company is an obligor
         outstanding under any other indenture (i) under which
         the Trustee is also trustee, (ii) which contains
         provisions substantially similar to the provisions of
         this Section, and (iii) under which a default exists at
         the time of the apportionment of the funds and property
         held in such special account.

              (3)  The term "cash transaction" means any
         transaction in which full payment for goods or
         securities sold is made within 7 days after delivery of
         the goods or securities in currency or in checks or
         other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable
         upon demand.

              (4)  The term "self-liquidating paper" means any
         draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation which
         is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred by the Company
         for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing,
         manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares
         or merchandise and which is secured by documents
         evidencing title to, possession of, or a lien upon, the
         goods, wares or merchandise or the receivables or
         proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or
         merchandise previously constituting the security,
         provided the security is received by the Trustee
         simultaneously with the creation of the creditor
         relationship with the Company arising from the making,
         drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill
         of exchange, acceptance or obligation.

              (5)  The term "Company" means any obligor upon the
         Debentures.

         SECTION 614.  Appointment of Authenticating Agent.

         At any time when any of the Debentures remain
    Outstanding, the Trustee will appoint an Authenticating Agent
    in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, which
    shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to
    authenticate Debentures issued upon exchange, transfer or
    partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and
    Debentures so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits
    of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all
    purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. 
    Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the
    authentication and delivery of Debentures by the Trustee or
    the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference
    shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on
    behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a
    certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the
    Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.  Each Authenticating
    Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all
    times be a corporation organized and doing business under the
    laws of the United States of America or of any State,
    authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent,
    having a combined capital and surplus of not less than
    $1,500,000 and subject to supervision or examination by
    Federal or State authorities.  If such corporation publishes
    reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to
    the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining
    authority, then for the purposes of this Section 614, the
    combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be
    deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in
    its most recent report of condition so published.  In case at
    any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible
    in accordance with the provisions of this Section 614, such
    Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner
    and with the effect specified in this Section 614.

         The Trustee hereby initially appoints The Chase
    Manhattan Bank (National Association) as its Authenticating
    Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.

         Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may
    be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated,
    or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
    consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a
    party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency
    or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall
    continue to be an Authenticating Agent without the execution
    or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the
    Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

         An Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving
    written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the
    Company.  The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of
    an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of
    termination to such authenticating Agent an to the Company. 
    Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a
    termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent
    shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions
    of this Section 614, the Trustee promptly shall appoint a
    successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to
    the Company and shall mail notice of such appointment to all
    Holders, as their names and addresses appear on the Debenture
    Register.  Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance
    of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the
    rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with
    like effect as if originally named as an authenticating Agent
    herein.  No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed
    unless eligible under the provisions of this Section 614.

         The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent
    from time to time reasonable compensation for its services
    under this Section 614, and the Trustee shall be entitled to
    be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of
    Section 607.

                             ARTICLE 700

       DEBENTUREHOLDERS' LISTS AND REPORTS BY TRUSTEE AND COMPANY

         SECTION 701.  Company to Furnish Trustee Names and
    Addresses of Debentureholders.

         The Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the
    Trustee

              (a)  semi-annually, not more than 15 days after
         each Regular Record Date, a list, in such form as the
         Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and
         addresses of the Holders of Debentures as of such
         Regular Record Date, and

              (b)  at such other times as the Trustee may request
         in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the
         Company of any such request, a list of similar form and
         content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the
         time such list is furnished.

    provided, however, so long as the Trustee is the Debenture
    Registrar, no such list need be furnished.

         SECTION 702.  Preservation of Information;
    Communications to Debentureholders.

         (a)  The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as
    is reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Holders
    of Debentures contained in the most recent list furnished to
    the Trustee as provided in Section 701 and the names and
    addresses of Holders of Debentures received by the Trustee in
    its capacity as Debenture Registrar.  The Trustee may destroy
    any list furnished to it as provided in Section 701 upon
    receipt of a new list so furnished.

         (b)  If 3 or more Holders of Debentures (hereinafter
    referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee,
    and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof that each such
    applicant has owned a Debenture for a period of at least six
    months preceding the date of such application, and such
    application states that the applicants desire to communicate
    with other Holders of Debentures with respect to their rights
    under this Indenture or under the Debentures and is
    accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other
    communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then
    the Trustee shall, within five business days after the
    receipt of such application, at its election, either

              (1)  afford such applicants access to the
         information preserved at the time by the Trustee in
         accordance with Section 702(a), or

              (2)  inform such applicants as to the approximate
         number of Holders of Debentures whose names and
         addresses appear in the information preserved at the
         time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 702(a),
         and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such
         Debentureholders the form of proxy or other
         communication, if any, specified in such application.

         If the Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants
    access to such information, the Trustee shall, upon the
    written request of such applicants, mail to each
    Debentureholder whose name and address appear in the
    information preserved at the time by the Trustee in
    accordance with Section 702(a), a copy of the form of proxy
    or other communication which is specified in such request,
    with reasonable promptness after a tender to the Trustee of
    the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for
    the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless
    within five days after such tender, the Trustee shall mail to
    such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a
    copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the
    effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee, such mailing
    would be contrary to the best interests of the Holders of
    Debentures or would be in violation of applicable law.  Such
    written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. 
    If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the
    objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall
    enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or
    if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of
    such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and
    opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained
    have been met and shall enter an order so declaring, the
    Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such
    Debentureholders with reasonable promptness after the entry
    of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise the
    Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such
    applicants respecting their application.

         (c)  Every Holder of debentures, by receiving and
    holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee
    that neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be held
    accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such
    information as to the names and addresses of the Holders of
    Debentures in accordance with Section 702(b), regardless of
    the source from which such information was derived, and that
    the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of
    mailing any material pursuant to a request made under Section
    702(b).

         SECTION 703.  Reports by Trustee.

         (a)  The term "reporting date", as used in this Section,
    means June 30 in each year commencing with June 30, 1975.

         qualifications under Section 608, or in lieu thereof, if

         eligible and qualified under said Sections, a written
         statement to such effect;

              (2)  the character and amount of any advances (and

         and for the reimbursement of which it claims or may
         claim a lien or charge, prior to that of the Debentures,
         on any property or funds held or collected by it as
         Trustee, except that the Trustee shall not be required
         (but may elect) to report such advances if such advances
         so remaining unpaid aggregate not more than - of 1% of

         the date of such report;

              (3)  the amount, interest rate and maturity date of
         all other indebtedness owing by the Company (or by any
         other obligor on the Debentures) to the Trustee in its
         individual capacity, on the date of such report, with a
         brief description of any property held as collateral
         security therefor, except an indebtedness based upon a
         creditor relationship arising in any manner described in
         Section 613(b)(2), (3), (4) or (6);

              (4)  the property and funds, if any, physically
         in the possession of the Trustee as such on the date of
         such report;

              (5)  any additional issue of Debentures which the
         Trustee has not previously reported; and

              (6)  any action taken by the Trustee in the
         performance of its duties hereunder which it has
         not previously reported and which in its opinion
         materially affects the Debentures, except action in
         respect of a default, notice of which has been or is to
         be withheld by the Trustee in accordance with Section
         602.

         (b)  The Trustee shall transmit by mail to all
    Debentureholders, as their names and addresses appear in the
    Debenture Register, a brief report with respect to the
    character and amount of any advances (and if the Trustee
    elects so to state, the circumstances surrounding he making
    hereof) made by the Trustee (as such) since the date of the
    last report transmitted pursuant to Subsection (a) of this
    Section (or if no such report has yet been so transmitted,

    reimbursement of which it claims or may claim a lien or
    charge, prior to that of the Debentures, on property or funds
    held or collected by it as Trustee, and which it has not
    previously reported pursuant to this Subsection, except that
    the Trustee shall not be required (but may elect) to report
    such advances if such advances remaining unpaid at any time
    aggregate 10% or less of the principal amount of the
    Debentures Outstanding at such time, such report to be
    transmitted within 90 days after such time.

         (c)  A copy of each such report shall, at the time of
    such transmission to Debentureholders, to be filed by the
    Trustee with each stock exchange upon which the Debentures
    are listed, and also with the Commission.  The Company will

         or reports pursuant to either of said Sections, then it
         will file with the Trustee and the Commission, in

         time to time by the Commission, such of the
         supplementary and periodic information, documents and

         rules and regulations;

              (2)  file with the Trustee and the Commission, in
         accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from
         time to time by the Commission, such additional

    and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under
    this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor
    corporation had been named as the Company herein; provided,
    however, that no such conveyance or transfer shall have the

         any other provisions with respect to matters or
         questions arising under this Indenture which shall not
         be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture,
         provided such action shall not adversely affect the
         interest of the Holders of the Debentures; or

              (4)  to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions
         of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary
         to effect the qualification of this Indenture under TIA,
         as then in force, or under any similar federal statute
         hereafter enacted, and to add to this Indenture such
         other provisions as may be expressly permitted by TIA,
         excluding however, the provisions referred to in Section

         similar federal statute hereafter enacted.

         SECTION 902.  Supplemental Indentures With Consent of
    Debentureholders.

         With the consent of the Holders of not less than 66 2/3%

    to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the
    provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner

    Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental
    indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each
    Outstanding Debenture affected thereby,

              (1)  change the Stated Maturity of the Principal
         of, or any instalment of interest on, any Debenture, or

              (2)  reduce the percentage in principal amount of

         It shall not be necessary for any Act of
    Debentureholders under this Section to approve the particular
    form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be
    sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.

         SECTION 903.  Execution of Supplemental Indentures.

         In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created
    by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or

    upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of
    such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by
    this Indenture.  The Trustee may, but shall not (except to

    entered into under Section 901(4) be obligated to, enter into

    Indentures.

         Debentures authenticated and delivered after the
    execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this
    Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a
    notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter
    provided for in such supplemental indenture.  If the Company
    shall so determine, new Debentures so modified as to conform,
    in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to
    any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed
    by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee
    in exchange for Outstanding Debentures.

         SECTION 907.  Officers' Certificate With Respect to
    Supplemental Indentures.

                        ARTICLE 1000

                          COVENANTS

         SECTION 1001.  Payment of Principal, Premium and
    Interest.

         The Company will duly and punctually pay the principal
    of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debentures in
    accordance with the terms of the Debentures and this
    Indenture.

         SECTION 1002.  Maintenance of Office or Agency.

         The Company will maintain an office or agency in the
    Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, where
    Debentures may be presented or surrendered for payment, where
    Debentures may be surrendered for registration of transfer or
    exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company
    in respect of the Debentures and this Indenture may be
    served.  The Company initially appoints The Chase Manhattan
    Bank (National Association) as agent for such purposes.  The
    Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the
    location, and of any change in the location, of such office
    or agency.  If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain
    such office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee
    with the address thereof, such presentation, surrenders,
    notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate
    Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints
    the Trustee its agent to receive all such presentations,
    surrenders, notices and demands.

         SECTION 1003.  Money for Debenture Payments to be Held
    in Trust.

         If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying
    Agent, it will, on or before each due date of the principal
    of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the
    Debentures, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of
    the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the
    principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due
    until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise
    disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the
    Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

         Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying
    Agents, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of
    (and premium, if any) or interest on, any Debentures, deposit
    with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal
    (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum
    to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
    to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such
    Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify
    the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

         The Company will cause each Paying Agent other than the
    Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument
    in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee,
    subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying
    Agent will

              (1)  hold all sums held by it for the payment of
         principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on
         Debentures in trust for the benefit of the Persons
         entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such
         Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

              (2)  give the Trustee notice of any default by the
         Company (or any other obligor upon the Debentures) in
         the making of any such payment of principal (and
         premium, if any) or interest; and

              (3)  at any time during the continuance of any such
         default, upon the written request of the Trustee,
         forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust
         by such Paying Agent.

         The Company may at any time, for the purpose of
    obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or
    for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any
    Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by
    the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the
    Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums
    were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such
    payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent
    shall be released from all further liability with respect to
    such money.

         Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying
    Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment
    of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any
    Debenture and remaining unclaimed for 6 years after such
    principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due
    and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request,
    or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from
    such trust; and the Holder of such Debenture shall
    thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to
    the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the
    Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust
    money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof,
    shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or
    such Paying Agent, before being require to make any such
    repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be
    published once, in an Authorized Newspaper in the Place of
    Payment, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that,
    after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than
    30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed
    balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the
    Company.

         SECTION 1004.  Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

         The Company will, and will cause each Subsidiary to, pay
    or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the
    same shall become delinquent; (1) all taxes, assessments and
    governmental charges levied or imposed upon it or upon its
    income, profits or property, and (2) all lawful claims for
    labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law
    become a lien upon its property; provided, however, that
    neither the Company nor any Subsidiary be required to pay or
    discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax,
    assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or
    validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate
    proceedings.

         SECTION 1005.  Maintenance of Properties.

         The Company will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
    cause all its properties used or useful in the conduct of its
    business to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair
    and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment
    and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals,
    replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in
    the judgment of the Company may be necessary so that the
    business carried on in connection therewith may be properly
    and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however,
    that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from
    discontinuing the operation and maintenance of any of its
    properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the
    Company, desirable in the conduct of its business and not
    disadvantageous in any material respect to the
    Debentureholders.

         SECTION 1006.  Statement as to Compliance.

         The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days
    after the end of each fiscal year commencing with the fiscal
    year ending June 30, 1975, a written statement signed by the
    Chairman of the Board or President or a Vice President and by
    the Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer, the Controller or an
    Assistant Controller of the Company, stating, as to each
    signer thereof, that

              (1)  a review of the activities of the Company
         during such year and of performance under this Indenture
         has been made under his supervision and

              (2)  to the best of his knowledge, based on such
         review, the Company has fulfilled all its obligations
         under this Indenture throughout such year, or, if there
         has been a default in the fulfillment of any such
         obligation, specifying each such default known to him
         and the nature and status thereof.

         SECTION 1007.  Corporate Existence.

         Subject to Article 800, the Company will, and will cause
    each Subsidiary to, do or cause to be done all things
    necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its
    corporate existence, rights (charter and statutory) and
    franchise; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
    required to preserve any right or franchise if the Board of
    Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no
    longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the
    Company or such Subsidiary and that the loss thereof is not
    disadvantageous in any material respect to the
    Debentureholders.

         SECTION 1008.  Restrictions on Merger, Sale of Assets,
    etc.

         The Company will not sell or transfer its property as an
    entirety or substantially as an entirety, or consolidate with
    or merge into any other corporation, or permit any other
    corporation to merge into it, in any manner which is
    prohibited by Article 800.

                           ARTICLE 1100

                      REDEMPTION OF DEBENTURES

         SECTION 1101.  Right of Redemption.

         The Company may, at its option, redeem all or any part
    of the Debentures at any time on and after July 1, 1976 and
    prior to Maturity by payment of the applicable percentages of
    the principal amount thereof set forth in the form of
    Debenture contained in Section 202 hereof, together with
    accrued interest to the Redemption Date.

         SECTION 1102.  Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.

         The determination of the Company to exercise its option
    to redeem any Debentures shall be evidenced by a Board
    Resolution.  In case of any redemption at the option of the
    Company of less than all of the Debentures, the Company
    shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by
    the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to
    the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and
    of the principal amount of Debentures to be redeemed.

         SECTION 1103.  Selection by Trustee of Debentures to be
    Redeemed.

         If less than all the Debentures are to be redeemed, the
    particular Debentures or portions thereof to be redeemed
    shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the
    Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding
    Debentures not previously called for redemption, by such
    method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and
    which may provide for the selection for redemption of
    portions of the principal of Debentures of a denomination
    larger than $1,000.  The portions of the principal of
    Debentures so selected for partial redemption shall be equal
    to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof.

         The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing
    of the Debentures selected for redemption and, in the case of
    any Debenture selected for partial redemption, the principal
    amount thereof to be redeemed.

         For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context
    otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption
    of Debentures shall relate, in the case of any Debenture
    redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of
    the principal of such Debenture which has been or is to be
    redeemed.

         Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail,
    postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60
    days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of
    Debentures to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the
    Debenture Register.

         All notices of redemption shall state:

              (1)  the Redemption Date,

              (2)  the Redemption Price,

         partial redemption, the respective principal amounts) of
         the Debentures to be redeemed.

              (4)  that on the Redemption Date the Redemption
         Price will become due and payable upon each such
         Debenture, together with interest accrued thereon to
         such date, and that interest thereon shall cease to
         accrue from and after said date, and

              (5)  the place where such Debentures are to be
         surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, which
         shall be the office or agency of the Company in each
         Place of Payment.

         Notice of redemption of Debentures shall be given by the
    Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the
    name and at the expense of the Company.

         SECTION 1105.  Deposit of Redemption Price.

         Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit
    with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company
    is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in
    trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money
    sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued
    interest, if any, on all the Debentures which are to be
    redeemed on that date.

         SECTION 1106.  Debentures Payable on Redemption Date.

         Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the
    Debentures so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date,
    become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein
    specified and on and after such date (unless the Company
    shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and
    accrued interest, if any) such Debentures shall cease to bear
    interest.  Upon surrender of such Debentures for redemption
    in accordance with said notice, such Debentures shall be paid
    by the Company at the Redemption Price.  Instalments of
    interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the
    Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such
    Debentures registered as such on the relevant Record Dates
    according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.

         SECTION 1107.  Debentures Redeemed in Part.

         Any Debenture which is to be redeemed only in part shall
    be surrendered at a Place of Payment (with, if the Company or
    the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written
    instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company
    and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his
    attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall
    execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the
    Holder of such Debenture, without service charge, a new
    Debenture or Debentures, of any authorized denomination as
    requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal
    to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the
    principal of the Debenture so surrendered.

                    SUBORDINATION OF DEBENTURES

         SECTION 1201.  Debentures Subordinate to Superior Debt.

         The Company, for itself, its successors and assigns,
    covenants and agrees, and each Holder of Debentures, by his
    acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that the
    indebtedness evidenced by the Debentures, including the
    principal thereof (and premium, if any) and interest thereon,
    shall be subordinated and subject, to the extent and in the
    manner herein set forth, in right of payment to the prior
    payment in full of all Superior Debt.  The provisions of this
    Article are made for the benefit of all holders of Superior
    Debt and any such holder may proceed to enforce such
    provisions.

         SECTION 1202.  Payment Over of Proceeds Upon
    Dissolution, etc.

         In the event of any insolvency or bankruptcy
    proceedings, and any receivership, liquidation,
    reorganization or other similar proceedings in connection
    therewith, relative to the Company or to its creditors, as
    such, or to its property, and in the event of any proceedings
    for voluntary liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of
    the Company, whether or not involving insolvency or
    bankruptcy, then the holders of Superior Debt shall be
    entitled to receive payment in full of all principal of (and
    premium, if any) and interest on all Superior Debt before the
    Holders are entitled to receive any payment on account of
    principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the
    Debentures, and to that end the holders of Superior Debt or
    the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which
    any instrument evidencing any of such Superior Debt may have
    been issued, as their respective interests may appear, shall
    be entitled to receive directly from the trustee in
    bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for benefit or creditors or
    other liquidating agent or person making such payment or
    distribution, any payment or distribution of any kind or
    character, whether in cash or property or securities which
    may be payable or deliverable in any such proceedings with
    respect of the Debentures (other than securities which are
    subordinate and junior in right of payment, at least to the
    extent provided in this Article with respect to the
    Debentures, to the payment of all Superior Debt then
    outstanding, provided that the rights of the holders of
    Superior Debt are not altered by such proceedings) for the
    application to the pro rata payment of all Superior Debt
    remaining unpaid.

         In the event and during the continuation of any default
    by the Company in the payment of the principal of (or
    premium, if any) or interest on any Superior Debt, or any
    default which with notice or the passage of time, or both,
    would permit any holder or holders of the Superior Debt to
    accelerate the maturity thereof, of which such default
    written notice shall have been given to the Company by any
    holder of Superior Debt, the Company shall not make any
    payments on account of the principal of (or premium, if any)
    or interest on the Debentures.

         In the event that the Debentures are declared due and
    payable before their Stated Maturity because of the
    occurrence of an Event of Default (under circumstances when
    the provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall not be
    applicable), the holders of the Superior Debt outstanding at
    the time the Debentures so become due and payable because of
    such occurrence of such an Event of Default shall be entitled
    to receive payment in full of all principal of (and premium,
    if any) and interest on all Superior Debt before the Holders
    of the Debentures are entitled to receive any payment on
    account of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest
    on the Debentures.

         In the event any payment or distribution (other than
    securities provided for in any proceeding referred to in the
    first paragraph of this Section, the payment of which are
    subordinate and junior, at least to the extent provided for
    in this Article with respect to the Debentures, to the
    payment of all Superior Debt then outstanding, provided that
    the rights of the holders of Superior Debt are not altered by
    such proceeding) prohibited by this Section shall be received
    by the Trustee or the Holders of Debentures before all
    Superior Debt is paid in full, such payment and distribution
    shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid
    over or delivered to, the holders of such Superior Debt or
    their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or
    trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instrument
    evidencing any of such Superior Debt may have been issued, as
    their respective interests may appear, for application to the
    pro rat payment of all Superior Debt remaining unpaid to the
    extent necessary to pay all such Superior Debt in full after
    giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to
    the holders of such Superior Debt.

         The restrictions in this Section on payments on account
    of the principal of the Debentures shall include, but without
    limitation, purchases of Debentures by the Company.

         Subject to the payment in full of all Superior Debt, the
    Holders of Debentures shall be subrogated (equally and
    ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the Company
    which by its express terms ranks on a parity with the
    Debentures and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to
    the rights of the holders of Superior Debt to receive
    payments or distributions of assets of the Company applicable
    to the Superior Debt until the Debentures shall be paid in
    full, and no payments or distributions on the Superior Debt
    pursuant to this Section shall, as between the Company, its
    creditors other than the holders of Superior Debt, and the
    Holders of the Debentures, be deemed to be a payment by the
    Company to or on account of the Debentures, it being
    understood that the provisions of this Article are and are
    intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative
    rights of the Holders of the Debentures, on the one hand, and
    the holders of Superior Debt, on the other hand, and nothing
    contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or
    in the Debentures is intended to or shall impair, as between
    the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Superior
    Debt, and the Holders of the Debentures, the obligation of
    the Company, which is unconditional and absolute, to pay the
    principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the
    Debentures as and when the same shall become due and payable
    in accordance with their terms, or affect the relative rights
    of the Holders of the Debentures and creditors of the Company
    other than the holders of Superior Debt, nor shall anything
    herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any
    Debenture from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by
    applicable law or upon default under this Indenture, subject
    to the rights, if any, under this Article, of the holders of
    Superior Debt in respect of cash, property or securities of
    the Company otherwise payable or delivered to the Trustee or
    such Holder upon the exercise of any such remedy.

         The Company shall give prompt written notice to the
    Trustee of any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or
    reorganization of the Company within the meaning of this
    Article.  The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section
    601, shall be entitled to assume that no such event has
    occurred unless the Company or any one or more holders of
    Superior Debt or any trustee therefor or representative
    thereof has given notice thereof to the Trustee at its
    Corporate Trust Office.  Upon any payment or distribution
    pursuant to this Section, the Trustee shall be entitled to
    rely upon any order or decree of a court of competent
    jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred
    to in this Section are pending, and the Trustee, subject as
    between the Trustee and the Holders to the provisions of
    Section 601, shall be entitled to rely upon a certificate of
    the liquidating trustee or agent or other person making such
    payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the holders for
    the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to
    participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of
    the Superior Debt and other indebtedness of the Company, the
    amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid
    or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto
    or to this Article.  In the event that the Trustee
    determines, in good faith, that further evidence is required
    with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of
    Superior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution
    pursuant to this section, the Trustee may request such Person
    to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the
    Trustee as to the amount of Superior Debt held by such
    Person, as to the extent to which such Person is entitled to
    participate in such payment or distribution, and as to other
    facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this
    Article, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee
    may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial
    determination as to the right of such Person to receive such
    payment.  The trustee, subject to the provisions of Section
    601, shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the
    holders of Superior Debt, and shall not be liable to any such
    holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to
    Holders of Debentures or the Company or any other person,
    monies or assets to which any holder of Superior Debt shall
    be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise.

         Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or
    payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607.

         SECTION 1203.  Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.

         The Holder of each Debenture by his acceptance thereof
    authorizes the Trustee in his behalf to take such action as
    may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate
    the subordination as provided in this Article and appoints
    the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such
    purposes.

         SECTION 1204.  Trustee Not Charged with Knowledge of
    Prohibition.

         Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article or any
    other provision of this Indenture, but subject as between the
    Trustee and the Holders to the provisions of Section 601, the
    Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence
    of any Superior Debt, or of any facts which would prohibit
    the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee
    unless and until the Trustee shall have received written
    notice thereof at its Corporate Trust Office from the Company
    or from one or more holders of Superior Debt or from any
    trustee therefor or representative thereof who shall have
    been certified to be such by the Company or who shall have
    otherwise established to the reasonable satisfaction of the
    Trustee that he is such a holder, trustee or representative;
    and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the
    Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601, shall be
    entitled in all respect to assume that no such facts exist;
    provided, that, if on a date not less than three Business
    Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any
    such monies may become payable for any purpose (including,
    without limitation, the payment of either the principal,
    premium, if any, or interest on any Debenture), or if on a
    date not less than three Business Days prior to the date of
    the execution of an instrument pursuant to Section 401
    acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture,
    the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for
    in this Section, then, anything herein contained to the
    contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power
    and authority to receive such monies and to apply the same to
    the purpose for which they were received, and, in the case of
    such instrument, to execute the same, and shall not be
    affected by any notice to the contrary, which may be received
    by it on or after such prior date; nor shall the Trustee be
    charged with knowledge of the curing of any such default or
    of the elimination of the act or condition preventing any
    such default or of the elimination of the act or condition
    preventing any such payment unless and until the Trustee
    shall have received an Officers' Certificate to such effect.

         SECTION 1205.  Rights of Trustee as Holder of Superior
    Debt.

         The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set
    forth in this Article with respect to any Superior Debt which
    may at any time be held by it in its individual capacity, to
    the same extent as any other holder of Superior Debt; and
    nothing in Section 613, or elsewhere in this Indenture, shall
    deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.

         SECTION 1206.  Article Applicable to Paying Agents.

         In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the
    Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then
    acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this Article
    shall in such case (unless the context shall otherwise
    require) be construed as extending to and including such
    Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and
    purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article
    in addition to or in place of the Trustee; provided, however,
    that Sections 1204 and 1205 shall not apply to the Company or
    any Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as
    Paying Agent.

                             * * * *

         This Indenture may be executed in any number of
    counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be
    an original, but all such counterparts shall together
    constitute but one and the same Indenture.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
    Indenture to be duly executed and acknowledged, and their
    respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed and
    attested, all as of the day and year first above written.

                          AMENDED AND RESTATED
                            RIGHTS AGREEMENT


         Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of June
    22, 1990 between Tandy Corporation, a Delaware corporation
    (the "Company"), and The First National Bank of Boston, a
    national banking association (the "Rights Agent").

         Whereas, on August 15, 1986, the Board of Directors of
    the Company authorized and declared a dividend of one
    preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each Common
    Share (as hereinafter defined) of the Company outstanding as
    of the close of business on August 29, 1986, each Right
    representing the right to purchase one one-thousandth of a
    share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock,
    without par value, of the Company having the rights and
    preferences set forth in the form of the Certificate of
    Designation, Preferences and Rights attached hereto as
    Exhibit A, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
    herein set forth, and further authorized the issuance of one
    Right with respect to each Common Share that shall become
    outstanding between August 29, 1986 and the earliest of the
    Distribution Date, the Redemption Date and the Final
    Expiration Date (as such terms are in defined in Sections 3
    and 7 hereof);

         Whereas, on June 24, 1988, the Board of Directors of the
    Company resolved to amend this Agreement and such amendments
    became effective by agreement with the Rights Agent;

         Whereas, on June 22, 1990, the Board of Directors of the
    Company resolved further to amend and to restate in its
    entirety this Agreement, and such amendments became effective
    by agreement with the Rights Agent (the "Second Amendment
    Date").

         Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the
    mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree
    as follows:

         Section 1.  Certain Definitions.  For purposes of this
     Agreement, the following terms have the meanings indicated:

              (a)  "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person who
    or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such
    Person, without the prior approval of at least a majority of
    the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), shall
    be the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the Common Shares
    then outstanding (other than as a result of a Permitted Offer
    (as hereinafter defined)) or was such a Beneficial Owner at
    any time after the date hereof, whether or not such person
    continues to be the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the
    then outstanding Common Shares.  Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, (A) the term "Acquiring Person" shall not include
    (i) the Company, (ii) any Subsidiary of the Company, (iii)
    any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary
    of the Company, or (iv) any Person or entity organized,
    appointed or established by the Company for or pursuant to
    the terms of any such plan, and (B) no Person shall be deemed
    to be an "Acquiring Person" (X) as a result of the
    acquisition of Common Shares by the Company which, by
    reducing the number of Common Shares outstanding, increases
    the proportional number of shares beneficially owned by such
    Person together with all Affiliates and Associates of such
    Person, provided, that if (i) a Person would become an
    Acquiring Person (but for the operation of this sentence) as
    a result of the acquisition of Common Shares by the Company,
    and (ii) after such share acquisition by the Company, such
    Person, or an Affiliate of such Person becomes the Beneficial
    Owner of any additional Common Shares, then such Person shall
    be deemed an Acquiring Person, or (Y) if (i) within 8 days
    after such Person would otherwise have become an Acquiring
    Person, such Person notifies the Board of Directors that such
    person did so inadvertently and (ii) within 2 days after such
    notification, such Person is the Beneficial Owner of less
    than 15% of the outstanding Common Shares.

              (b)  "Affiliate" and "Associate" shall have the
    respective meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of
    the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as in
    effect on the date of this Agreement.

              (c)  A Person shall be deemed the "Beneficial
    Owner" of and shall be deemed to "beneficially own" any
    securities:

                   (i)  which such Person or any of such Person's
    Affiliates or Associates beneficially owns, directly or
    indirectly;

                   (ii)  which such Person or any of such
    Person's Affiliates or Associates has (A) the right to
    acquire (whether such right is exercisable immediately or
    only after the passage of time) pursuant to any agreement,
    arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of
    conversion rights, exchange rights, rights (other than the
    Rights), warrants or options, or otherwise; provided,
    however, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial
    Owner of, or to beneficially own, securities tendered
    pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by or on behalf
    of such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or
    Associates until such tendered securities are accepted for
    purchase or exchange; or (B) the right to vote pursuant to
    any agreement, arrangement or understanding; provided,
    however, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial
    Owner of, or to beneficially own, any security if the
    agreement, arrangement or understanding to vote such security
    (1) arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given to
    such Person in response to a public proxy or consent
    solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the
    applicable rules and regulations of the Exchange Act and (2)
    is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D under the
    Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report); or

                   (iii)  which are beneficially owned, directly
    or indirectly, by any other Person (or any Affiliate or
    Associate thereof) with which such Person or any of such
    Person's Affiliates or Associates has any agreement,
    arrangement or understanding (other than customary agreements
    with and between underwriters and selling group members with
    respect to a bona fide public offering of securities)
    relating to the acquisition, holding, voting (except to the
    extent permitted by subparagraph (ii)(B) of this paragraph
    (c)) or disposing of any securities of the Company.

         Notwithstanding anything in this definition of
    Beneficial Ownership to the contrary, the phrase "then
    outstanding," when used with reference to a Person's
    Beneficial Ownership of securities of the Company, shall mean
    the number of such securities then issued and outstanding
    together with the number of such securities not then actually
    issued and outstanding which such Person would be deemed to
    own beneficially hereunder.

              (d)  "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a
    Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday.

              (e)  "Close of Business" on any given date shall
    mean 5:00 P.M., Boston time, on such date; provided, however,
    that if such date is not a Business Day it shall mean 5:00
    P.M., Boston time, on the next succeeding Business Day.

              (f)  "Common Shares" when used with reference to
    the Company shall mean shares of Common Stock, par value
    $1.00 per share, of the Company.  "Common Shares" when used
    with reference to any Person other than the Company shall
    mean the capital stock (or equity interest) with the greatest
    voting power of such Person or, if such Person is a
    Subsidiary of another Person, the Person or Persons which
    ultimately control such first-mentioned Person.

              (g)  "Disinterested Directors" shall mean the
    members of the Board of Directors who are not officers of the
    Company and who are not Acquiring Persons or their
    Affiliates, Associates or representatives of any of them, or
    any Person who was directly or indirectly proposed or
    nominated as a director of the Company by a Transaction
    Person.

              (h)  "Distribution Date" shall have the meaning set
     forth in Section 3 hereof.

              (i)  "Final Expiration Date" shall have the meaning
    set forth in Section 7 hereof.

              (j)  "Interested Stockholder" shall mean any
    Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate of an
    Acquiring Person or any other Person in which any such
    Acquiring Person, Affiliate or Associate has an interest, or
    any other Person acting directly or indirectly on behalf of
    or in concert with any such Acquiring Person, Affiliate or
    Associate.

              (k)  "Permitted Offer" shall mean a tender or
    exchange offer which is for all outstanding Common Shares at
    a price and on terms determined, prior to the purchase of
    shares under such tender or exchange offer, by at least a
    majority of the Disinterested Directors to be adequate
    (taking into account all factors that such Disinterested
    Directors deem relevant including, without limitation, prices
    that could reasonably be achieved if the Company or its
    assets were sold on an orderly basis designed to realize
    maximum value) and otherwise in the best interests of the
    Company and its stockholders (other than the Person or any
    Affiliate or Associate thereof on whose behalf the offer is
    being made) taking into account all factors that such
    Disinterested Directors may deem relevant.

              (l)  "Person" shall mean any individual, firm,
    partnership, corporation, trust, association, joint venture
    or other entity, and shall include any successor (by merger
    or otherwise) of such entity.

              (m)  "Preferred Shares" shall mean shares of Series
    A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, without par value, of
    the Company having the relative rights, preferences and

         Section 3.  Issuance of Right Certificates.  

              (a)  Until the earlier of (i) the Shares
    Acquisition Date or (ii) the Close of Business on the tenth
    day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the
    Company's Board of Directors), after the date of the
    commencement by any Person (other than the Company, any
    Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the
    Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any Person or
    entity organized, appointed or established by the Company for
    or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) of, or of the
    first public announcement of the intention of any Person
    (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any
    employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of
    the Company or any Person or entity organized, appointed or
    established by the Company for or pursuant to the terms of
    any such plan) to commence (which intention to commence
    remains in effect for five Business Days after such
    announcement), a tender or exchange offer the consummation of
    which would result in any Person becoming an Acquiring
    Person, the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as
    the "Distribution Date," (x) the Rights will be evidenced
    (subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section
    3) by the certificates for Common Shares registered in the
    names of the holders thereof (which certificates shall also
    be deemed to be Right Certificates) and not by separate Right
    Certificates, and (y) the right to receive Right Certificates
    will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of
    Common Shares; provided, however, that if a tender offer is
    terminated prior to the occurrence of a Distribution Date,
    then no Distribution Date shall occur as a result of such
    tender offer.  As soon as practicable after the Distribution
    Date, the Company will prepare and execute, the Rights Agent
    will countersign, and the Company will send or cause to be
    sent, by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record
    holder of Common Shares as of the Close of Business on the
    Distribution Date, at the address of such holder shown on the
    records of the Company, a Right Certificate substantially in
    the form of Exhibit B hereto (a "Right Certificate"),
    evidencing one Right for each Common Share so held.  As of
    and after the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced
    solely by such Right Certificates.

              (b)  As soon as practicable after the Second
    Amendment Date, the Company will send a copy of an amended
    Summary of Rights to Purchase Preferred Shares, in
    substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the
    "Summary of Rights"), by first-class, postage-prepaid mail,
    to each record holder of Common Shares as of the Close of
    Business on the Second Amendment Date, at the address of such
    holder shown on the records of the Company.  With respect to
    certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Second
    Amendment Date, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will
    be evidenced by such certificates registered in the names of
    the holders thereof (together with a copy of the Summary of
    Rights).  Until the Distribution Date (or the earlier of the
    Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date), the surrender
    for transfer of any certificates for Common Shares
    outstanding on the Second Amendment Date, with or without a
    copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto, shall also
    constitute a transfer of the Rights associated with the
    Common Shares represented thereby.

              (c)  Certificates for Common Shares which become
    outstanding (including, without limitation, reacquired Common
    Shares referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph
    (c)) after the Second Amendment Date but prior to the
    earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the
    Final Expiration Date, shall be deemed also to be
    certificates for Rights, and shall bear the following legend:

              This certificate also evidences and entitles the
              holder hereof to certain Rights as set forth in an
              Amended and Restated Rights Agreement between Tandy
              Corporation and The First National Bank of Boston,
              dated as of June 22, 1990 (the "Rights Agreement"),
              the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein
              by reference and a copy of which is on file at the
              principal executive offices of Tandy Corporation
              Under certain circumstances set forth in the Rights
              Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by
              separate certificates and will no longer be
              evidenced by this certificate.  Tandy Corporation
              will mail to the holder of this certificate a copy
              of the Rights Agreement without charge promptly
              following receipt of a written request therefor. 
              Under certain circumstances set forth in the Rights
              Agreement, Rights issued to, or held by, any Person
              who is, was or becomes an Acquiring Person or an
              Affiliate or Associate thereof (as defined in the
              Rights Agreement) and certain related persons,
              whether currently held by or on behalf of such
              Person or by any subsequent holder, may become null
              and void.

    With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing
    legend, until the Distribution Date, the Rights associated
    with the Common Shares represented by such certificates shall
    be evidenced by such certificates alone, and the surrender
    for transfer of any such certificate shall also constitute
    the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares
    represented thereby.  In the event that the Company purchases
    or acquires any Common Shares after the Record Date but prior
    to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such
    Common Shares shall be deemed canceled and retired so that
    the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights
    associated with the Common Shares which are no longer
    outstanding.

         Section 4.  Form of Right Certificates.

              (a)  The Right Certificates (and the forms of
    election to purchase and of assignment to be printed on the
    reverse thereof) shall be substantially in the form set forth
    in Exhibit B hereto and may have such marks of identification
    or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements
    printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as
    are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement,
    or as may be required to comply with any applicable law or
    with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any
    rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which the Rights
    may from time to time be listed, or to conform to usage. 
    Subject to the provisions of Sections 11 and 22 hereof, the
    Rights Certificate shall entitle the holders thereof to
    purchase such number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred
    Share as shall be set forth therein at the price per one
    one-thousandth of a Preferred Share set forth therein (the
    "Purchase Price"), but the amount and type of securities
    purchasable upon the exercise of each Right and the Purchase
    Price thereof shall be subject to adjustment as provided
    herein.

              (b)  Any Right Certificate issued pursuant to
    Section 3(a) or Section 22 hereof that represents Rights
    which are null and void pursuant to Section 7(e) of this
    Agreement and any Right Certificate issued pursuant to
    Section 6 or Section 11 hereof upon transfer, exchange,
    replacement or adjustment of any other Right Certificate
    referred to in this sentence, shall contain (to the extent
    feasible) the following legend:

              The Rights represented by this Right Certificate
              are or were beneficially owned by a Person who was
              or became an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or
              Associate of an Acquiring Person (as such terms are
              defined in the Rights Agreement).  Accordingly,
              this Right Certificate and the Rights represented
              hereby are null and void.

    Provisions of Section 7(e) of this Rights Agreement shall be
    operative whether or not the foregoing legend is contained on
    any such Right Certificate.

         Section 5.  Countersignature and Registration.  The
    Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company
    by its Chairman of the Board, its President or any Vice
    President, either manually or by facsimile signatue, and
    have affixed thereto the Company's seal or a facsimile
    thereof, and shall be attested by the Secretary, or an
    Assistant Secretary, of the Company, either manually or by
    facsimile signature.  The Right Certificates shall be
    countersigned by the Rights Agent and shall not be valid for
    any purpose unless so countersigned.  In case any officer of
    the Company who shall have signed any of the Right
    Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company
    before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and
    delivery by the Company, such Right Certificates,
    nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent, and
    issued and delivered by the Company with the same force and
    effect as though the person who signed such Right
    Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the
    Company; and any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of
    the Company by any person who, at the actual date of the
    execution of such Right Certificate, shall be a proper
    officer of the Company to sign such Right Certificate,
    although at the date of the execution of this Rights
    Agreement any such person was not such an officer.

         Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will
    keep or cause to be kept, at the office of the Rights Agent
    designated for such purposes, books for registration and
    transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder.  Such
    books shall show the names and addresses of the respective
    holders of the Right Certificates, the number of Rights
    evidenced on its face by each of the Right Certificates and
    the date and certificate number of each of the Right
    Certificates.

         Section 6.  Transfer, Split Up, Combination and Exchange
    of Right Certificates; Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen
    Right Certificates.  Subject to the provisions of Sections
    4(b), 7(e), 11 and 14 hereof, at any time after the Close of
    Business on the Distribution Date, and at or prior to the
    Close of Business on the earlier of the Redemption Date or
    the Final Expiration Date, any Right Certificate or Right
    Certificates may be transferred, split up, combined or
    exchanged for another Right Certificate or Right
    Certificates, entitling the registered holder to purchase a
    like number of one one- thousandths of a Preferred Share (or,
    following a Triggering Event, other securities, as the case
    may be) as the Right Certificate or Right Certificates
    surrendered then entitled such holder (or its transferor in
    the case of a transfer) to purchase.  Any registered holder
    desiring to transfer, split up, combine or exchange any Right
    Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in
    writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender
    the Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be
    transferred, split-up, combined or exchanged, with the form
    of assignment and certificate appropriately executed, at the
    principal office or offices of the Rights Agent designated
    for such purpose.  Neither the Rights Agent nor the Company
    shall be obligated to take any action whatsoever with respect
    to the transfer of any such surrendered Right Certificate
    until the registered holder shall have completed and signed
    the certificate contained in the form of assignment on the
    reverse side of such Right Certificate and shall have
    provided such additional evidence of the identity of the
    Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates
    or Associates thereof as the Company shall reasonably
    request.  Thereupon the Rights Agent shall, subject to the
    provisions of Sections 4(b), 7(e), 11 and 14 hereof,
    countersign and deliver to the person entitled thereto a
    Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be,
    as so requested.  The Company may require payment of a sum
    sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may
    be imposed in connection with any transfer, split-up,
    combination or exchange of Right Certificates.

         Upon receipt by the Company and the Rights Agent of
    evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft,
    destruction or mutilation of a Right Certificate, and, in
    case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security
    reasonably satisfactory to them, and, at the Company's
    request, reimbursement to the Company and the Rights Agent of
    all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon
    surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right
    Certificate if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a
    new Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for
    countersignature and delivery to the registered owner in lieu
    of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or
    mutilated.

         Section 7.  Exercise of Rights; Purchase Price;
    Expiration Date of Rights.

              (a)  Subject to Section 7(e) hereof, the registered
    holder of any Right Certificate may exercise the Rights
    evidenced thereby (except as otherwise provided herein) in
    whole or in part at any time after the Distribution Date upon
    surrender of the Right Certificate, with the form of election
    to purchase and the certificate on the reverse side thereof
    duly executed, to the Rights Agent at the principal office or
    offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose,
    together with payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the
    total number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share (or
    other securities as the case may be) as which such
    surrendered Rights are exercised, at or prior to the earlier
    of (i) the Close of Business on June 22, 2000 (the "Final
    Expiration Date"), or (ii) the time at which the Rights are
    redeemed as provided in Section 23 hereof (the "Redemption
    Date").

              (b)  The Purchase Price for each one one-thousandth
    of a Preferred Share pursuant to the exercise of a Right
    shall initially be $140, shall be subject to adjustment from
    time to time as provided in Sections 11 and 13(a) hereof and
    shall be payable in accordance with paragraph (c) below. 
    Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
    in the event that at any time after the date of this
    Agreement and prior to the Distribution Date, the Company
    shall (i) declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares
    payable in Common Shares or (ii) effect a subdivision,
    combination or consolidation of the Common Shares (by
    reclassification or otherwise than by payment of dividends in
    Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common
    Shares, then in any such case, the number of Rights shall be
    similarly adjusted such that each Common Share outstanding
    thereafter shall carry with it one Right, and the Purchase
    Price following any such event shall be proportionately
    adjusted to equal the result obtained by multiplying the
    Purchase Price immediately prior to such event by a fraction
    the numerator of which shall be the total number of Common
    Shares outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of the
    event and the denominator of which shall be the total number
    of Common Shares outstanding immediately following the
    occurrence of such event.  The adjustment provided for in the
    preceding sentence shall be made successively whenever such a
    dividend is declared or paid or such a subdivision,
    combination or consolidation is effected.

              (c)  Upon receipt of a Right Certificate
    representing exercisable Rights, with the form of election to
    purchase and the certificate duly executed, accompanied by
    payment of the Purchase Price for the Preferred Shares (or
    other securities, as the case may be) and an amount equal to
    any applicable transfer tax required to be paid by the holder
    of such Right Certificate in accordance with Section 6 and
    Section 9 hereof by certified check, cashier's check or money
    order payable to the order of the Company, the Rights Agent
    shall thereupon promptly (i) (A) requisition from any
    transfer agent of the Preferred Shares certificates for the
    number of Preferred Shares to be purchased and the Company
    hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent to comply
    with all such requests, or (B) if the Company, in its sole
    discretion, shall have elected to deposit the Preferred
    Shares issuable upon exercise of the Rights hereunder into a
    depositary, requisition from the depositary agent depositary
    receipts representing such number of one one-thousandths of a
    Preferred Share as are to be purchased (in which case
    certificates for the Preferred Shares represented by such
    receipts shall be deposited by the transfer agent with the
    depositary agent) and the Company hereby directs the
    depositary agent to comply with such request, (ii) when
    appropriate, requisition from the Company the amount of cash
    to be paid in lieu of issuance of fractional interests in
    shares in accordance with Section 14 hereof, (iii) promptly
    after receipt of such certificates or depositary receipts,
    cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the
    registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in
    such name or names as may be designated by such holder and
    (iv) when appropriate, after receipt thereof, promptly
    deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered
    holder of such Right Certificate.

         In the event that the Company is obligated to issue
    other securities (including Common Shares) of the Company
    pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the Company will make all
    arrangements necessary so that such other securities are
    available for distribution by the Rights Agent, if and when
    appropriate.

         In addition, in the case of an exercise of the Rights by
    a holder pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii), the Rights Agent
    shall return such Right Certificate to the registered holder
    thereof after imprinting, stamping or otherwise indicating
    thereon that the Rights represented by such Right Certificate
    no longer include the rights provided by Section 11(a)(ii) of
    the Rights Agreement and if less than all the Rights
    represented by such Right Certificate were so exercised, the
    Rights Agent shall indicate on the Right Certificate the
    number of Rights represented thereby which continue to
    include the rights provided by Section 11(a)(ii).

              (d)  In case the registered holder of any Right
    Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced
    thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent
    to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the
    Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right
    Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to the
    provisions of Section 14 hereof, or an appropriate notation
    shall be put on the Right Certificate with respect to those
    Rights exercised.

              (e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
    the contrary, from and after the first occurrence of a
    Section 11(a)(ii) Event, any Rights beneficially owned by (i)
    an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of an
    Acquiring Person, (ii) a transferee of an Acquiring Person
    (or of any Affiliate or Associate thereof) who becomes a
    transferee after the Acquiring Person becomes such, or (iii)
    a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of any Affiliate or
    Associate thereof) who becomes a transferee prior to or
    concurrently with the Acquiring Person becoming such and
    receives such Rights pursuant to either (A) a transfer
    (whether or not for consideration) from the Acquiring Person
    to holders of equity interest in such Acquiring Person or to
    any Person with whom the Acquiring Person has a continuing
    agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the
    transferred Rights or (B) a transfer which the Board of
    Directors of the Company has determined is part of a plan,
    arrangement or understanding which has as a primary purpose
    or effect the avoidance of this Section 7(e), shall become
    null and void without any further action and no holder of
    such Rights shall have any rights whatsoever with respect to
    such Rights, whether under any provision of this Agreement or
    otherwise.  The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
    insure that the provisions of this Section 7(e) and Section
    4(b) hereof are complied with, but shall have no liability to
    any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result
    of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an
    Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees
    hereunder.

              (f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
    the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall
    be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a
    registered holder upon the occurrence of any purported
    exercise as set forth in this Section 7 unless such
    registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the
    certificate contained in the form of election to purchase set
    forth on the reverse side of the Right Certificate
    surrendered for such exercise and (ii) provided such
    additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner
    (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates
    thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.

         Section 8.  Cancellation and Destruction of Right
    Certificates.  All Right Certificates surrendered for the
    purpose of exercise, transfer, split up, combination or
    exchange shall, if surrendered to the Company or to any of
    its agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation
    or in canceled form, or if surrendered to the Rights Agent,
    shall be canceled by it, and no Right Certificates shall be
    issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any
    of the provisions of this Rights Agreement.  The Company
    shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and
    retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire,
    any other Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the
    Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof.  The Rights
    Agent shall deliver all canceled Right Certificates to the
    Company, or shall, at the written request of the Company,
    destroy such canceled Right Certificates, and in such case
    shall deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the
    Company.

         Section 9.  Reservation and Availability of Preferred
    Shares.  The Company covenants and agrees that it will cause
    to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and
    unissued Preferred Shares, or any authorized and issued
    Preferred Shares held in its treasury, the number of
    Preferred Shares that will be sufficient to permit the
    exercise in full of all outstanding Rights and, after the
    occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, shall to the extent
    reasonably practicable so reserve and keep available a
    sufficient number of Common Shares (and/or other securities)
    which may be required to permit the exercise in full of the
    Rights pursuant to this Agreement.

         So long as the Preferred Shares (and, after the
    occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) event, Common Shares or any
    other securities) issuable upon the exercise of Rights may be
    listed on any national securities exchange, the Company shall
    use its best efforts to cause, from and after such time as
    the Rights become exercisable, all shares reserved for such
    issuance to be listed on such exchange upon official notice
    of issuance upon such exercise.

         The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all
    such action as may be necessary to ensure that all Preferred
    Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case
    may be) delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time
    of delivery of the certificates for such shares or other
    securities (subject to payment of the Purchase Price), be
    duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and
    nonassessable shares or securities.

         The Company further covenants and agrees that it will
    pay when due and payable any and all U.S. federal and state
    transfer taxes and charges that may be payable in respect of
    the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any
    Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities,
    as the case may be) upon the exercise of Rights.  The Company
    shall not, however, be required to pay any transfer tax that
    may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of
    Right Certificates to a person other than, or the issuance or
    delivery of certificates or depositary receipts for the
    Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other securities,
    as the case may be) in a name other than that of, the
    registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing Rights
    surrendered for exercise, or to issue or deliver any
    certificates or depositary receipts for Preferred Shares (or
    Common Shares and/or other securities as the case may be)
    upon the exercise of any Rights, until any such tax shall
    have been paid (any such tax being payable by the holder of
    such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it
    has been established to the Company's satisfaction that no
    such tax is due.

         The Company shall use its best efforts to (i) file, as
    soon as practicable following the Shares Acquisition Date, a
    registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
    "Act"), with respect to the securities purchasable upon
    exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, (ii) cause
    such registration statement to become effective as soon as
    practicable after such filing, and (iii) cause such
    registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus
    at all times meeting the requirements of the Act and the
    rules and regulations thereunder) until the date of the
    expiration of the rights provided by Section 11(a)(ii).  The
    Company will also take such action as may be appropriate
    under the blue sky laws of the various states.

         Section 10.  Record Date.  Each person in whose name any
    certificate for Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or
    other securities, as the case may be) is issued upon the
    exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have
    become the holder of record of the Preferred Shares (or
    Common Shares and/or other securities, as the case may be)
    represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated
    the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such
    Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price
    (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made; provided,
    however, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a
    date upon which the Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or
    other securities, as the case maybe) transfer books of the
    Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have
    become the record holder of such shares on, and such
    certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day
    on which the Preferred Shares (or Common Shares and/or other
    securities, as the case may be) transfer books of the Company
    are open.

         Section 11.  Adjustment of Purchase Price, Number of
    Shares or Number of Rights.  The Purchase Price, the number
    and kind of shares covered by each Right and the number of
    Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment from time to
    time as provided in this Section 11.

              (a)  (i)  In the event the Company shall at any
    time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare a dividend
    on the Preferred Shares payable in Preferred Shares, (B)
    subdivide the outstanding Preferred Shares, (C) combine the
    outstanding Preferred Shares into a smaller number of
    Preferred Shares or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock
    in a reclassification of the Preferred Shares (including any
    such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or
    merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving
    corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section
    11(a) and Section 7(e) hereof, the Purchase Price in effect
    at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the
    effective date of such subdivision, combination or
    reclassification, and the number and kind of shares of
    capital stock issuable on such date, shall be proportionately
    adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such
    time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and
    kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been
    exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when
    the Preferred Shares transfer books of the Company were open,
    such holder would have owned upon such exercise and been
    entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision,
    combination or reclassification; provided, however, that in
    no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise
    of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the
    shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise
    of one Right.  If an event occurs which would require an
    adjustment under both Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii),
    the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be
    in addition to, and shall be made prior to, any adjustment
    required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii).

                   (ii)  In the event any Person, alone or
    together with its Affiliates and Associates, shall become an
    Acquiring Person, then proper provision shall be made so that
    each holder of a Right (except as provided below and in
    Section 7(e) hereof) shall, for a period of 60 days after the
    later of the occurrence of any such event or the effective
    date of an appropriate registration statement under the Act
    pursuant to Section 9 hereof, have a right to receive, upon
    exercise thereof at a price equal to the then current
    Purchase Price, in accordance with the terms of this
    Agreement, such number of Common Shares (or, in the
    discretion of the Board of Directors, one one-thousandths of
    a Preferred Share) as shall equal the result obtained by (x)
    multiplying the then current Purchase Price by the then
    number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share for which
    a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the first
    occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, and dividing that
    product by (y) 50% of the then current per share market price
    of the Company's Common Shares (determined pursuant to
    Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of such first occurrence
    (such number of shares being referred to as the "Adjustment
    Shares"); provided, however, that if the transaction that
    would otherwise give rise to the foregoing adjustment is also
    subject to the provisions of Section 13 hereof, then only the
    provisions of Section 13 hereof shall apply and no adjustment
    shall be made pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii);

                   (iii)  In the event that there shall not be
    sufficient treasury shares or authorized but unissued (and
    unreserved) Common Shares to permit the exercise in full of
    the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii)
    and the Rights become so exercisable (and the Board has
    determined to make the Rights exercisable into fractions of a
    Preferred Share), notwithstanding any other provision of this
    Agreement, to the extent necessary and permitted by
    applicable law, each Right shall thereafter represent the
    right to receive, upon exercise thereof at the then current
    Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of this
    Agreement, (x) a number of (or fractions of) Common Shares
    (up to the maximum number of Common Shares which may
    permissibly be issued) and (y) a number of (or fractions of)
    one one-thousandths of a Preferred Share or a number of, or
    fractions of other equity securities of the Company (or, in
    the discretion of the Board of Directors, debt) which the
    Board of Directors of the Company has determined to have the
    same aggregate current market value (determined pursuant to
    Section 11(d)(i) and (ii) hereof, to the extent applicable),
    as one Common Share (such number of, or fractions of,
    Preferred Shares, debt, or other equity securities or debt of
    the Company being referred to as a "capital stock
    equivalent"), equal in the aggregate to the number of
    Adjustment Shares; provided, however, if sufficient Common
    Shares and/or capital stock equivalents are unavailable, then
    the Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
    take all such action as may be necessary to authorize
    additional Common Shares or capital stock equivalents for
    issuance upon exercise of the Rights, including the calling
    of a meeting of stockholders; and provided, further, that if
    the Company is unable to cause sufficient Common Shares
    and/or capital stock equivalents to be available for issuance
    upon exercise in full of the Rights, within thirty (30) days
    following the date of occurrence of the first to occur of the
    events listed in the foregoing clause (ii) of this Section
    11(a) (such date being referred to herein as the "Section
    11(a)(ii) Trigger Date"), then the Company (A) shall
    determine the excess of (1) the value of the Common Shares
    issuable upon the exercise of a Right pursuant to the
    foregoing clause (ii) of this Section 11(a) (the "Current
    Value") over (2) the then current Purchase Price (such excess
    being referred to herein as the "Spread") and (B) shall be
    obligated to deliver, upon the surrender for exercise of a
    Right and without requiring payment of the Purchase Price,
    Common Shares (to the extent available) and then, if
    necessary, cash, which shares and/or cash have an aggregate
    value equal to the Spread.  Notwithstanding the immediately
    preceding sentence, if the Board of Directors of the Company
    shall determine in good faith that it is likely that
    sufficient additional Common Shares could be authorized for
    issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights, the thirty (30)
    day period set forth above may be extended to the extent
    necessary, but not to more than ninety (90) days after the
    Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date, in order that the Company may
    seek shareholder approval for the authorization of such
    additional shares (such period, as it may be extended, being
    referred to herein as the "Substitution Period").  To the
    extent that the Company determines that some action need be
    taken pursuant to the first and/or second sentences of this
    Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, subject to
    the foregoing clause (ii) of this Section 11(a), that such
    action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights
    (except that, to the extent reasonably necessary to avoid the
    issuance of fractional Common Shares, such action may provide
    for the issuance of Common Shares upon the exercise of more
    than a specified number of Rights, and issuance of other
    equity or debt securities upon the exercise of such specified
    number (or any lesser number) of Rights) and (y) may suspend
    the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the
    Substitution Period in order to seek any authorization of
    additional shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of
    distribution to be made pursuant to such first sentence and
    to determine the value thereof.  In the event of any such
    suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement
    stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been
    temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at
    such time as the suspension is no longer in effect.

              (b)  In case the Company shall fix a record date
    for the issuance of rights (other than the Rights), options
    or warrants to all holders of Preferred Shares entitling them
    (for a period expiring within 45 calendar days after such
    record date) to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares
    (or shares having the same rights, privileges and preferences
    as the Preferred Shares ("equivalent preferred shares")) or
    securities convertible into Preferred Shares or equivalent
    preferred shares at a price per Preferred Share or equivalent
    preferred share (or having a conversion price per share, if a
    security convertible into Preferred Shares or equivalent
    preferred shares) less than the current per share market
    price of the Preferred Shares (as defined in Section 11(d))
    on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after
    such record date shall be determined by multiplying the
    Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record
    date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
    number of Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date
    plus the number of Preferred Shares which the aggregate
    offering price of the total number of Preferred Shares and/or
    equivalent preferred shares so to be offered (and/or the
    aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible
    securities so to be offered) would purchase at such current
    market price and the denominator of which shall be the number
    of Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date plus the
    number of additional Preferred Shares and/or equivalent
    preferred shares to be offered for subscription or purchase
    (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered
    are initially convertible); provided, however, that in no
    event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of
    one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares
    of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one
    Right.  In case such subscription price may be paid in a
    consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other
    than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as
    determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
    Company, whose determination shall be described in a
    statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on
    the Rights Agent.  Preferred Shares owned by or held for the
    account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for
    the purpose of any such computation.  Such adjustment shall
    be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed;
    and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are
    not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the
    Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record
    date had not been fixed.

              (c)  In case the Company shall fix a record date
    for the making of a distribution to all holders of the
    Preferred Shares (including any such distribution made in
    connection with a consolidation or merger in which the
    Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of
    evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a regular
    quarterly cash dividend or a dividend payable in Preferred
    Shares) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those
    referred to in Section 11(b)), the Purchase Price to be in
    effect after such record date shall be determined by
    multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to
    such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall
    be the then current per share market price (as determined
    pursuant to Section 11(d)) of the Preferred Shares on such
    record date, less the fair market value (as determined in
    good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose
    determination shall be described in a statement filed with
    the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights Agent) of
    the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so to
    be distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants
    applicable to one Preferred Share and the denominator of
    which shall be such current per share market price of the
    Preferred Shares; provided, however, that in no event shall
    the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right
    be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital
    stock of the Company to be issued upon exercise of one Right. 
    Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a
    record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution
    is not so made, the Purchase Price shall again be adjusted to
    be the Purchase Price that would then be in effect if such
    record date had not been fixed.

              (d)  (i)  For the purpose of any computation
    hereunder, the "current per share market price" of any
    security (a "Security" for the purpose of this Section
    11(d)(i)) on any date shall be deemed to be the average of
    the daily closing prices per share of such Security for the
    thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days (as such term is
    hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date;
    provided, however, that in the event that the current per
    share market price of the Security is determined during a
    period following the announcement by the issuer of such
    Security of (1) a dividend or distribution on such Security
    payable in shares of such Security or securities convertible
    into such Security, or (2) any subdivision, combination or
    reclassification of such Security, and prior to the
    expiration of thirty (30) Trading Days after the ex-dividend
    date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date
    for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then,
    and in each such case, the current per share market price
    shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the current market
    price per share equivalent of such Security.  The closing
    price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way,
    or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average
    of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either
    case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction
    reporting system with respect to securities listed or
    admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the
    Security is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York
    Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated
    transaction reporting system with respect to securities
    listed on the principal national securities exchange on which
    the Security is listed or admitted to trading or, if the
    Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national
    securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so
    quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in
    the over-the-counter market, as reported by the National
    Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations
    System ("NASDAQ") or such other system then in use, or, if on
    any such date the Security is not quoted by any such
    organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices
    as furnished by a professional market maker making a market
    in the Security selected by the Board of Directors of the
    Company.  If on any such date no such market maker is making
    a market in the Security, the fair value of the Security on
    such date as determined in good faith by the Board of
    Directors of the Company shall be used.  The term "Trading
    Day" shall mean a day on which the principal national
    securities exchange on which the Security is listed or
    admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business
    or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on
    any national securities exchange, a Business Day.

                   (ii)  For the purpose of any computation
    hereunder, the "current per share market price" of the
    Preferred Shares shall be determined in the same manner as
    set forth in clause (i) of this Section 11(d).  If the
    Preferred Shares are not publicly traded, the "current per
    share market price" of the Preferred Shares shall be
    conclusively deemed to be the current per share market price
    of the Common Shares as determined pursuant to Section
    11(d)(i) (appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split,
    stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the
    date hereof), multiplied by one thousand.  If neither the
    Common Shares nor the Preferred Shares are publicly held or
    so listed or traded, "current per share market price" shall
    mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by
    the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination
    shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent
    and shall be binding on the Rights Agent.

              (e)  Anything herein to the contrary
    notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be
    required unless such adjustment would require an increase or
    decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price; provided,
    however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section
    11(e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward
    and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.  All
    calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the
    nearest cent or to the nearest ten-thousandth of a Common
    Share or other share or one-millionth of a Preferred Share as
    the case may be.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this
    Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11
    shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three (3)
    years from the date of the transaction that requires such
    adjustment or (ii) the Final Expiration Date.

              (f)  If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant
    to Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13(a) hereof, the holder of
    any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to
    receive any shares of capital stock of the Company other than
    Preferred Shares, thereafter the number of such other shares
    so receivable upon exercise of any Right shall be subject to
    adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as
    nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with
    respect to the shares contained in Section 11(a) through (c),
    inclusive, and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14
    with respect to the Preferred Shares shall apply on like
    terms to any such other shares.

              (g)  All Rights originally issued by the Company
    subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price
    hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the
    adjusted Purchase Price, the number of Preferred Shares
    purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the
    Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

              (h)  The Company may elect on or after the date of
    any adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the
    calculations made in Section 11(b) and (c) to adjust the
    number of Rights, in lieu of any adjustment in the number of
    Preferred Shares purchasable upon the exercise of a Right.
    Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the
    number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one
    one-thousandths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was
    exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment.  Each Right
    held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of
    Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the
    nearest one ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase
    Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the
    Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately
    after adjustment of the Purchase Price.  The Company shall
    make a public announcement of its election to adjust the
    number of Rights, indicating the record date for the
    adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the
    adjustment to be made.  This record date may be the date on
    which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any date thereafter,
    but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at
    least ten (10) days later than the date of the public
    announcement.  If Right Certificates have been issued, upon
    each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this
    Section 11(h), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable,
    cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right
    Certificates on such record date Right Certificates
    evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional
    Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of
    such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall
    cause to be distributed to such holders of record in
    substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held
    by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon
    surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right
    Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders
    shall be entitled after such adjustment.  Right Certificates
    so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and
    countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be
    registered in the names of the holders of record of Right
    Certificates on the record date specified in the public
    announcement.

              (i)  Irrespective of any adjustment or change in
    the Purchase Price or the number of one one-thousandths of a
    Preferred Share issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the
    Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may
    continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of one
    one-thousandths of Preferred Shares which were expressed in
    the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.

              (j)  Before taking any action that would cause an
    adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par
    value, if any, of one one-thousandths of Preferred Shares,
    Common Shares or other securities issuable upon exercise of
    the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which
    may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order
    that the Company may validly and legally issue such number of
    fully paid and nonassessable one one-thousandths of Preferred
    Shares, Common Shares or other securities at such adjusted
    Purchase Price.

              (k)  In any case in which this Section 11 shall
    require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made
    effective as of a record date for a specified event, the
    Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event
    the issuance to the holder of any Right exercised after such
    record date the Preferred Shares, Common Shares, or other
    securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such
    exercise over and above the Preferred Shares, Common Shares,
    or other securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon
    such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect
    prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Company
    shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate
    instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such
    additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring
    such adjustment.

              (l)  Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary
    notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such
    reductions in the Purchase Price, in addition to those
    adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to
    the extent that it in its sole discretion shall determine to
    be advisable in order that (i) any consolidation or
    subdivision of the Preferred Shares, (ii) issuance wholly for
    cash of Preferred Shares at less than the current market
    price, (iii) issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Shares or
    securities which by their terms are convertible into or
    exchangeable for Preferred Shares, (iv) stock dividends or
    (v) issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to in
    this Section 11, hereafter made by the Company to holders of
    its Preferred Shares shall not be taxable to suchshareholders.

              (m)  The Company covenants and agrees that it shall
    not, at any time after the Distribution Date, (i) consolidate
    with any other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Company
    in a transaction which does not violate Section 11(n)
    hereof), (ii) merge with or into any other Person (other than
    a Subsidiary of the Company in a transaction which does not
    violate Section 11(n) hereof), or (iii) sell or transfer (or
    permit any Subsidiary to sell or transfer), in one
    transaction, or a series of related transactions, assets or
    earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or
    earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a
    whole) to any other Person or Persons (other than the Company
    and/or any of its Subsidiaries in one or more transactions
    each of which does not violate Section 11(n) hereof), if (x)
    at the time of or immediately after such consolidation,
    merger, sale or transfer there are any charter or by-law
    provisions or any rights, warrants or other instruments or
    securities outstanding or agreements in effect or other
    actions taken, which would materially diminish or otherwise
    eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights
    or (y) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after
    such consolidation, merger or sale, the stockholders of the
    Person who constitutes, or would constitute, the "Principal
    Party" for purposes of Section 13(a) hereof shall have
    received a distribution of Rights previously owned by such
    Person or any of its Affiliates and Associates.  The Company
    may not consummate any such consolidation, merger, sale or
    transfer unless prior thereto the Company and such other
    Person shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent
    a supplemental agreement evidencing compliance with this
    Section 11(m).

              (n)  The Company covenants and agrees that, after
    the Distribution Date, it will not, except as permitted by
    Section 23 or Section 26 hereof, take (or permit any
    Subsidiary to take) any action the purpose of which is to, or
    if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably
    foreseeable that the effect of such action is to, materially
    diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be
    afforded by the Rights.

              (o)  The exercise of rights under Section 11(a)(ii)
    shall only result in the loss of rights under Section11(a)(ii)
    to the extent so exercised and shall not otherwise
    affect the rights represented by the Rights under this Rights
    Agreement, including the rights represented by Section 13.

         Section 12.  Certificate of Adjusted Purchase Price or
    Number of Shares.  Whenever an adjustment is made as provided
    in Sections 11 and 13 hereof, the Company shall promptly (a)
    prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a
    brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment,
    (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent
    for the Common Shares and the Preferred Shares a copy of such
    certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each
    holder of a Right Certificate in accordance with Section 25
    hereof.  The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying
    on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein
    contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any
    adjustment unless and until it shall have received such
    certificate.

         Section 13.  Consolidation, Merger or Sale or Transfer
    of Assets or Earning Power.  (a) In the event that, on or
    following the Shares Acquisition Date, directly or
    indirectly, (i) the Company shall consolidate with, or merge
    with and into, any Interested Stockholder or, if in such
    merger or consolidation all holders of Common Stock are not
    treated alike, any other Person, (ii) the Company shall
    consolidate with, or merge with, any Interested Stockholder
    or, if in such merger or consolidation all holders of Common
    Stock are not treated alike, any other Person, and the
    Company shall be the continuing or surviving corporation of
    such consolidation or merger (other than, in a case of any
    transaction described in (i) or (ii), a merger or
    consolidation which would result in all of the securities
    generally entitled to vote in the election of directors
    ("voting securities") of the Company outstanding immediately
    prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining
    outstanding or by being converted into securities of the
    surviving entity) all of the voting securities of the Company
    or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such
    merger or consolidation and the holders of such securities
    not having changed as a result of such merger or
    consolidation), or (iii) the Company shall sell or otherwise
    transfer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell or
    otherwise transfer), in one transaction or a series of
    related transactions, assets or earning power aggregating 50%
    or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its
    Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any Interested Stockholder
    or Stockholders or, if in such transaction all holders of
    Common Stock are not treated alike, any other Person (other
    than the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in one or
    more transactions each of which does not violate Section
    11(n) hereof), then, and in each such case, proper provision
    shall be made so that (A) each holder of a Right (except as
    provided in Section 7(e) hereof), shall thereafter have the
    right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a price equal
    to the then current Purchase Price, in accordance with the
    terms of this Agreement and in lieu of Preferred Shares, such
    number of freely tradeable Common Shares of the Principal
    Party (as hereinafter defined), not subject to any liens,
    encumbrances, rights of first refusal, or other adverse
    claims, as shall equal the result obtained by (x) multiplying
    the then current Purchase Price by the number of one
    one-thousandths of a Preferred Share for which a Right is
    then exercisable (without taking into account any adjustment
    previously made pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)) and dividing
    that product by (y) 50% of the current per share market price
    of the Common Shares of such Principal Party (determined
    pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of consummation
    of such Section 13 Event; (B) such Principal Party shall
    thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such
    Section 13 Event, all the obligations and duties of the
    Company pursuant to this Agreement; (C) the term "Company"
    shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such Principal Party,
    it being specifically intended that the provisions of Section
    11 hereof shall apply only to such Principal Party following
    the first occurrence of a Section 13 Event; and (D) such
    Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not
    limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of its
    Common Shares) in connection with the consummation of any
    such transaction as may be necessary to assure that the
    provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly
    as reasonably may be, in relation to its Common Shares
    thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights.

              (b)  "Principal Party" shall mean

                   (i)  in the case of any transaction described
    in clause (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of Section 13(a),
    the Person that is the issuer of any securities into which
    Common Shares of the Company are converted in such merger or
    consolidation, and if no securities are so issued, the Person
    that is the other party to such merger or consolidation
    (including, if applicable, the Company if it is the surviving
    corporation ); and

                   (ii)  in the case of any transaction described
    in clause (iii) of the first sentence of Section 13(a), the
    Person that is the party receiving the greatest portion of
    the assets or earning power transferred pursuant to such
    transaction or transactions;

    provided, however, that in any of the foregoing cases, (1) if
    the Common Shares of such Person are not at such time and
    have not been continuously over the preceding twelve (12)
    month period registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act,
    and such Person is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another
    Person the Common Shares of which are and have been so
    registered, "Principal Party" shall refer to such other
    Person; (2) in case such Person is a Subsidiary, directly or
    indirectly, of more than one Person, the Common Shares of two
    or more of which are and have been so registered, "Principal
    Party" shall refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer
    of the Common Shares having the greatest aggregate market
    value; and (3) in case such Person is owned, directly or
    indirectly, by a joint venture formed by two or more Persons
    that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the same
    Person, the rules set forth in (1) and (2) above shall apply
    to each of the chains of ownership having an interest in such
    joint venture as if such party were a "Subsidiary" of both or
    all of such joint venturers and the Principal Parties in each
    such chain shall bear the obligations set forth in this
    Section 13 in the same ratio as their direct or indirect
    interests in such Person bear to the total of such interests.

              (c)  The Company shall not consummate any such
    consolidation, merger, sale or transfer unless the Principal
    Party shall have a sufficient number of its authorized Common
    Shares which have not been issued or reserved for issuance to
    permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with
    this Section 13 and unless prior thereto the Company and such
    Principal Party shall have executed and delivered to the
    Right Agent a supplemental agreement providing for the terms
    set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 13 and
    further providing that, as soon as practicable after the date
    of any consolidation, merger, sale or transfer mentioned in
    paragraph (a) of this Section 13, the Principal Party at its
    own expense shall:

                   (i)  prepare and file a registration statement
    under the Act with respect to the Rights and the securities
    purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate
    form, and will use its best efforts to cause such
    registration statement to (A) become effective as soon as
    practicable after such filing and (B) remain effective (with
    a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the
    Act) until the Final Expiration Date;

                   (ii)  use its best efforts to qualify or
    register the Rights and the securities purchasable upon
    exercise of the Rights under the blue sky laws of such
    jurisdictions as may be necessary or appropriate; and

                   (iii)  deliver to holders of the Rights
    historical financial statements for the Principal Party which
    comply in all respects with the requirements for registration
    on Form 10 under the Exchange Act.

         The provisions of this Section 13 shall similarly apply
    to successive mergers or consolidations or sales or other
    transfers.  The rights under this Section 13 shall be in
    addition to the rights to exercise Rights and adjustments
    under Section 11(a)(ii) and shall survive any exercise
    thereof.

         Section 14.  Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares.

              (a)  The Company shall not be required to issue
    fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates which
    evidence fractional Rights.  In lieu of such fractional
    Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the
    Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional
    Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal
    to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole
    Right.  For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current
    market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of
    the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date
    on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise
    issuable.  The closing price for any day shall be the last
    sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place
    on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices,
    regular way, in either case as reported in the principal
    consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to
    securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York
    Stock Exchange, or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted
    to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the
    principal consolidated transaction reporting system with
    respect to securities listed on the principal national
    securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or
    admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or
    admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the
    last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the
    high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market,
    as reported by NASDAQ or such other system then is use or, if
    on any such date the Rights are not quoted by any such
    organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices
    as furnished by a professional market maker making a market
    in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the
    Company.  If on any such date no such market maker is making
    a market in the Rights, the fair value of the Rights on such
    date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
    the Company shall be used.

              (b)  The Company shall not be required to issue
    fractions of Preferred Shares (other than fractions that are
    one one-thousandth or integral multiples of one
    one-thousandth of a Preferred Share) upon exercise of the
    Rights or to issue certificates which evidence fractional
    Preferred Shares (other than fractions that are one
    one-thousandth or integral multiples of one one-thousandth of
    a Preferred Share).  Fractions of Preferred Shares in
    integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share
    may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by
    depositary receipts, pursuant to an appropriate agreement
    between the Company and a depositary selected by it; provided
    that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such
    depositary receipts shall have all the rights, privileges and
    preferences to which they are entitled as Beneficial Owners
    of the Preferred Shares represented by such depositary
    receipts.  In lieu of fractional Preferred Shares that are
    not one one-thousandth or integral multiples of one
    one-thousandth of a Preferred share, the Company shall pay to
    the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such
    Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash
    equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one
    Preferred Share.  For purposes of this Section 14(b), the
    current market value of a Preferred Share shall be the
    closing price of a Preferred Share (as determined pursuant to
    Section 11(d) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior
    to the date of such exercise.

              (c)  Following the occurrence of one of the
    transactions or events specified in Section 11 giving rise to
    the right to receive Common Shares, capital stock equivalents
    (other than Preferred Shares) or other securities upon the
    exercise of a Right, the Company shall not be required to
    issue fractions of shares or units of such Common Shares,
    capital stock equivalents or other securities upon exercise
    of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence
    fractions of such Common Shares, capital stock equivalents or
    other securities.  In lieu of fractional shares or units of
    such Common Shares, capital stock equivalents or other
    securities, the Company may pay to the registered holders of
    Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as
    herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction
    of the current market value of a share or unit of such Common
    Shares, capital stock equivalents or other securities.  For
    purposes of this Section 14(c), the current market value
    shall be determined in the manner set forth in Section 11(d)
    hereof for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of
    such exercise, and if such capital stock equivalent is not
    traded, each such capital stock equivalent shall have the
    value of one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share.

              (d)  The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the
    Rights expressly waives his right to receive any fractional
    Rights or any fractional shares upon exercise of a Right
    (except as provided above).

         Section 15.  Rights of Action.  All rights of action in
    respect of this Agreement, excepting the rights of action
    given to the Rights Agent under Section 18 hereof, are vested
    in the respective registered holders of the Right
    Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the
    registered holders of the Common Shares); and any registered
    holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to the
    Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), without the consent
    of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right
    Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the
    Common Shares), may in his own behalf and for his own
    benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit,
    action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or
    otherwise act in respect of, his right to exercise the Rights
    evidenced by such Right Certificate in the manner provided in
    such Right Certificate and in this Agreement.  Without
    limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the
    holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the
    holders of the Rights would not have an adequate remedy at
    law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to
    specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive
    relief against actual or threatened violations of, the
    obligations of any Person subject to this Agreement.

         Section 16.  Agreement of Right Holders.  Every holder
    of a Right, by accepting the same, consents and agrees with
    the Company and the Rights Agent and with every other holder
    of a Right that:

              (a)  prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights
    will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of
    the Common Shares;

              (b)  after the Distribution Date, the Right
    Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of
    the Rights Agent if surrendered at the principal office or
    offices of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, duly
    endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer
    and with the appropriate form fully executed;

              (c)  Subject to Section 6 and Section 7(f) hereof,
    the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the
    person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the
    Distribution Date, the associated Common Shares certificate)
    is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights
    evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership
    or writing on the Right Certificates or the associated Common
    Shares certificate made by anyone other than the Company or
    the Rights Agent) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither
    the Company nor the Rights Agent, subject to the last
    sentence of Section 7(e) hereof, shall be affected by any
    notice to the contrary; and

              (d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
    the contrary, neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall
    have any liability to any holder of a Right or a beneficial
    interest in a Right or other Person as a result of its
    inability to perform any of its obligations under this
    Agreement by reason of any preliminary or permanent
    injunction or other order, decree or ruling issued by a court
    of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental, regulatory or
    administrative agency or commission, or any statute, rule,
    regulation or executive order promulgated or enacted by any
    governmental authority, prohibiting or otherwise restraining
    performance of such obligation; provided, however, the
    Company must use its best efforts to have any such order,
    decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as
    possible.

         Section 17.  Right Certificate Holder Not Deemed a
    Stockholder.  No holder, as such, of any Right Certificate
    shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for
    any purpose the holder of the Preferred Shares or any other
    securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable
    on the exercise of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall
    anything contained herein or in any Right Certificate be
    construed to confer upon the holder of any Right Certificate,
    as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or
    any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any
    matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or
    to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to
    receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting
    stockholders (except as provided in Section 24 hereof), or to
    receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any
    preemptive or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the
    Right or Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall
    have been exercised in accordance with the provisions hereof.

         Section 18.  Concerning the Rights Agent.  The Company
    agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for
    all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time,
    on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and
    counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the
    administration and execution of this Agreement and the
    exercise and performance of its duties hereunder.  The
    Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to
    hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, or expense,
    incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct
    on the part of the Rights Agent, for anything done or omitted
    by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and
    administration of this Agreement, including the costs and
    expenses of defending against any claim of liability in the
    premises.  The indemnity provided for herein shall survive
    the expiratation of the Rights and the termination of this
    Agreement.

         The Rights Agent shall be protected and shall incur no
    liability for, or in respect of, any action taken, suffered
    or omitted by it in connection with, its administration of
    this Agreement in reliance upon any Right Certificate or
    certificate for the Preferred Shares or Common Shares or for
    other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or
    transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter,
    notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other
    paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be
    signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or
    acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons.

         Section 19.  Merger or Consolidation or Change of Name
    of Rights Agent.  Any corporation into which the Rights Agent
    or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it
    may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any
    merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any
    successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any corporation
    succeeding to the stock transfer or all or substantially all
    of the corporate trust business of the Rights Agent or any
    successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights
    Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of
    any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
    parties hereto, provided that such corporation would be
    eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under
    the provisions of Section 21 hereof.  In case at the time
    such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency
    created by this Agreement, any of the Right Certificates
    shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such
    successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the
    predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates
    so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right
    Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor
    Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either
    in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of
    the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right
    Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right
    Certificates and in this Agreement.

         In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall
    be changed and at such time any of the Right Certificates
    shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights
    Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and
    deliver Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at
    that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been
    countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Right
    Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name:
    and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the
    full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this
    Agreement.

         Section 20.  Duties of Rights Agent.  The Rights Agent
    undertakes only those duties and obligations imposed by this
    Agreement upon the following terms and conditions, by all of
    which the Company and the holders of Right Certificates, by
    their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:

              (a)  The Rights Agent may consult with legal
    counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the
    opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete
    authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any
    action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance
    with such opinion.

              (b)  Whenever in the performance of its duties
    under this Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary
    or desirable that any fact or matter (including, without
    limitation, the identity of an Acquiring Person and the
    determination of the current market price of any Security) be
    proved or established by the Company prior to taking or
    suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless
    other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically
    prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and
    established by a certificate signed by any one of the
    Chairman of the Board, the President, any Vice President, the
    Treasurer or the Secretary of the Company and delivered to
    the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full
    authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or
    suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this
    Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.

              (c)  The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to
    the Company and any other Person only for its own negligence,
    bad faith or willful misconduct.

              (d)  The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by
    reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained
    in this Agreement or in the Right Certificates (except its
    countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same,
    but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed
    to have been made by the Company only.

              (e)  The Rights Agent shall not be under any
    responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement
    or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due
    execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the
    validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its
    countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for
    any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition
    contained in this Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor
    shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability
    of the Rights (including the Rights becoming void pursuant to
    Section 7(e) hereof) or any adjustment required under the
    provisions of Section 11 or Section 13 hereof or responsible
    for the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment, or
    the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require
    any such adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of
    Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt of a
    certificate described in Section 12 hereof); nor shall it by
    any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or
    warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any
    Preferred Shares or Common Shares to be issued pursuant to
    this Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any
    Preferred Shares or Common Shares will, when issued, be
    validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

              (f)  The Company agrees that it will perform,
    execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed,
    executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and
    other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be
    required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or
    performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this
    Agreement.

              (g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and
    directed to accept instructions with respect to the
    performance of its duties hereunder from any one of the
    Chairman of the Board, the President, any Vice President, the
    Secretary or the Treasurer of the Company, and to apply to
    such officers for advice or instructions in connection with
    its duties, and it shall not be liable for any action taken
    or suffered to be taken by it in good faith in accordance
    with instructions of any such officer or for any delay in
    actions while waiting for those instructions.  Any
    application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from
    the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth
    in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the
    Rights Agent with respect to its duties or obligations under
    this Rights Agreement and the date on or after which such
    action shall be taken or omission shall be effective.  The
    Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or
    omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal
    included in any such application on or after the date
    specified therein (which date shall not be less than five
    Business Days after the date any such officer of the Company
    actually receives such application, unless any such officer
    shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless,
    prior to taking such action (or the effective date in the
    case of an omission), the Rights Agent has received written
    instructions in response to such application specifying the
    action to be taken or omitted.

              (h)  The Rights Agent and any shareholder,
    director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy,
    sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the
    Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction
    in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or
    lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and
    freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this
    Agreement.  Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent
    from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any
    other legal entity.

              (i)  The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any
    of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any
    duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys
    or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or
    accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of
    any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company
    resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct,
    provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection and
    continued employment thereof.

              (j)  No provision of this Agreement shall require
    the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
    incur any financial liability in the performance of any of
    its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if
    there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that
    repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against
    such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

              (k)  If, with respect to any Rights Certificate
    surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the
    certificate attached to the form of assignment or form of
    election to purchase, as the case may be, has not been
    completed, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action
    with respect to such requested exercise of transfer without
    first consulting with the Company.

         Section 21.  Change of Rights Agent.  The Rights Agent
    or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged
    from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 days' notice in
    writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of
    the Common Shares and Preferred Shares by registered or
    certified mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates
    by first-class mail.  The Company may remove the Rights Agent
    or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in
    writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights
    Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the
    Common Shares and Preferred Shares by registered or certified
    mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by
    first-class mail.  If the Rights Agent shall resign or be
    removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the
    Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent.  If
    the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a
    period of 30 days after giving notice of such removal or
    after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or
    incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or
    by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such
    notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the
    Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate
    may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the
    appointment of a new Rights Agent.  Any successor Rights
    Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court,
    shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the
    laws of the United States (or of any state of the United
    States), in good standing, that is authorized under such laws
    to exercise stock transfer or corporate trust powers and is
    subject to supervision or examination by federal or state
    authority and that has at the time of its appointment as
    Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $100
    million.  After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall
    be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and
    responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights
    Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights
    Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights
    Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and
    execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or
    deed necessary for the purpose.  Not later than the effective
    date of any such appointment the Company shall file notice
    thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each
    transfer agent of the Common Shares and Preferred Shares, and
    mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of
    the Right Certificates.  Failure to give any notice provided
    for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall
    not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or
    removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the
    successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.

         Section 22.  Issuance of New Right Certificates.
    Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of
    the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option,
    issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form
    as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any
    adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or
    kind or class of shares or other securities or property
    purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance
    with the provisions of this Agreement.

         In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of
    Common Shares following the Distribution Date and prior to
    the earlier of the Redemption Date and the Final Expiration
    Date, the Company (a) shall with respect to Common Shares so
    issued or sold pursuant to the exercise of stock options or
    under any employee plan or arrangement, or upon the exercise,
    conversion or exchange of securities, notes or debentures
    issued by the Company, and (b) may, in any other case, if
    deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board of Directors of
    the Company, issue Right Certificates representing the
    appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance
    or sale; provided, however, that (i) the Company shall not be
    obligated to issue any such Right Certificates if, and to the
    extent that, the Company shall be advised by counsel that
    such issuance would create a significant risk of material
    adverse tax consequences to the Company or the Person to whom
    such Right Certificate would be issued, and (ii) no Right
    Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that,
    appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have been made in lieu
    of the issuance thereof.

         Section 23.  Redemption and Termination.

              (a)  (i)  The Board of Directors of the Company
    may, at its option, redeem all but not less than all the then
    outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $.05 per Right,
    as such amount may be appropriately adjusted to reflect any
    stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring
    after the date hereof (such redemption price being
    hereinafter referred to as the "Redemption Price"), at any
    time prior to the earlier of (x) the occurrence of a Section
    11(a)(ii) Event, or (y) the Final Expiration Date.

                   (ii)  In addition, the Board of Directors of
    the Company may, at its option, at any time following the
    occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event and the expiration of
    any period during which the holder of Rights may exercise the
    Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) but prior to any Section 13
    Event, redeem all but not less than all of the then
    outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price (aa) in connection
    with any merger, consolidation, or sale or other transfer (in
    one transaction or in a series of related transactions) of
    assets or earning power aggregating 50% or more of the assets
    or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken
    as a whole), in which all holders of Common Shares are
    treated alike and not involving (other than as a holder of
    Common Shares being treated like all other such holders) an
    Interested Stockholder or (bb) if and for so long as the
    Acquiring Person is not thereafter the Beneficial Owner of
    15% of the Common Shares, and at the time of redemption there
    are no other persons who are Acquiring Persons.

              (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
    23(a), in the event that a majority of the Board of Directors
    of the Company is comprised of (i) persons elected at a
    meeting of or by written consent of stockholders and who were
    not nominated by the Board of Directors in office immediately
    prior to such meeting or action by written consent and/or
    (ii) successors of such persons elected to the Board of
    Directors for the purpose of either facilitating a
    Transaction with a Transaction Person or circumventing
    directly or indirectly the provisions of this Section 23(b),
    then (I) the Rights may not be redeemed for a period of 180
    days following the effectiveness of such election if such
    redemption is reasonably likely to have the purpose or effect
    of facilitating a Transaction with a Transaction Person and
    (II) the Rights may not be redeemed thereafter if (x) during
    such 180-day period, the Company enters into any agreement,
    arrangement or understanding with any Transaction Person
    which is reasonably likely to have the purpose or effect of
    facilitating a Transaction with any Transaction Person and
    (y) such redemption is reasonably likely to have the purpose
    or effect of facilitating a Transaction with any Transaction
    Person.

              (c)  In the case of a redemption permitted under
    Section 23(a)(i), immediately upon the date for redemption
    set forth (or determined in the manner specified in) in a
    resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering
    the redemption of the Rights, evidence of which shall have
    been filed with the Rights Agent, and without any further
    action and without any notice, the right to exercise the
    Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the
    holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price
    for each Right so held.  In the case of a redemption
    permitted only under Section 23(a)(ii), evidence of which
    shall have been filed with the Rights Agent, the right to
    exercise the Rights will terminate and represent only the
    right to receive the Redemption Price upon the later of ten
    Business Days following the giving of such notice or the
    expiration of any period during which the rights under
    Section 11(a)(ii) may be exercised.  The Company shall
    promptly give public notice of any such redemption; provided,
    however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such
    notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption. 
    Within ten (10) days after such date for redemption set forth
    in a resolution of the Board of Directors ordering the
    redemption of the Rights, the Company shall mail a notice of
    redemption to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights
    at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry
    books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date,
    on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common
    Shares.  Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein
    provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder
    receives the notice.  Each such notice of redemption will
    state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price
    will be made.  Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates
    or Associates may redeem, acquire or purchase for value any
    Rights at any time in any manner other than that specifically
    set forth in this Section 23 except in connection with the
    purchase of Common Shares prior to the Distribution Date.

              (d)  The Company may, at its option, discharge all
    of its obligations with respect to the Rights by (i) issuing
    a press release announcing the manner of redemption of the
    Rights in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) mailing
    payment of the Redemption Price to the registered holders of
    the Rights at their last addresses as they appear on the
    registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior the Distribution
    Date, on the registry books of the Transfer Agent of the
    Common Shares, and upon such action, all outstanding Rights
    and Right Certificates shall be null and void without any
    further action by the Company.

         Section 24.  Notice of Certain Events.

              (a)  In case the Company shall propose (i) to pay
    any dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of
    its Preferred Shares or to make any other distribution to the
    holders of its Preferred Shares (other than a regular
    quarterly cash dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of its
    Preferred Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or to
    purchase any additional Preferred Shares or shares of stock
    of any class or any other securities, rights or options,
    (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Preferred Shares
    (other than a reclassification involving only the subdivision
    of outstanding Preferred Shares), (iv) to effect any
    consolidation or merger into or with any Person (other than a
    Subsidiary of the Company in a transaction which does not
    violate Section 11(n) hereof), or to effect any sale or other
    transfer (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to
    effect any sale or other transfer), in one or more
    transactions, of 50% or more of the assets or earning power
    of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to,
    any other Person or Persons (other than the Company and/or
    any of its Subsidiaries in one or more transactions each of
    which does not violate Section 11(n) hereof), or (v) to
    effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
    Company, then, in each such case, the Company shall give to
    each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with
    Section 25 hereof, a notice of such proposed action to the
    extent feasible and file a certificate with the Rights Agent
    to that effect, which shall specify the record date for the
    purposes of such stock dividend, or distribution of rights or
    warrants, or the date on which such reclassification,
    consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, liquidation,
    dissolution, or winding up is to take place and the date of
    participation therein by the holders of the Preferred Shares,
    if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so
    given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii)
    above at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date for
    determining holders of the Preferred Shares for purposes of
    such action, and in the case of any such other action, at
    least twenty (20) days prior to the date of the taking of
    such proposed action or the date of participation therein by
    the holders of the Preferred Shares, whichever shall be the
    earlier.

              (b)  In case of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, then (i)
    the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to
    each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with
    Section 25 hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such event,
    which notice shall describe such event and the consequences
    of such event to holders of rights under Section 11(a)(ii)
    hereof and (ii) all references in the preceding paragraph (a)
    to Preferred Shares shall be deemed thereafter to refer also
    to Common Shares and/or, if appropriate, other securities of
    the Company.

         Section 25.  Notices.  Notices or demands authorized by
    this Agreement to be given or made by the Rights Agent or by
    the holder of any Right Certificate to or on the Company
    shall be sufficiently given or made if sent by first-class
    mail, postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is
    filed in writing with the Company) as follows:

                    Attention: Secretary

    Subject to the provisions of Section 21 hereof, any notice or
    demand authorized by this Agreement to be given or made by
    the Company or by the holder of any Right Certificate to or

                    Dorchester, MA 02125

                    Attention: Shareholder Services Division

    Notices or demands authorized by this Agreement to be given
    or made by the Company or the Rights Agent to the holder of

    to the holder of certificates representing Common Shares
    shall be sufficiently given or made if sent by first-class
    mail, postage prepaid, addressed to such holder at the
    address of such holder as shown on the registry books of the
    Company.

         Section 26.  Supplements and Amendments.  The Company
    and the Rights Agent may from time to time supplement or
    amend any provision of this Agreement without the approval of
    any holders of Right Certificates in order (i) to cure any
    ambiguity, (ii) to correct or supplement any provision
    contained herein which may be defective or inconsistent with
    any other provisions herein, or (iii) to make any other
    provisions in regard to matters or questions arising
    hereunder which the Company and the Rights Agent may deem
    necessary or desirable, including but not limited to
    extending the Final Expiration Date and providing that at the
    time of such amendment there is no Acquiring Person, the
    period up to which the Rights may be redeemed, and which
    shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of
    the Right Certificates.  Upon the delivery of a certificate
    from an appropriate officer of the Company which states that
    the proposed supplement or amendment is in compliance with
    the terms of this Section 26, the Rights Agent shall execute
    such supplement or amendment, provided that such supplement
    or amendment does not adversely affect the rights or
    obligations of the Rights Agent under Section 18 or Section
    20 of this Agreement.  Prior to the Distribution Date, the
    interests of the holders of Rights shall be deemed coincident
    with the interests of the holders of Common Shares. 
    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Rights Agreement
    to the contrary, in the event that a majority of the Board of
    Directors of the Company is comprised of (i) persons elected
    at a meeting of or by written consent of stockholders and who
    were not nominated by the Board of Directors in office
    immediately prior to such meeting or action by written
    consent and/or (ii) successors of such persons elected to the
    Board of Directors for the purpose of either facilitating a
    Transaction with a Transaction Person or circumventing
    directly or indirectly the provisions of this Section 26,
    then for a period of 180 days following the effectiveness of
    such action, this Rights Agreement shall not be amended or
    supplemented in any manner reasonably likely to have the
    purpose or effect of facilitating a Transaction with a
    Transaction Person.

         Section 27.  Determination and Actions by the Board of
    Directors, etc.  The Board of Directors of the Company shall
    have the exclusive power and authority to administer this
    Agreement and to exercise all rights and powers specifically
    granted to the Board, or the Company, or as may be necessary
    or advisable in the administration of this Agreement,
    including, without limitation, the right and power to (i)
    interpret the provisions of this Agreement, and (ii) make all
    determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the
    administration of this Agreement (including, without
    limitation, a determination to redeem or not redeem the
    Rights or to amend the Agreement and whether any proposed
    amendment adversely affects the interests of the holders of
    Right Certificates).  For all purposes of this Agreement, any
    calculation of the number of Common Shares or other
    securities outstanding at any particular time, including for
    purposes of determining the particular percentage of such
    outstanding Common Shares or any other securities of which
    any Person is the Beneficial Owner, shall be made in
    accordance with the last sentence of Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of
    the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act as
    in effect on the date of this Agreement.  All such actions,
    calculations, interpretations and determinations (including,
    for purposes of clause (y) below, all omissions with respect
    to the foregoing) which are done or made by the Board in good
    faith, shall (x) be final, conclusive and binding on the
    Company, the Rights Agent, the holders of the Right
    Certificates and all other parties, and (y) not subject the
    Board to any liability to the holders of the Right
    Certificates.

         Section 28.  Successors.  All the covenants and
    provisions of this Agreement by or for the benefit of the
    Company or the Rights Agent shall bind and inure to the
    benefit of their respective successors and assigns hereunder.

         Section 29.  Benefits of this Agreement.  Nothing in
    this Agreement shall be construed to give to any person or
    corporation other than the Company, the Rights Agent and the
    registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to
    the Distribution Date, the Common Shares) any legal or
    equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement; but
    this Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of
    the Company, the Rights Agent and the registered holders of
    the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date,
    the Common Shares).

         Section 30.  Severability.  If any term, provision,
    covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court
    of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
    void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
    provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement
    shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
    affected, impaired or invalidated.

         Section 31.  Governing Law.  This Agreement, each Right
    and each Right Certificate issued hereunder shall be deemed
    to be a contract made under the laws of the State of Delaware
    and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in
    accordance with the laws of such State applicable to
    contracts to be made and performed entirely within such
    State.

         Section 32.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be
    executed in any number of counterparts and each of such
    counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to be an
    original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute
    but one and the same instrument.

         Section 33.  Descriptive Headings.  Descriptive headings
    of the several Sections of this Agreement are inserted for
    convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning
    or construction of any of the provisions hereof.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
    Agreement to be duly executed and their respective corporate
    seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the day
    and year first above written.

                          ARTICLE I

     CERTAIN DEFINED TERMS, ACCOUNTING TERMS AND CONSTRUCTION

         SECTION 1.01 Certain Defined Terms.  As used in this
    Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
    meanings:

         "Account Debtor" shall mean any Person who is or who may
    become obligated to TCC under, with respect to, or on account
    of, an Account purchased by TCC.

         "Accounts" shall mean any and all rights of Tandy, TCC
    and the other Subsidiaries of Tandy to payment for goods and
    services sold or leased, including any such right evidenced
    by chattel paper, whether due or to become due, whether or
    not it has been earned by performance, and whether now or
    hereafter acquired or arising in the future, including
    accounts receivable from Affiliates.

         "Adjusted CD Rate" shall mean, with respect to any
    Borrowing comprised of Certificate of Deposit Loans for any

         "Administrative Agent" shall have the meaning assigned
    such term in the introduction to this Agreement.

         "Administrative Questionnaire" shall mean an
    Administrative Questionnaire in the form of Exhibit 1.01-A

    of the immediate family of any such natural person) who
    directly or indirectly beneficially owns or controls 5% or
    more of the total voting power of shares of capital stock of
    either Borrower having the right to vote for directors under
    ordinary circumstances, any person controlling, controlled by
    or under common control with any such person (within the

                             THE LOANS

         SECTION 2.01.  Commitments.  (a) Subject to the terms
    and conditions and relying upon the representations and
    warranties herein set forth, each Bank, severally and not
    jointly, agrees to make revolving credit loans (each a
    "Tranche A Loan") to the Borrowers at any time and from time
    to time on and after the date hereof and until the earlier of
    the Tranche A Maturity Date and the termination of the
    Tranche A Commitment of such Bank in accordance with the
    terms hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
    aggregate principal amount of all Tranche A Loans of a Bank
    at any time outstanding shall not exceed such Bank's Tranche
    A Commitment, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all
    Tranche A Loans made by all Banks at any time outstanding
    shall not exceed the Total Tranche A Commitment of all Banks,
    (iii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all
    Tranche A Loans plus the aggregate principal amount of all
    Tranche B Loans made by all Banks at any time outstanding
    shall not exceed the Total Commitment and (iv) the sum of the
    aggregate principal amount of all Tranche A Loans plus all
    Tranche B Loans made by all Banks to TCC at any time
    outstanding shall not exceed the Borrowing Base.  Within the
    foregoing limits, the Borrowers may borrow, repay, prepay and
    reborrow Tranche A Loans hereunder on and after the date
    hereof and prior to the Tranche A Maturity Date.

              (b)  Subject to the terms and conditions and
    relying upon the representations and warranties herein set
    forth, each Bank, severally and not jointly, agrees to make
    revolving credit loans (each a "Tranche B Loan") to the
    Borrowers at any time and from time to time on and after the
    date hereof and until the earlier of the Tranche B Maturity
    Date and the termination of the Tranche B Commitment of such
    Bank in accordance with the terms hereof.  Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, (i) the aggregate principal amount of all
    Tranche B Loans of a Bank at any time outstanding shall not
    exceed such Bank's Tranche B Commitment, (ii) the aggregate
    principal amount of all Tranche B Loans made by all Banks at
    any time outstanding shall not exceed the Total Tranche B
    Commitment of all Banks, (iii) the sum of the aggregate
    principal amount of all Tranche B Loans plus the aggregate
    principal amount of all Tranche A Loans made by all Banks at
    any time outstanding shall not exceed the Total Commitment
    and (iv) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all
    Tranche B Loans plus all Tranche A Loans made by all Banks to

    Base.  Within the foregoing limits, the Borrowers may borrow,
    repay, prepay and reborrow Tranche B Loans hereunder; on and
    after the date hereof and prior to the Tranche B Maturity
    Date.

         SECTION 2.02.  Loans.  (a) Each Borrowing made by the
    Banks to a Borrower on any one date shall be in a minimum
    aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 and an integral
    multiple of $1,000,000, and shall consist of Loans of the
    same Tranche made ratably by the Banks in accordance with
    their respective Commitments; provided, however, that the
    failure of any Bank to make any Loan shall not relieve any
    other Bank of its obligation to lend hereunder.  The first
    Loan by each Bank to a Borrower shall be made against
    delivery to such Bank of an appropriate Note, payable to the
    order of such Bank, executed by such Borrower, as referred to
    in Section 2.04.

              (b)  Each Borrowing shall be a Tranche A Borrowing
    or a Tranche B Borrowing and comprised of Alternate Base Rate
    Loans, Certificate of Deposit Loans or Eurodollar Loans as a
    Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03.  Each Bank may
    fulfill its Commitment with respect to any Eurodollar Loan or
    Certificate of Deposit Loan by causing, at its option, any
    domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Bank to make
    such Loan, provided that the exercise of such option shall
    not affect the obligation of such Borrower, to repay such
    Loan in accordance with the terms of the applicable Note. 
    Subject to the provisions of Section 2.03 and Section 2.10,
    Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the
    same time.

              (c)  Subject to Section 2.15, each Bank shall make
    its portion, as determined under Section 2.15, of each
    Borrowing to a Borrower hereunder on the proposed date
    thereof by paying the amount required to the Funds
    Administrator in Houston, Texas in immediately available
    funds not later than 1:00 p.m., Houston, Texas time, and,
    subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
    Article IV, the Funds Administrator shall promptly and in any
    event on the same day, credit the amounts so received to the
    general deposit account of such Borrower with the Funds
    Administrator, or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such
    date because any condition precedent herein specified shall
    not have been met, return the amounts so received to the
    respective Banks.  Loans of each Tranche shall be made by the
    Banks pro rata in accordance with Section 2.14.  Unless the
    Funds Administrator shall have received notice from a Bank
    prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not
    make available to the Funds Administrator such Bank's portion
    of such Borrowing, the Funds Administrator may assume that
    such Bank has made such portion available to the Funds
    Administrator on the date of such Borrowing in accordance
    with this paragraph (c) and the Funds Administrator may, in
    reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant
    Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the
    extent that such Bank shall not have made such portion
    available to the Funds Administrator, such Bank and such
    Borrower severally agree to repay to the Funds Administrator
    forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with
    interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
    made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is
    repaid to the Funds Administrator at (i) in the case of such
    Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the
    Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such
    Bank, the Federal Funds Effective Rate.  If such Bank shall
    repay to the Funds Administrator such corresponding amount,
    such amount shall constitute such Bank's Loan as part of such
    Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

         SECTION 2.03.  Notice of Borrowings.  (a) In order to
    effect a Borrowing, a Borrower shall give irrevocable written
    or telex notice (or irrevocable telephone notice thereof,
    confirmed as soon as practicable by written notice) to the
    Funds Administrator (a "Notice of Borrowing") (i) in the case
    of an Alternate Base Rate Loan, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
    Houston, Texas time, on the day of a proposed Borrowing, (ii)
    in the case of a Certificate of Deposit Loan, not later than
    10:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, two Business Days before a
    proposed Borrowing, and (iii) in the case of a Eurodollar
    Loan, not later than 10:00 a.m., Houston, Texas time, three
    Business Days before a proposed Borrowing.  Each Notice of
    Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall in each case refer
    to this Agreement and specify (i) the name of the Borrower,
    (ii) whether the Borrowing then being requested is a Tranche
    A Borrowing or a Tranche B Borrowing, (iii) whether the
    Borrowing then being requested is to be comprised of
    Alternate Base Rate Loans, Certificate of Deposit Loans or
    Eurodollar Loans, (iv) the date of such Borrowing (which
    shall be a Business Day) and amount thereof (which, in the
    case of a Borrowing to be comprised of Alternate Base Rate
    Loans, shall not be less than $5,000,000 and shall be in an
    integral multiple of $1,000,000, and which, in the case of a
    Borrowing to be comprised of Certificate of Deposit Loans or
    Eurodollar Loans, shall not be less than $25,000,000 and
    shall be in an integral multiple of $5,000,000) and (v) if
    such Borrowing is to be comprised of Certificate of Deposit
    Loans or Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period or Interest
    Periods with respect thereto.  If no election as to the Type
    of Loan is specified in any such notice by a Borrower, such
    Loan shall be an Alternate Base Rate Loan.  If no Interest
    Period with respect to any Borrowing comprised of Certificate
    of Deposit Loans or Eurodollar Loans is specified in any such
    notice by a Borrower, then in the case of a Borrowing
    comprised of Certificate of Deposit Loans, a Borrower shall
    be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of 30 days
    duration and in the case of a Borrowing comprised of
    Eurodollar Loans, a Borrower shall be deemed to have selected
    an Interest Period of one month's duration.  The Funds
    Administrator shall promptly advise the Administrative Agent
    and the Banks of any notice given by a Borrower pursuant to
    this Section 2.03(a) and of each Bank's portion of the
    requested Borrowing.

              (b)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
    in this Agreement, with respect to either Tranche, more than
    one Borrowing may occur on the same date.  For purposes of
    the foregoing, Borrowings comprised of Loans having different
    Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the
    same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.  Each
    Borrowing shall be comprised of Loans of the same Tranche.

         SECTION 2.04.  Notes; Repayment of Loans.  (a) The
    Tranche A Loans made by each Bank to a Borrower shall be
    evidenced by a note (a "Tranche A Note") duly executed on
    behalf of such Borrower, dated the Closing Date, in
    substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.04-A,
    payable to such Bank in a principal amount equal to its
    Tranche A Commitment on such date.  The Tranche B Loans made
    by each Bank to a Borrower shall be evidenced by a note (a
    "Tranche B Note") duly executed on behalf of such Borrower,
    dated the Closing Date, in substantially the form attached
    hereto as Exhibit 2.04-B, payable to such Bank in a principal
    amount equal to its Tranche B Commitment on such date.  The
    outstanding principal balance of each Tranche A Loan and
    Tranche B Loan, as evidenced by the relevant Note, shall be
    payable on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to
    such Loan or, if earlier, the Tranche A Maturity Date or the
    Tranche B Maturity Date, as applicable.  Each Note shall bear
    interest from its date on the outstanding principal balance
    thereof as provided in Section 2.05.

              (b)  Each Bank, the Administrative Agent or the
    Funds Administrator on its behalf, shall, and is hereby
    authorized by each Borrower to, endorse on the schedule
    attached to the relevant Notes delivered to such Bank (or a
    continuation of such schedule attached to such Notes and made
    a part thereof), or otherwise record in such Bank's internal
    records, an appropriate notation evidencing the date and
    amount of each Tranche A Loan or Tranche B Loan, as
    applicable from the Bank to a Borrower, as well as the date
    and amount of each payment and prepayment with respect
    thereto; provided, however, that the failure of any Bank, the
    Administrative Agent or the Funds Administrator to make such
    a notation or any error in such a notation shall not affect
    the obligation of a Borrower hereunder or under the Notes of
    such Bank to repay the principal amount of the Loans made by
    such Bank thereunder to such Bank together with all interest
    accruing thereon.

         SECTION 2.05.  Interest on Loans.  (a) Subject to the
    provisions of Section 2.08, each Alternate Base Rate Loan
    shall bear interest at a rate per annum, equal to the lesser
    of (i) the Highest Lawful Rate and (ii) the Alternate Base
    Rate (if the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate,
    computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
    over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be; if the
    Alternate Base Rate is based on the Base CD Rate or the
    Federal Funds Effective Rate, computed on the basis of the
    actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days).
    Interest on each Alternate Base Rate Loan shall be payable on
    each applicable Interest Payment Date.

              (b)  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08,
    each Certificate of Deposit Loan shall bear interest at a
    rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of
    days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the lesser of
    (i) the Highest Lawful Rate and (ii) the Adjusted CD Rate for
    the Interest Period in effect for such Loan plus 1/2 of 1%. 
    Interest on each Certificate of Deposit Loan shall be payable
    on each applicable Interest Payment Date.  The applicable
    Adjusted CD Rate shall be determined by the Funds
    Administrator, and such determination shall be conclusive
    absent demonstrable error.  The Funds Administrator shall
    promptly advise the Borrowers and each Bank of such
    determination.

              (c)  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08,
    each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum
    (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
    over a year of 360 days) equal to the lesser of (i) the
    Highest Lawful Rate and (ii) the LIBO Rate for the Interest
    Period in effect for such Loan plus 3/8 of 1%.  Interest on
    each Eurodollar Loan shall be payable on each applicable
    Interest Payment Date.  The LIBO Rate shall be determined by
    the Funds Administrator, and such determination shall be
    conclusive absent demonstrable error.  The Funds
    Administrator shall promptly advise the Borrowers and each
    Bank of such determination.

         SECTION 2.06.  Fees.  (a) Tandy shall pay each Bank,
    through the Funds Administrator, on the last day of each
    March, June, September and December, and on the Tranche A
    Maturity Date, in immediately available funds, a commitment
    fee (such Bank's "Tranche A Commitment Fee") of 1/10 of 1%
    per annum on the amount of the Tranche A Commitment of such
    Bank, whether used or unused, during the quarter (shorter
    period commencing with the Execution Date or ending with the
    Tranche A Maturity Date) ending on such date.  Tandy shall
    pay each Bank, through the Funds Administrator, on the last
    day of each March, June, September and December, and on the
    Tranche B Maturity Date, in immediately available funds, a
    commitment fee (such Bank's "Tranche B Commitment Fee") of
    3/20 of 1% per annum on the amount of the Tranche B
    Commitment of such Bank, whether used or unused, during the
    quarter (shorter period commencing with the Execution Date or
    ending with the Tranche B Maturity Date) ending on such date.
    All Commitmet Fees under this Section 2.06(a) shall be
    computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in
    a year of 360 days.  The Commitment Fee due to each Bank with
    respect to each Tranche shall cease to accrue on the earlier
    of the Tranche A Maturity Date or Tranche B Maturity Date, as
    the case may be, or the termination of the applicable Tranche
    A Commitment or Tranche B Commitment of such Bank pursuant to
    Section 2.07.

              (b)  Tandy shall pay to each Bank on the Execution
    Date a closing fee (the "Closing Fee") in an amount equal to
    1/20 of 1% times the sum of the Commitments of such Bank.

              (c)  Tandy shall pay the Administrative Agent, an
    agency fee (the "Agency Fee") in such amount as may be agreed
    between the Borrower and the Agent pursuant to that certain
    letter agreement of even date herewith between Tandy and the
    Administrative Agent (the "Agent's Letter").

              (d)  Tandy shall pay to TCB and Chemical Bank, for
    their own account, on or before the Execution Date all fees
    due to them pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated
    April 26, 1991 among Tandy, TCB-Dallas and Chemical Bank.

         SECTION 2.07.  Termination and Reduction of Commitments;
    Subsequent Increases of Commitments.  (a) Upon at least ten
    Business Days' prior written or telex notice to the Agents,
    the Borrowers may at any time in whole permanently terminate,
    or from time to time permanently reduce, the Total
    Commitment, ratably among the Banks in accordance with their
    respective Tranche A Commitment and Tranche B Commitment;
    provided, however, that any partial reduction of the Total
    Commitment shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount
    of $20,000,000.

              (b)  At the time the Commitments of any Bank are
    terminated or reduced pursuant to Section 2.07(a) or Section
    2.10(b) the Borrowers shall pay to the Funds Administrator
    for the account of each such Bank, the Commitment Fees on the
    amount of the Commitments so terminated or reduced owed
    through the date of such termination or reduction.

         SECTION 2.08.  Interest on Overdue Amounts.  If either
    Borrower shall default in the payment of the principal of or
    interest on any Loan or any other amount due hereunder, by
    acceleration or otherwise, such Borrower shall on demand from
    time to time pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on
    such defaulted amount up to (but not including) the date of
    actual payment (after as well as before judgment) at a rate
    per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
    elapsed over a period of 360 days) equal to the lesser of (a)
    the Highest Lawful Rate and (b) the Alternate Base Rate plus
    2% per annum.

         SECTION 2.09.  Alternate Rate of Interest.  (a) In the
    event, and on each occasion, that on the day two Business
    Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a
    Borrowing to be comprised of Eurodollar Loans, the Funds
    Administrator shall have determined (which determination
    shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that
    dollar deposits in the amount of the requested principal
    amount of such Borrowing are not generally available in the
    London Interbank Market, or that the rate at which dollar
    deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly
    reflect the cost to any Bank of making or maintaining the
    principal amount of its Eurodollar Loan comprising such
    Borrowing during such Interest Period, or reasonable means do
    not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate, the Funds
    Administrator shall as soon as practicable thereafter give
    written or telex notice of such determination to the
    Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and any
    request by a Borrower for the making of a Borrowing to be
    comprised of Eurodollar Loans shall, until the circumstances
    giving rise to such notice no longer exist, be deemed to be a
    request for a Borrowing to be comprised of Alternate Base
    Rate Loans or, if such Borrower shall so specify in its
    notice to the Funds Administrator, a request for a Borrowing
    to be comprised of Certificate of Deposit Loans so long as
    the circumstances giving rise to a notice under Section
    2.09(b) shall not exist.  Each determination of the Funds
    Administrator hereunder shall be conclusive absent
    demonstrable error.  In the event of such determination, the
    Borrower requesting such Borrowing shall have the right to
    withdraw its Notice of Borrowing requesting Eurodollar Loans.

         (b) In the event, and on each occasion, that on or before
    the day on which the Adjusted CD Rate for a Borrowing to be
    comprised of Certificate of Deposit Loans is to be
    determined, the Funds Administrator shall have determined
    (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
    Borrowers absent demonstrable error) that the Adjusted CD
    Rate for such Loan cannot be ascertained for any reason,
    including the inability or failure of the Funds Administrator
    to obtain sufficient bids in accordance with the terms of the
    definition of Fixed Certificate of Deposit Rate, or the Funds
    Administrator shall determine that the Adjusted CD Rate for
    the Certificate of Deposit Loans comprising such Borrowing
    will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Bank
    of making or maintaining the principal amount of its
    Certificate of Deposit Loan during such Interest Period, the
    Funds Administrator shall, as soon as practicable thereafter,
    give written or telex notice of such determination to the
    Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and any
    request by a Borrower for the making of a Borrowing to be
    comprised of Certificate of Deposit Loans shall, until the
    circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, be
    deemed to be a request for a Borrowing to be comprised of
    Alternate Base Rate Loans, or, if such Borrower shall so
    specify in its notice to the Funds Administrator, a request
    for a Borrowing to be comprised of Eurodollar Loans so long
    as the circumstances giving rise to a notice under Section
    2.09(a) shall not exist.  Each determination by the Funds
    Administrator hereunder shall be conclusive absent
    demonstrable error.  In the event of such determination, the
    Borrower requesting such Borrowing shall have the right to
    withdraw its Notice of Borrowing requesting Certificate of
    Deposit Loans.

         SECTION 2.10.  Prepayment of Loans.  (a) Each Borrowing
    may be prepaid at any time and from time to time, in whole or
    in part, subject to the requirements of Section 2.13 but
    otherwise without premium or penalty, upon at least five
    Business Days' prior written or telex notice to the Funds
    Administrator; provided, however, that each such partial
    prepayment shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and
    a minimum aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000.

              (b)  On the date of any termination or reduction of
    the Total Tranche A Commitment or the Total Tranche B
    Commitment pursuant to Section 2.07(a), each Borrower shall
    prepay so much of its Loans of such Tranche (up to the amount
    by which the Tranche A Commitment or the Tranche B
    Commitment, as the case may be, is so terminated or reduced)
    as shall be necessary in order that the aggregate principal
    amount of the Loans of such Tranche outstanding will not
    exceed the Tranche A Commitment or the Tranche B Commitment,
    as the case may be, following such termination or reduction.
    All prepayments under this paragraph shall be subject to
    Section 2.13.

              (c)  On any date when the aggregate principal
    amount of the outstanding Loans owed by TCC exceeds the
    lesser of (i) the Total Commitment and (ii) the then-current
    Borrowing Base, TCC shall make a mandatory prepayment of the
    Loans in such amount as may be necessary so that the
    aggregate amount of outstanding Loans of TCC after giving
    effect to such prepayment does not exceed the lesser of (i)
    the Total Commitment and (ii) the then-current Borrowing
    Base.  All prepayments under this paragraph shall be subject
    to Section 2.13.

              (d)  Each notice of prepayment shall specify the
    prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing
    (or portion thereof) to be prepaid, shall specify whether the
    Borrowing to be prepaid is a Tranche A Borrowing or a Tranche
    B Borrowing, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the
    Borrower making such prepayment to prepay such Loan by the
    amount stated therein on the date stated therein.  All
    prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the
    principal amount being prepaid to the date of prepayment.

         SECTION 2.11.  Reserve Requirements; Change in
    Circumstances.  (a) It is understood that the cost of each
    Bank of making or maintaining any of the Eurodollar Loans may
    fluctuate as a result of the applicability of reserve
    requirements imposed by the Board at the ratios provided for
    in Regulation D on the date hereof.  The Borrowers agree to
    pay to each of the Banks from time to time such amounts as
    shall be necessary to compensate such Bank for the portion of
    the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans resulting
    from any such reserve requirements provided for in Regulation
    D as in effect on the date hereof, it being understood that
    the rates of interest applicable to Eurodollar Loans have
    been determined on the assumption that no such reserve
    requirements exist or will exist and that such rates do not
    reflect costs imposed on the Banks in connection with such
    reserve requirements.

              (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if
    after the date of this Agreement any change in applicable law
    or regulation or in the interpretation or administration
    thereof by any governmental authority charged with the
    interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not
    having the force of law) shall change the basis of taxation
    of payments to any Bank of the principal of or interest on
    any Certificate of Deposit Loan or Eurodollar Loan made by
    such Bank or any other fees or amounts payable hereunder
    (other than taxes imposed on the overall net income of such
    Bank by the jurisdiction in which such Bank has its principal
    office or is located or by any political subdivision or
    taxing authority therein), or shall impose, modify or deem
    applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
    requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
    account of, or credit extended by, such Bank (except any such
    reserve requirement which is reflected in the Adjusted CD
    Rate) or shall impose on such Bank or the London Interbank
    Market any other condition affecting this Agreement or the
    Certificate of Deposit Loans or Eurodollar Loans made by such
    Bank and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to
    increase the cost to such Bank of making or maintaining any
    Certificate of Deposit Loan or Eurodollar Loan or to reduce
    the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank
    hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in
    respect thereof, by an amount deemed by such Bank in its sole
    discretion to be material, then such additional amount or
    amounts as will compensate such Bank for such additional
    costs or reduction will be paid to such Bank by each Borrower
    with respect to its Eurodollar Loans or Certificate of
    Deposit Loans, as applicable.

         (c)  If any Bank shall have determined that the
    applicability of any law, rule, regulation or guideline
    adopted pursuant to or arising out of the July 1988 report of
    the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory
    Practices entitled "International Convergence of Capital
    Measurement and Capital Standards," or the adoption after the
    date hereof of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline
    regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any of the
    foregoing or in the interpretation or administration of any
    of the foregoing by any governmental authority, central bank
    or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
    administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or any
    lending office of such Bank) or any Bank's holding company
    with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
    (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
    authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would
    have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's
    capital or on the capital of such Bank's holding company, if
    any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by
    such Bank pursuant hereto to a level below that which such
    Bank or such Bank's holding company could have achieved but
    for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
    consideration such Bank's policies and the policies of such
    Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by
    an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time
    to time Tandy shall pay to such Bank such additional amount
    or amounts as will compensate such Bank or such Bank's
    holding company for any such reduction suffered.  Without
    limitation of the foregoing and without prejudicing the
    rights of any Bank to claim compensation under this Section
    2.11(c) with respect to its Tranche B Loans, it is agreed
    that the interest rates and fees provided for in this
    Agreement have been determined on the understanding that the
    Banks will not be required to maintain capital against their
    Tranche A Commitments under currently applicable laws,
    regulations and regulatory guidelines, and that the Banks
    will be entitled to make claims under this paragraph in the
    event such understanding proves to be incorrect.

              (d)  A certificate of each Bank setting forth such
    amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such
    Bank (or participating banks or other entities pursuant to
    Article IX) as specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above
    shall be delivered to the Borrower obligated with respect
    thereto and shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. 
    Each Borrower shall pay each Bank the amount shown as due
    from it on any such certificate within 10 days after its
    receipt of the same.

      (e) Failure on the part of any Bank to demand compensation
    for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or
    receivable with respect to any Interest Period shall not
    constitute a waiver of such Bank's rights to demand
    compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts
    received or receivable in such Interest Period or in any
    other Interest Period.  The protection of this Section 2.11
    shall be available to each Bank regardless of any possible
    contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of any law,
    regulation or other condition which shall give rise to any
    demand by such Bank for compensation.

              (f)  Nothing in this Section 2.11 shall entitle any
    Bank to receive interest at a rate per annum in excess of the
    Highest Lawful Rate.

         SECTION 2.12.  Change in Legality.  (a) Notwithstanding
    anything to the contrary herein contained, if any change in
    any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any
    governmental authority charged with the administration or
    interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for any Bank to
    make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its
    obligations as contemplated hereby, then, by written notice
    to the Borrowers and to the Agents, such Bank may:

              (i)  declare that Eurodollar Loans will not
         thereafter be made by such Bank hereunder, whereupon any
         request by a Borrower for a Borrowing to be comprised of
         Eurodollar Loans shall, as to such Bank only, be deemed
         a request for an Alternate Base Rate Loan unless such
         declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

              (ii)  require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans
         made by it be converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans, in
         which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be
         automatically converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans as
         of the effective date of such notice as provided in
         paragraph (b) below.

    In the event any Bank shall exercise its rights under (i) or
    (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal which
    would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar
    Loans that would have been made by such Bank or the converted
    Eurodollar Loans of such Bank shall instead be applied to
    repay the Alternate Base Rate Loans made by such Bank in lieu
    of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar
    Loans; provided, however, the Alternate Base Rate Loans
    resulting from the conversion of such Eurodollar Loans shall
    be prepayable only at the times the converted Eurodollar
    Loans would have been prepayable, notwithstanding the
    provisions of Section 2.10(a).

              (b)  For purposes of Section 2.12(a), a notice to a
    Borrower by any Bank shall be effective as to each Eurodollar
    Loan, if lawful, on the last day of the then current Interest
    Period or, if there are then two or more current Interest
    Periods, on the last day of each such Interest Period,
    respectively; otherwise, such notice shall be effective on
    the date of receipt by such Borrower.

         SECTION 2.13.  Indemnity.  (a) Each Borrower shall
    indemnify each Bank against any loss or expense which such
    Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any failure
    by such Borrower to fulfill on the date of any Borrowing
    hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV,
    (b) any failure by such Borrower to borrow hereunder after
    delivery of a Notice of Borrowing or a notice of refinancing
    or continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.03, (c)
    any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Certificate of
    Deposit Loan or Eurodollar Loan required by any other
    provision of this Agreement or otherwise made on a date other
    than the last day of the applicable Interest Period, (d) any
    default in payment or prepayment of the principal amount of
    any Loan or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as
    and when due and payable (at the due date thereof, by
    irrevocable notice of prepayment or otherwise), or (e) the
    occurrence of any Event of Default, including, but not
    limited to, any loss or reasonable expense sustained or
    incurred or to be sustained or incurred in liquidating or
    employing deposits from third parties acquired to effect or
    maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a Certificate of
    Deposit Loan or Eurodollar Loan.  Such loss or reasonable
    expense shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any,
    as reasonably determined by each Bank of (i) its cost of
    obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid or
    converted or not borrowed (based on the Adjusted CD Rate or
    the LIBO Rate applicable thereto) for the period from the
    date of such payment, prepayment or conversion or failure to
    borrow to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan
    (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period
    for such Loan which would have commenced on the date of such
    failure to borrow) over (ii) the amount of interest (as
    reasonably determined by such Bank) that could be realized by
    such Bank in reemploying during such period the funds so
    paid, prepaid or converted or not borrowed.  A certificate of
    each Bank setting forth any amount or amounts which such Bank
    is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be
    delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent
    demonstrable error.  Nothing in this Section 2.13 shall
    entitle any Bank to receive interest at a rate per annum in
    excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.

              (c)  The provisions of this Section 2.13 shall
    remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
    the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the
    consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
    repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or
    unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement
    or any Note, or any investigation made by or on behalf of any
    Bank.  All amounts due under this Section 2.13 shall be
    payable on written demand therefor.

         SECTION 2.14.  Pro Rata Treatment.  Except as permitted
    under Section 2.11, Section 2.12 and Section 2.13, with
    respect to each Tranche, each Borrowing, each payment or
    prepayment of principal of the Notes of such Tranche, each
    payment of interest on such Notes, each other reduction of
    the principal or interest outstanding under such Notes,
    however achieved, each payment of the relevant Commitment
    Fees and each reduction of the relevant Commitments shall be
    made pro rata among the Banks in the proportions that their
    respective Tranche A Commitment or Tranche B Commitment bears
    to the Total Tranche A Commitment or Total Tranche B
    Commitment.

     SECTION 2.15.  Refinancings.  A Borrower may refinance all
    or any part of any Borrowing with a Borrowing of the same or
    a different Type made pursuant to Section 2.02, subject to
    the conditions and limitations set forth herein and elsewhere
    in this Agreement, including refinancings of Tranche A
    Borrowings with Tranche B Borrowings and Tranche B Borrowings
    with Tranche A Borrowings.  Any Borrowing or part thereof so
    refinanced shall be deemed to be repaid in accordance with
    Section 2.07 with the proceeds of a new Borrowing hereunder
    and the proceeds of the new Borrowing, to the extent they do
    not exceed the principal amount of the Borrowing being
    refinanced, shall not be paid by the Banks to the Funds
    Administrator or by the Funds Administrator to such Borrower
    pursuant to Section 2.02(c).

         SECTION 2.16.  Payments.  (a) The Borrowers shall make
    all payments (including principal of or interest on any
    Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder and under
    any other Loan Document not later than 1:00 p.m., Houston,
    Texas time, on the date when due in dollars to the Funds
    Administrator at its offices at 712 Main Street, Houston,
    Texas, in immediately available funds.

              (b)  Whenever any payment (including principal of
    or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts)
    hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become due,
    or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business
    Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business
    Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
    included in the computation of interest or Fees, if
    applicable.

         SECTION 2.17.  Sharing of Setoffs.  With respect to each
    Tranche, each Bank agrees that if it shall, in any manner,
    including through the exercise of a right of banker's lien,
    setoff or counterclaim against a Borrower, or pursuant to a
    secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United
    States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in
    lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Bank under any
    applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or
    otherwise, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in
    respect of a Note of such Borrower of such Tranche held by it
    as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of the Note
    of such Borrower of such Tranche held by it shall be
    proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the
    Note of such Borrower of such Tranche held by any other Bank,
    it shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased from such
    other Bank a participation in the Note of such Borrower of
    such Tranche held by such other Bank, so that the aggregate
    unpaid principal amount of the Notes of such Borrower and
    participations in Notes of such Borrower of such Tranche held
    by each Bank shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate
    unpaid principal amount of all Notes of such Borrower of such
    Tranche then outstanding as the principal amount of the Note
    of such Borrower of such Tranche held by it prior to such
    exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim was to the
    principal amount of all Notes of such Borrower outstanding
    prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or
    counterclaim; provided, however, that if any such purchase or
    purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this
    Section 2.17 and the payment giving rise thereto shall
    thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or
    adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery
    and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored
    without interest.  Each Borrower expressly consents to the
    foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Person holding a
    participation in a Note deemed to have been so purchased may
    exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or
    counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by each
    Borrower to such Bank as fully as if such Bank had made a
    Loan directly to each Borrower in the amount of such
    participation.

         SECTION 2.18.  Payments Free of Taxes.  (a) Any and all
    payments by a Borrower hereunder shall be made, in accordance
    with Section 2.02(c), free and clear of and without deduction
    for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
    deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
    respect thereto, excluding taxes imposed on either Agent's or
    any Bank's (or any transferee's or assignee's, including a
    participation holder's (any such entity a "Transferee") net
    income and franchise taxes imposed on either Agent or any
    Bank (or Transferee) by the United States or any jurisdiction
    under the laws of which it is organized or any political
    subdivision thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies,
    imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities
    being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").  If a Borrower
    shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in
    respect of any sum payable hereunder to the Banks (or any
    Transferee or either Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be
    increased by the amount necessary so that after making all
    required deductions (including deductions applicable to
    additional sums payable under this Section 2.18) such Bank
    (or Transferee) or such Agent (as the case may be) shall
    receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
    no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make
    such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full
    amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other
    governmental authority in accordance with applicable law.

              (b)  In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any
    present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other
    excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which
    arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
    delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to,
    this Agreement or any other Loan Document (hereinafter
    referred to as "Other Taxes").

              (c)  Each Borrower will indemnify each Bank (or
    Transferee) and each Agent for the full amount of Taxes and
    Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by
    any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.18)
    paid by such Bank (or Transferee or such Agent, as the case
    may be, and any liability (including penalties, interest and
    expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether
    or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
    asserted by the relevant taxing authority or other
    governmental authority.  Such indemnification shall be made
    within 30 days after the date any Bank (or Transferee) or
    either Agent, as the case may be, makes written demand
    therefor.  If a Bank (or Transferee) or an Agent shall become
    aware that it is entitled to receive a refund in respect of
    Taxes or Other Taxes, it shall promptly notify the applicable
    Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall, within
    30 days after receipt of a request by such Borrower, apply
    for such refund at such Borrower's expense.  If any Bank (or
    Transferee) or the Funds Administrator receives a refund in
    respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes for which such Bank (or
    Transferee) or the Funds Administrator has received payment
    from a Borrower hereunder it shall promptly notify such
    Borrower of such refund and shall, within 30 days after
    receipt of a request by such Borrower (or promptly upon
    receipt, if such Borrower has requested application for such
    refund pursuant hereto), repay such refund to such Borrower,
    net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Bank and without
    interest; provided that such Borrower, upon the request of
    such Bank (or Transferee) or the Funds Administrator, agrees
    to return such refund (plus penalties, interest or other
    charges) to such Bank (or Transferee) or the Funds
    Administrator in the event such Bank (or Transferee) or the
    Funds Administrator is required to repay such refund.

              (d)  Within 30 days after the date of any payment
    of Taxes or Other Taxes withheld by a Borrower in respect of
    any payment to any Bank (or Transferee) or the Funds
    Administrator, such Borrower will furnish to the Funds
    Administrator, at its address referred to in Section 9.01,
    the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
    payment thereof.

              (e)  Without prejudice to the survival of any other
    agreement contained herein, the agreements and obligations
    contained in this Section 2.18 shall survive the payment in
    full of the principal of and interest on all Loans made
    hereunder.

              (f)  Each Bank (or Transferee) which is organized
    outside the United States shall promptly notify the Borrowers
    of any changes in its funding office and upon written request
    of the Borrowers shall, prior to the immediately following
    due date of any payment by a Borrower hereunder, deliver to
    the Borrowers such certificates, documents or other evidence,
    as required by the Code or Treasury Regulations issued
    pursuant thereto, including Internal Revenue Service Form
    1001 or Form 4224 and any other certificate or statement of
    exemption required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(a)
    or Section 1.1441-6(c) or any subsequent version thereof,
    properly completed and duly executed by such Bank (or
    Transferee) establishing that such payment is (i) not subject
    to withholding under the Code because such payment is
    effectively connected with the conduct by such Bank (or
    Transferee) of a trade or business in the United States or
    (ii) totally exempt from United States tax under a provision
    of an applicable tax treaty.  Unless the Borrowers and the
    Funds Administrator have received forms or other documents
    satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder or
    under the Notes are not subject to United States withholding
    tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by an
    applicable tax treaty, the Borrowers or the Funds
    Administrator shall withhold taxes from such payments at the
    applicable statutory rate in the case of payments to or for
    any Bank (or Transferee) or assignee organized under the laws
    of a jurisdiction outside the United States.

              (g)  No Borrower shall be required to pay any
    additional amounts to any Bank (or Transferee) in respect of
    United States withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) above
    if the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not
    have arisen but for a failure by such Bank (or Transferee) to
    comply with the provisions of paragraph (f) above unless such
    failure results from (i) a change in applicable law,
    regulation or official interpretation thereof or (ii) an
    amendment, modification or revocation of any applicable tax
    treaty or a change in official position regarding the
    application or interpretation thereof, in each case after the
    Closing Date (and, in the case of a Transferee, after the
    date of assignment or transfer).

              (h)  Any Bank (or Transferee) claiming any
    additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.18
    shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and
    regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document
    requested by a Borrower or to change the jurisdiction of its
    applicable lending office if the making of such a filing or
    change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any
    such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue and would
    not, in the sole determination of such Bank, be otherwise
    disadvantageous to such Bank (or Transferee).

              (i)  If any Bank (or Transferee) requests
    compensation pursuant to this Section 2.18 hereof, the
    Borrowers may give notice to such Bank (with a copy to the
    Agents) that it wishes to seek one or more Eligible Assignees
    (which may be one or more of the Banks) to assume the
    Commitments of such Bank and to purchase its outstanding
    Loans and Notes.  Each Bank (or Transferee) requesting
    compensation pursuant to Section 2.18 hereto agrees to sell
    all of its Commitments, its Loans and its Notes pursuant to
    Section 9.03 to any such Eligible Assignee for an amount
    equal to the sum of the outstanding unpaid principal of and
    accrued interest on such Loans and Notes plus all Commitment
    Fees and other fees and amounts due such Bank (or Transferee)
    hereunder calculated, in each case, to the date such
    Commitments, Loans and Notes are purchased, whereupon such
    Bank (or Transferee) shall have no further Commitments or
    other obligation to either Borrower hereunder or under any
    Note.

         SECTION 2.19.  Classification Downgrade.  In the event
    the facilities available under this Agreement or any Loan or
    the Notes shall be classified as a "highly leveraged
    transaction" in accordance with published United States
    regulations (an "HLT Classification") by (a) either Agent or
    (b) any United States governmental authority with supervisory
    responsibility over either Agent or any of the Banks, either
    Agent or any of the Banks so advised shall forthwith notify
    the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (who shall
    forthwith notify each of the Banks and the other Agent). 
    Upon receipt of such notification, the Borrowers and the
    Agents shall forthwith commence discussions and in good faith
    negotiate revisions to this Agreement (including interest
    rate, fees, term, covenants, representations and any other
    items deemed relevant) so as to reflect market terms and
    conditions then offered for facilities reasonably similar in
    type, term and amount to that under this Agreement and
    similarly classified.  Any such revisions shall be subject to
    the approval of the Agents and the Required Banks.  If the
    Borrowers and the Required Banks shall fail to agree on such
    an increase within 90 days after notice of such HLT
    Classification is given to the Agents and the Banks as
    provided above, then (i) the Administrative Agent shall, if
    requested by the Required Banks, by notice to the Borrowers,
    immediately terminate the Commitments of the Banks, and (ii)
    upon such termination, the Borrowers shall prepay the Loans
    outstanding hereunder in full, together with any interest
    accrued thereon to the date of such prepayment and any
    amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof in connection
    therewith.  The Banks acknowledge that (without prejudice to
    the preceding sentence) an HLT Classification shall not per
    se constitute a Default or an Event of Default hereunder.


                             ARTICLE III

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Each Borrower represents and warrants as to itself and
    Tandy represents and warrants as to each of its Subsidiaries
    that:

         SECTION 3.01.  Organization, Corporate Powers.  Each
    Borrower and each of its Significant Subsidiaries is duly
    organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
    laws of the state of its incorporation or organization, has
    the requisite power and authority to own its property and
    assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and is
    qualified to do business in every jurisdiction where such
    qualification is required, except where the failure so to
    qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the
    condition, financial or otherwise, of Tandy or TCC.  Each of
    Tandy and TCC has the corporate power to execute, deliver and
    perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other
    Loan Documents to which it is a party, to borrow hereunder,
    to execute and deliver the Notes to which it is a party and
    to comply with the terms of the Operating Agreement and the
    Support Agreement.  TCC does not and will not have any
    Subsidiaries other than TRC.

         SECTION 3.02.  Authorization.  The execution, delivery
    and performance of this Agreement, the Operating Agreement
    and the Support Agreement, the borrowings hereunder, and the
    execution and delivery of the Notes by the Borrowers and the
    Tandy Guaranty by Tandy (a) have been duly authorized by all
    requisite corporate and, if required, stockholder action on
    the part of the Borrowers and (b) will not (i) violate (A)
    any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation or the
    certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of either
    Borrower, (B) any order of any court, or any rule, regulation
    or order of any other agency of government binding upon
    either Borrower or (C) any provisions of any indenture,
    agreement or other instrument to which either Borrower is a
    party, or by which either Borrower or Tandy or any of its
    properties or assets are or may be bound, (ii) be in conflict
    with, result in a breach of or constitute (alone or with
    notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any
    indenture, agreement or other instrument referred to in
    (b)(i)(C) above or (iii) result in the creation or imposition
    of any lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever
    upon any property or assets of either Borrower.

         SECTION 3.03.  Governmental Approval.  No registration
    with or consent or approval of, or other action by, any
    federal, state or other governmental agency, authority or
    regulatory body is or will be required in connection with the
    execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the
    execution and delivery of the Notes, the Borrowings hereunder
    or the performance of the Operating Agreement and the Support
    Agreement by either Borrower.

         SECTION 3.04.  Enforceability.  This Agreement, the
    Operating Agreement and the Support Agreement have been duly
    executed and delivered by the Borrowers and constitute legal,
    valid and binding obligations of the Borrowers, and the Notes
    and the Tandy Guaranty, when duly executed and delivered by
    the Borrower signatory thereto, will constitute legal, valid
    and binding obligations of such Borrower, in each case
    enforceable in accordance with their respective terms
    (subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable
    bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and
    similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally).

         SECTION 3.05.  Financial Statements.  (a) The audited
    consolidated financial statements of Tandy and TCC, in each
    case, as at June 30, 1990, copies of which have been
    furnished to the Banks, have been prepared in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
    consistent with that of the preceding fiscal year, and
    present fairly the financial conditions of Tandy and its
    Subsidiaries and TCC, respectively, as at such date and the
    results of their operations for the period then ended.

              (b)  The Forms 10-Q of Tandy and TCC, in each case,
    as at each of December 31, 1990 and March 31, 1991, copies of
    which have been furnished to the Banks, have been prepared in
    accordance with all applicable rules, regulations and
    guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
    present fairly the financial condition of Tandy and its
    Subsidiaries and TCC, respectively, as at such dates and the
    results of their operations for the periods then ended,
    subject to year-end audit adjustments.

         SECTION 3.06.  No Material Adverse Change.  There has
    been no material adverse change in the businesses, assets,
    operations, prospects or condition, financial or otherwise,
    of Tandy or TCC since June 30, 1990.

         SECTION 3.07.  Title to Properties.  Each of Tandy and
    TCC has good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold
    interests in, all its properties and assets, except for such
    properties as are no longer used or useful in the conduct of
    its businesses or as have been disposed of in the ordinary
    course of business and except for minor defects in title that
    do not interfere with the ability of Tandy or TCC to conduct
    its business as now conducted.

         SECTION 3.08.  Litigation; Compliance with Laws; etc.
    (a) There are not any actions, suits or proceedings at law or
    in equity or by or before any governmental instrumentality or
    other agency or regulatory authority now pending or, to the
    knowledge of Tandy or TCC, threatened against or affecting
    Tandy or TCC or any other Subsidiary of Tandy or the
    businesses, assets or rights of Tandy or TCC or any other
    Subsidiary of Tandy (i) which involve this Agreement, the
    Operating Agreement or the Support Agreement or any of the
    transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or (ii) as to
    which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
    determination and which, if adversely determined, could,
    individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the
    ability of Tandy or TCC to conduct business substantially as
    now conducted, or materially and adversely affect the
    businesses, assets, operations, prospects or condition,
    financial or otherwise, of Tandy or TCC, or impair the
    validity or enforceability of or the ability of Tandy or TCC
    to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the
    Operating Agreement, the Support Agreement or any of the
    Notes or other Loan Documents.

              (b)  Neither Tandy nor TCC is in violation of any
    law, the breach or consequence of which would materially and
    adversely affect the ability of Tandy or TCC to carry on its
    business, or in default under any material order, writ,
    injunction, award or decree of any court, arbitrator,
    administrative agency or other governmental authority binding
    upon it or its assets or any material indenture, mortgage,
    contract, agreement or other undertaking or instrument to
    which it is a party or by which any of its properties may be
    bound, and nothing has occurred which would materially and
    adversely affect the ability of Tandy or TCC to carry on its
    business or perform its obligations under any such order,
    writ, injunction, award or decree or any such material
    indenture, mortgage, contract, agreement or other undertaking
    or instrument.

         SECTION 3.09.  Agreements; No Default.  (a) Neither
    Tandy nor TCC is a party to any agreement or instrument or
    subject to any corporate restriction that has a present
    material and adverse effect on the business, properties,
    assets, operations, prospects or condition, financial or
    otherwise, of Tandy or TCC, respectively.

              (b)  Neither Tandy nor TCC is in default in any
    manner that would materially and adversely affect the
    business, properties, assets, operations, prospects or
    condition, financial or otherwise, of Tandy or TCC or the
    performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the
    obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any
    material agreement or instrument to which it is a party.

              (c)  Neither Tandy nor any of its Subsidiaries is
    in default under any agreement or instrument to which Tandy
    or any Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their
    respective properties or assets is bound or affected, which
    default might materially and adversely affect the financial
    condition or operations of Tandy and its Subsidiaries taken
    as a whole.  No Event of Default has occurred and is
    continuing.

         SECTION 3.10.  Federal Reserve Regulations.

              (a)  Neither Tandy nor TCC is engaged principally,
    or as one of its important activities, in the business of
    extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
    Margin Stock.

              (b)  No part of the proceeds of the Loans will be
    used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether
    immediately, incidentally or ultimately, (i) to purchase or
    carry Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for the
    purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock or to refund
    indebtedness originally incurred for such purpose, or (ii)
    for any purpose which entails a violation of, or which is
    inconsistent with, the provisions of the Regulations of the
    Board, including Regulations G, T, U or X; provided, however,
    Tandy may acquire Margin Stock if, upon the acquisition of
    such Margin Stock, 25% or less of Tandy's total assets
    subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 6.01 would
    then be composed of Margin Stock, and furnish to the
    Administrative Agent upon its request, a statement in
    conformity with the requirements of Federal Reserve Form U-1
    referred to in Regulation U.

         SECTION 3.11.  Taxes.  Each Borrower and each of its
    Subsidiaries has filed all tax returns which are required to
    have been filed and has paid, or made adequate provisions for
    the payment of, all of its taxes which are due and payable,
    except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good
    faith and by appropriate proceedings and as to which such
    reserves or other appropriate provisions as may be required
    by generally accepted accounting principles have been
    maintained.  The federal income tax liability of Tandy and
    its Subsidiaries has been audited by the Internal Revenue
    Service and has been finally determined and satisfied (or the
    time for audit has expired) for all tax years up to and
    including the tax year ended June 30, 1979.  Tandy deems the
    amounts and maximum final judgments from such action to be
    immaterial to Tandy.  Neither Borrower is aware of any
    proposed assessment against it or any of its Subsidiaries for
    additional taxes (or any basis for any such assessment) which
    might be material to either Borrower and its Subsidiaries
    taken as a whole.

         SECTION 3.12.  Pension and Welfare Plans.  Each Plan
    complies in all material respects with all applicable
    statutes and governmental rules and regulations, and: (a) no
    Reportable Event has occurred and is continuing with respect
    to any Plan, (b) neither Tandy, TCC nor any ERISA Affiliate
    has withdrawn from any Plan or instituted steps to do so, and
    (c) except as listed on Exhibit 3.12, no steps have been
    instituted to terminate any Plan.  No condition exists or
    event or transaction has occurred in connection with any Plan
    which could result in the incurrence by Tandy, TCC or any
    ERISA Affiliate of any material liability, fine or penalty. 
    Neither Tandy, TCC nor any ERISA Affiliate is a member of, or
    contributes to, any multiple employer Plan as described in
    section 4064 of ERISA.  Neither Borrower nor any of its
    Subsidiaries has any contingent liability with respect to any
    post-retirement "welfare benefit plans," as such term is
    defined in ERISA.

         SECTION 3.13.  No Material Misstatements.  Neither this
    Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Confidential
    Information Memorandum nor any other document delivered by or
    on behalf of Tandy or any of its Affiliates (including each
    Borrower's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 1990 and each
    Borrower's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three fiscal
    quarters ended at March 31, 1991) in connection with any Loan
    Document or included therein contained or contains any
    material misstatement of fact or omitted or omits to state
    any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
    in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
    not misleading.

         SECTION 3.14.  Investment Company Act; Public Utility
    Holding Company Act.  Neither Tandy nor TCC is an "investment
    company" or a company "controlled" by an investment company
    as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment
    Company Act of 1940.  Neither Tandy nor TCC is a "holding
    company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
    Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

         SECTION 3.15.  Business; Liabilities of TCC.  TCC has
    conducted no business other than the purchase, service and
    collection of accounts receivable under the Operating
    Agreement and, in September 1987, the one time purchase of
    existing Radio Shack customer accounts created under an
    agreement with Citibank, N.A.

         SECTION 3.16.  Compliance with Laws.  To the best
    knowledge of each Borrower, after due investigation, each
    Borrower and its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with
    all statutes and governmental rules and regulations
    applicable to them.

         SECTION 3.17.  Maintenance of Insurance.  Each Borrower
    maintains, and causes each of its Subsidiaries to maintain,
    insurance to such extent and against such hazards and
    liabilities as is commonly maintained by companies similarly
    situated.

         SECTION 3.18.  Existing Liens.  None of the assets of
    either Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
    Lien, except:

              (a)  Liens for current taxes not delinquent or
         taxes being contested in good faith and by appropriate
         proceedings and as to which such reserves or other
         appropriate provisions as may be required by generally
         accepted accounting principles are being maintained;

              (b)  carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics',
         materialmen's and other like statutory Liens arising in
         the ordinary course of business securing obligations
         which are not overdue for a period of more than 90 days
         or which are being contested in good faith and by
         appropriate proceedings and as to which such reserves or
         other appropriate provisions as may be required by
         generally accepted accounting principles are being
         maintained;

              (c)  pledges or deposits in connection with
         workers' compensation, unemployment insurance and other
         social security legislation;

              (d)  deposits to secure the performance of bids,
         trade contracts, leases, statutory obligations, and
         other obligations of a like nature incurred in the
         ordinary course of business, and Liens securing
         reimbursement obligations created by open letters of
         credit for the purchase of inventory;

              (e)  Liens granted by a Subsidiary of Tandy (other
         than TCC and TRC) to secure such Subsidiary's
         Indebtedness to Tandy or to any other Subsidiary of
         Tandy;

              (f)  Liens granted by TRC to the Tandy Master Trust
         to secure TRC's Indebtedness to the Tandy Master Trust;

              (g)  Liens, if any, disclosed in the financial
         statements referred to in Section 3.05; and

              (h)  Liens listed on Exhibit 3.18.

         SECTION 3.19.  Environmental Matters.  Each Borrower and
    each of its Subsidiaries has complied in all material
    respects with all federal, state, local and other statutes,
    ordinances, orders, judgments, rulings and regulations
    relating to environmental pollution or to environmental
    regulation or control.  Neither Borrower nor any of its
    Subsidiaries have received notice of any failure so to comply
    which alone or together with any other such failure could
    result in a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
    operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise)
    of such Borrower or such Subsidiary.  None of the facilities
    of either Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries manage any
    hazardous wastes, hazardous substances, hazardous materials,

              (d)  purchase or otherwise acquire all or
         substantially all the assets of any Person.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing:

              (u)  TCC may sell all or substantially all of its
         Accounts (including "Customer Obligations" as defined in
         the Operating Agreement) for reasonably equivalent value
         to TRC;

              (v)  TRC may transfer and assign all of its right,
         title and interest in its credit card receivables to
         the Tandy Master Trust pursuant to one or more pooling
         and servicing agreements;

              (w)  any Subsidiary (other than TCC) may merge into
         Tandy or into or with any Wholly-owned Subsidiary so
         long as Tandy or such Wholly-owned Subsidiary, as the
         case may be, shall be the surviving entity, provided,
         however, TRC may not merge into TCC;

              (x)  any Subsidiary (other than TCC) may sell,
         transfer, convey, lease or assign all or a substantial
         part of its assets to Tandy or any Wholly-owned
         Subsidiary;

              (y)  any Person (other than TCC) may merge into
         Tandy and Tandy may acquire all or substantially all the
         assets of any Person; and

              (z)  Tandy and any of its Subsidiaries (other than
         TCC) may in the ordinary course of its business sell,
         transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or
         any substantial part of the assets of Tandy and its
         Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

    provided, in each of the cases described in the preceding
    clauses (u), (v), (w), (x), (y) and (z), that immediately
    thereafter and after giving effect thereto:

         For purposes of this Section 6.03 only, a sale,
    transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets
    shall be deemed to be a "substantial part" of the assets of
    Tandy and its Subsidiaries only if the value of such assets,
    when added to the value of all other assets sold,
    transferred, conveyed, leased or otherwise disposed of by
    Tandy and its Subsidiaries (other than (i) pursuant to
    clauses (x) and (z) of this Section 6.03) during the same
    fiscal year, exceeds 15% of Tandy's consolidated total assets
    determined as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal
    year.  As used in the preceding sentence, the term "value"
    shall mean, with respect to any asset disposed of, the
    greater of such asset's book or fair market value as of the
    date of disposition, with "book value" being the value of
    such asset as would appear immediately prior to such
    disposition on a balance sheet of the owner of such asset
    prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles.

         SECTION 6.04.  Disposition of Accounts.  TCC will not
    sell, transfer, discount or otherwise dispose of any Accounts
    unless such sale or other disposition shall be without
    recourse to TCC except (a) to the extent of breaches of
    customary representations and warranties on sale that do not
    relate in any way to creditworthiness of any obligor on such
    receivables or the collectibility or payment thereof, (b) as
    permitted by the Operating Agreement and (c) as permitted by
    Section 6.03.

    of all Investments of TCC in TRC to be less at any time than
    15% of the aggregate principal amount of its Indebtedness.

         SECTION 6.06.  Indebtedness.  TCC will not incur,
    create, assume or permit to exist any Indebtedness other than
    Permitted Indebtedness.

         recognized credit rating agency;

              (f)  Investments in United States dollar

    or otherwise dispose of any shares of its capital stock or
    any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such
    shares, or any warrants, options, or other rights to

    the contrary.

         SECTION 6.11.  Other Agreements.  The Borrowers will
    not, and will not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries

    would be violated or breached by such Borrower's performance

    document delivered or to be delivered by such Borrower
    hereunder or in connection herewith.

         SECTION 6.12.  Fiscal Year; Accounting.  Neither
    Borrower will change its fiscal year or method of accounting
    (other than immaterial changes and methods and changes

         assumed responsibility in writing or for and to the
         extent which the Borrowers or any such Subsidiary is
         otherwise indemnified if the terms of such
         indemnification are satisfactory to the Required Banks;

    then, and in any such event (other than an event with respect
    to either Borrower described in paragraph (f) or (g) above),

    event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of
    the Required Banks shall, by written or telegraphic notice to

    any event with respect to either Borrower described in
    paragraph (f) or (g) above, the Commitments of the Banks
    shall automatically terminate (if not theretofore terminated)
    and the Notes shall automatically become due and payable,
    both as to principal and interest, without presentment,
    demand, protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of
    acceleration or other notice of any kind, all of which are
    hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers, anything contained
    herein or in any Note to the contrary notwithstanding.


                           ARTICLE VIII

                            THE AGENTS

         SECTION 8.01.  Authorization and Action.  In order to
    expedite the various transactions contemplated by this
    Agreement, each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and
    authorizes TCB-Dallas to act as Administrative Agent and TCB
    to act as Funds Administrator on its behalf.  Each of the
    Banks, and each subsequent holder of any Note by its
    acceptance thereof, hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs
    the Agents to take such action on behalf of such Bank or
    holder under the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
    to exercise such powers hereunder as are specifically
    delegated to or required of the Agents by the terms and
    provisions hereof, together with such powers as are
    reasonably incidental thereto.  The Agents are hereby
    expressly authorized on behalf of the Banks, without hereby
    limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of
    each of the Banks any payment of principal of or interest on
    the Notes outstanding hereunder and all other amounts accrued
    hereunder paid to the Agents, and promptly to distribute to
    each Bank its proper share of all payments so received; (b)
    to give notice within a reasonable time on behalf of each of
    the Banks to the Borrowers of any Default or Event of Default
    specified in this Agreement of which the Agents have actual
    knowledge as provided in Section 8.08; (c) to distribute to
    each Bank copies of all notices, agreements and other
    material as provided for in this Agreement as received by
    such Agents; and (d) to distribute to the Borrowers any and
    all requests, demands and approvals received by the Agents or
    from the Banks.

         SECTION 8.02.  Agent's Reliance, etc.  Neither the
    Administrative Agent, the Funds Administrator nor any of its
    directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable as
    such for any action taken or omitted by any of them hereunder
    except for its or his own gross negligence or willful
    misconduct (it being the express intention of the parties
    that the Administrative Agent and the Funds Administrator and
    their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
    shall have no liability for actions and omissions hereunder
    resulting from their ordinary sole or contributory
    negligence), or be responsible for any statement, warranty or
    representation herein or the contents of any document
    delivered in connection herewith or be required to ascertain
    or to make any inquiry concerning the performance or
    observance by the Borrowers of any of the terms, conditions,
    covenants or agreements of this Agreement or any other Loan
    Document.  Neither Agent shall be responsible to the Banks or
    the holders of the Notes for the due execution, genuineness,
    validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this Agreement,
    the Notes, any other Loan Document or any other instrument to
    which reference is made herein.  The Agents may deem and
    treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all
    purposes hereof until it shall have received from the payee
    of such Note notice, given as provided herein, of the
    transfer thereof.  The Agents shall in all cases be fully
    protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in accordance
    with written instructions signed by the Required Banks, and,
    except as otherwise specifically provided herein, such
    instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
    thereto shall be binding on all the Banks.  The Agents shall,
    in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to
    rely on any paper or document believed by them in good faith
    to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by
    the proper person or persons.  Neither Agent nor any of its
    directors, officers, employees or agents shall have any
    responsibility to the Borrowers on account of the failure or
    delay in performance or breach by any Bank of any of its
    obligations hereunder or to any Bank on account of the
    failure of or delay in performance or breach by any other
    Bank or the Borrowers of any of their respective obligations
    hereunder or in connection herewith.  The Agents may execute
    any and all duties hereunder by or through agents or
    employees and shall be entitled to advice of legal counsel
    selected by it with respect to all matters arising hereunder
    and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in
    good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such
    counsel.

         The Banks hereby acknowledge that the Agents shall be
    under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to
    be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
    unless an Agent shall be requested in writing to do so by the
    Required Banks.

         SECTION 8.03.  Agent and Affiliates: TCB, TCB-Dallas and
    Affiliates.  Without limiting the right of any other Bank to
    engage in any business transactions with either Borrower or
    any of its Affiliates, with respect to their Commitments, the
    Loans, if any, made by them and the Notes, if any, issued to
    them, TCB-Dallas and, to the extent it becomes the holder of
    any Note hereunder, TCB shall have the same rights and powers
    under this Agreement, any Note or any of the other Loan
    Documents as any other Bank and may exercise the same as
    though it were not respectively the Administrative Agent and
    the Funds Administrator; and the term "Bank" or "Banks"
    shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include
    TCB-Dallas and, to the extent TCB becomes the holder of any
    Note, TCB, in its individual capacity.  TCB, TCB-Dallas and
    their respective Affiliates may be engaged in, or may
    hereafter engage in, one or more loan, letter of credit,
    leasing or other financing activities not the subject of the
    Loan Documents (collectively, the "Other Financings") with
    either Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or may act as
    trustee on behalf of, or depositary for, or otherwise engage
    in other business transactions with either Borrower or any of
    its Affiliates (all Other Financings and other such business
    transactions being collectively, the "Other Activities") with
    no responsibility to account therefor to the Banks.  Without
    limiting the rights and remedies of the Banks specifically
    set forth in the Loan Documents, no other Bank shall have any
    interest in (a) any Other Activities, (b) any present or
    future guarantee by or for the account of either Borrower not
    contemplated or included in the Loan Documents, (c) any
    present or future offset exercised by either Agent in respect
    of any such Other Activities, (d) any present or future
    property taken as security for any such Other Activities or
    (e) any property now or hereafter in the possession or
    control of either Agent which may be or become security for
    the obligations of either Borrower under the Loan Documents
    by reason of the general description of indebtedness secured,
    or of property contained in any other agreements, documents
    or instruments related to such Other Activities; provided,
    however, that if any payment in respect of such guarantees or
    such property or the proceeds thereof shall be applied to
    reduction of the obligations evidenced hereunder and by the
    Notes, then each Bank shall be entitled to share in such
    application according to its pro rata portion of such
    obligations.

         SECTION 8.04.  Agents Indemnity.  Each Bank agrees (a)
    to reimburse the Agents, on demand, in the amount of such
    Bank's pro rata share (based on its Commitments hereunder) of
    any expenses incurred for the benefit of the Banks by either
    Agent, including counsel fees and compensation of agents and
    employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Banks,
    not reimbursed by the Borrowers and (b) to indemnify and hold
    harmless each Agent and any of its directors, officers,
    employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of its pro rata
    share, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
    losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
    expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
    which may be imposed on, incurred by, asserted against such
    Agent in its capacity as an Agent or any of them in any way
    relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action
    taken or omitted by such Agent or any of them under this
    Agreement, to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers;
    provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable to an Agent
    for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
    damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
    expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence
    or willful misconduct of such Agent or any of its directors,
    officers, employees or agents.  Each Bank agrees, however,
    that it expressly intends, under this Section 8.04, to
    indemnify each Agent as aforesaid for all such liabilities,
    obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
    suits, costs, expenses and disbursements resulting from such
    Agent's ordinary sole or contributory negligence.

         SECTION 8.05.  Bank Credit Decision.  Each Bank
    acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
    upon either Agent or any other Bank and based on such
    documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
    its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
    Agreement.  Each Bank also acknowledges that it will,
    independently and without reliance upon either Agent or any
    other Bank and based on such documents and information as it
    shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
    decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon
    this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any related
    agreement or any document furnished hereunder.

         SECTION 8.06.  Successor Administrative Agent. Subject
    to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
    Administrative Agent as provided herein, the Administrative
    Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
    to the Funds Administrator, the Banks and the Borrowers. 
    Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks shall have the
    right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent.  If no
    successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed
    by the Required Banks, and shall have accepted such
    appointment, within 30 calendar days after the retiring
    Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then
    the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
    Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall
    be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of
    the United States or of any state thereof and having a
    combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.  Upon
    the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
    hereunder and under the Notes by a successor Administrative
    Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon
    succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
    privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent,
    and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
    from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the
    Notes.  After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
    as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the Notes, the
    provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.04 shall inure
    to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
    by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement
    and the Notes.

         SECTION 8.07.  Successor Funds Administrator.  Subject
    to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Funds
    Administrator as provided herein, the Funds Administrator may
    resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the
    Administrative Agent, the Banks and the Borrowers.  Upon any
    such resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to
    appoint a successor Funds Administrator.  If no successor
    Funds Administrator shall have been so appointed by the
    Required Banks, and shall have accepted such appointment,
    within 30 calendar days after the retiring Funds
    Administrator's giving of notice of resignation, then the
    retiring Funds Administrator may, on behalf of the Banks,
    appoint a successor Funds Administrator, which shall be a
    commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the
    United States or of any state thereof and having a combined
    capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.  Upon the
    acceptance of any appointment as Funds Administrator
    hereunder and under the Notes by a successor Funds
    Administrator, such successor Funds Administrator shall
    thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
    powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Funds
    Administrator, and the retiring Funds Administrator shall be
    discharged from its duties and obligations under this
    Agreement and the Notes.  After any retiring Funds
    Administrator's resignation as Funds Administrator hereunder
    and under the Notes, the provisions of this Article VIII and
    Section 9.04 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
    taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Funds
    Administrator under this Agreement and the Notes.

         SECTION 8.08.  Notice of Default.  Neither Agent shall
    be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of
    any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless such Agent
    shall have received notice from a Bank or a Borrower
    referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event
    of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
    default" or "notice of event of default", as applicable.  If
    an Agent receives such a notice, such Agent shall give notice
    thereof to the Banks and, if such notice is received from a
    Bank, such Agent shall give notice thereof to the other
    Agent, the other Banks and the Borrowers.  The Agent shall be
    entitled to take action or refrain from taking action with
    respect to such Default or Event of Default as provided in
    Section 8.01 and Section 8.02.

    (a)  Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is
    referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the
    successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants,
    promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Borrowers, the
    Agents or the Banks that are contained in this Agreement
    shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective
    successors and assigns.  The Borrowers may not assign or
    transfer any of their respective rights or obligations
    hereunder without the prior written consent of all the Banks.

              (b)  Each Bank may assign to one or more Eligible

    and obligations under this Agreement (including a portion of
    its Commitments with respect to both Tranches and the same
    portion of the Loans of its Tranches at the time owing to it
    and the Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) except
    in the case of an assignment to a Bank or an Affiliate of a

    and not a varying, percentage of all the assigning Bank's

    less than $10,000,000 and shall be in an amount which is an
    integral multiple of $1,000,000, (iv) the parties to each
    such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Funds

    to the Agents an Administrative Questionnaire.  Upon such
    execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after
    the effective date specified in each Assignment and
    Acceptance, which effective date shall be at least five
    Business Days after the execution thereof, (x) the assignee
    thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
    provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights
    and obligations of a Bank hereunder and (y) the Bank
    thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such assignment,
    be released from its obligations under this Agreement.

              (c)  By executing and delivering an Assignment and
    Acceptance, the assigning Bank thereunder and the assignee
    thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other
    parties hereto as follows: (i) other than the representation
    and warranty that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the
    interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse
    claim, such assigning Bank makes no representation or
    warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
    statements, warranties or representations made in or in
    connection with the Agreement or the execution, legality,
    validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
    of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other
    instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such
    assigning Bank makes no representation or warranty and
    assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial
    condition of the Borrowers or the performance or observance
    by the Borrowers of any of their respective obligations under
    this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other
    instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto;
    (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of
    this Agreement, together with copies of the financial
    statements referred to in Section 3.05 and such other
    documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to
    make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
    Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
    independently and without reliance upon either Agent, such
    Bank's assignor or any other Bank and based on such documents
    and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
    continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not
    taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee
    confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee
    appoints and authorizes each Agent to take such action as
    agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this

    together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
    thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform
    in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which
    by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed
    by it as a Bank.

              (d)  The Funds Administrator shall maintain at its
    address referred to in Section 9.01 a copy of each Assignment
    and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
    recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the
    Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to,
    each Bank from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in
    the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of
    demonstrable error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative
    Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is
    recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all purposes
    of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for
    inspection by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any
    Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
    reasonable prior notice.

              (e)  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and
    Acceptance executed by an assigning Bank and an Eligible
    Assignee together with the Notes subject to such assignment,
    the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
    (b) above and, if required, the Borrowers written consent to
    such assignment, the Funds Administrator shall (subject to
    the consent of the Agents to such assignment, if required),
    if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is
    in the form of Exhibit 1.01-B hereto, (i) accept such
    Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information
    contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt
    notice thereof to the Borrowers, the Banks and the
    Administrative Agent.  Within five Business Days after
    receipt of notice, the Borrowers, at their own expense, shall
    execute and deliver to the Funds Administrator in exchange
    for the surrendered Notes a new Tranche A Note to the order
    of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the assigning
    Bank's Tranche A Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such
    Assignment and Acceptance and a new Tranche B Note to the
    order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the
    assigning Bank's Tranche B Commitment assumed by such
    Eligible Assignee pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
    and a new Tranche A Note to the order of the assigning Bank
    in an amount equal to the portion of its Tranche A Commitment
    retained by the assigning Bank hereunder and a new Tranche B
    Note to the order of the assigning Bank in an amount equal to
    the portion of its Tranche B Commitment retained by the
    assigning Bank hereunder.  Such new Notes shall be in an
    aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal
    amount of such surrendered Notes, shall be dated the
    effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall
    otherwise be in substantially the respective form of Exhibit
    2.04-A or Exhibit 2.04-B hereto, as applicable.  Cancelled
    Notes shall be returned to the Borrower that is the signatory
    thereto.

              (f)  Each Bank may without the consent of the
    Borrowers or either Agent sell participations to one or more
    banks or other entities in all or a portion of its rights and
    obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
    of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it and the Notes
    held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Bank's
    obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)
    such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other
    parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii)
    the participating banks or other entities shall be entitled
    to the cost protection provisions contained in Sections 2.11
    through 2.13 to the same extent that the Bank from which such
    participating bank or other entity acquired its participation
    would be entitled to the benefit of such cost protection
    provisions and (iv) the Borrowers, the Agents and the other
    Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
    Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations
    under this Agreement, and such Bank shall retain the sole
    right to enforce the obligations of the Borrowers relating to
    the Loans and to approve any amendment, modification or
    waiver of any provision of this Agreement (other than
    amendments, modifications or waivers with respect to any fees
    payable hereunder or the amount of principal of or the rate
    at which interest is payable on the Loans, or the dates fixed
    for payments of principal of or interest on the Loans).

              (g)  Any Bank or participant may, in connection
    with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment
    or participation pursuant to this Section 9.03, disclose to
    the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
    participant, any information relating to the Borrowers
    furnished to such Bank by or on behalf of the Borrowers;
    provided that prior to any such disclosure, each such
    assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
    shall agree (subject to customary exceptions) to preserve the
    confidentiality of any confidential information relating to
    the Borrowers received from such Bank.

              (h)  Anything in this Section 9.03 to the contrary
    notwithstanding, any Bank may at any time, without the
    consent of the Borrowers or either Agent, assign and pledge
    all or any portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to
    it to any Federal Reserve Bank (and its transferees) as
    collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board and
    any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. 
    No such assignment shall release the assigning Bank from its
    obligations hereunder.

         SECTION 9.04.  Expenses of the Banks; Indemnity.  (a)
    Tandy agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
    reasonably incurred by the Agents in connection with the
    preparation of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan
    Documents or with any amendments, modifications or waivers of
    the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions hereby
    contemplated shall be consummated) or reasonably incurred by
    either Agent or any Bank in connection with the enforcement
    or protection of their rights in connection with this
    Agreement or with the Loans made or the Notes issued
    hereunder, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of
    Andrews & Kurth, special counsel for the Agents, and, in
    connection with such enforcement or protection, the
    reasonable fees and disbursements of other counsel for any
    Bank, including allocated staff counsel costs.  Tandy agrees
    that it shall indemnify the Banks from and hold them harmless
    against any documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by
    any governmental authority by reason of the execution and
    delivery of this Agreement or any of the Notes.

              (b)  Tandy agrees to indemnify the Agents and the
    Banks and their directors, officers, employees and agents
    (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and
    to hold the Banks and such Indemnitee harmless from, any and
    all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related
    expenses, including reasonable counsel fees and expenses,
    incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
    of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the
    execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
    documents contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties
    hereto and thereto of their respective obligations hereunder
    and thereunder (including but not limited to the making of
    the Commitments of each Bank) and consummation of the
    transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) the use of
    proceeds of the Loans or (iii) any claim, litigation,
    investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
    whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided
    that such indemnity shall not, as to any Bank, apply to any
    such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
    that are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by
    final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the
    gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. 
    Tandy agrees, however, that it expressly intends to indemnify
    each Indemnitee from and hold each of them harmless against
    any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses
    arising out of the ordinary sole or contributory negligence
    of such Indemnitee, but not the gross negligence or willful
    misconduct of such Indemnitee.

              (c)  The provisions of this Section 9.04 shall
    remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
    the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the
    consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
    repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or
    unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement
    or any Note, or any investigation made by or on behalf of any
    Bank.  All amounds due under this Section 9.04 shall be
    payable on written demand therefor.

         SECTION 9.05.  Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default
    shall have occurred and be continuing, each Bank is hereby
    authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
    extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
    deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
    final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time
    owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the account of
    either Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the
    Borrowers now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and
    the Notes held by such Bank, irrespective of whether or not
    such Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement or
    such Notes and although such obligations may be unmatured. 
    Each Bank agrees promptly to notify such Borrower after any
    such setoff and application made by such Bank, but the
    failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
    such setoff and application.  The rights of each Bank under
    this Section 9.05 are in addition to other rights and
    remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Bank
    may have under applicable law.

         SECTION 9.06.  Governing Law.  This Agreement, the
    Notes, the other Loan Documents and all other documents
    executed in connection herewith, shall be deemed to be
    contracts and agreements executed by the Borrowers, the
    Agents and the Banks under the laws of the State of Texas and
    of the United States of America and for all purposes shall be
    governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance
    with, the laws of said state (without regard to principles of
    conflicts of law) and of the United States of America. 
    Without limitation of the foregoing, nothing in this
    Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents shall be
    deemed to constitute a waiver of any rights which any Bank
    may have under applicable federal legislation relating to the
    amount of interest which such Bank may contract for, take,
    receive, or charge in respect of any Loans, including any
    right to take, receive, reserve and charge interest at the
    rate allowed by the law of the state where such Bank is
    located.  The Agents, the Banks and the Borrowers further
    agree that insofar as the provisions of Article 1.04,
    Subtitle 1, Title 79, of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas,
    1925, as amended, are at any time applicable to the
    determination of the Highest Lawful Rate with respect to the
    Notes, the indicated rate ceiling computed from time to time
    pursuant to Section (a) of such Article shall apply to the
    Notes, provided, however, that to the extent permitted by
    such Article, the Funds Administrator may from time to time
    by notice from the Funds Administrator to the Borrowers
    revise the election of such interest rate ceiling as such
    ceiling affects the then current or future balances of the
    Loans outstanding hereunder and under the Notes.  The
    provisions of Chapter 15 of Subtitle 3 of the said Title 79
    do not apply to this Agreement or any Note issued hereunder.

         SECTION 9.07.  Waivers; Amendments.  (a)  No failure or
    delay of any Agent or any Bank in exercising any power or
    right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
    any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
    any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a
    right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
    thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The
    rights and remedies of the Agents and the Banks hereunder are
    cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which
    they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of
    this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents or
    consent to any departure by the Borrowers therefrom shall in
    any event be effective unless the same shall be authorized as
    provided in paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or
    consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
    for the purpose for which given.  No notice or demand on the
    Borrowers in any case shall entitle the Borrowers to any
    other or further notice or demand in similar or other
    circumstances.  Each holder of any of the Notes shall be
    bound by any amendment, modification, waiver or consent
    authorized as provided herein, whether or not such Notes
    shall have been marked to indicate such amendment,
    modification, waiver or consent.

              (b)  Except as provided in Section 2.19, neither
    this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
    amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or
    agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the
    Required Banks; provided, however, that no such agreement
    shall (i) change the principal amount of, or extend or
    advance the maturity of or any date for the payment of any
    principal of or interest on, any Loan, or waive or excuse any
    such payment or any part thereof, or change the rate of
    interest on any Loan, without the written consent of each
    Bank affected thereby, (ii) change the Commitments of any
    Bank without the written consent of such Bank, or change the
    Commitment Fees of any Bank without the written consent of
    each Bank or (iii) amend or modify the provisions of this
    Section 9.07, Sections 2.08 through 2.15, Section 2.17,
    Section 2.18, Section 9.03 or the definition of the "Required
    Banks", without the written consent of each Bank; and
    provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify,
    waive or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
    Administrative Agent hereunder without the written consent of
    the Administrative Agent; and provided, finally, that no such
    agreement shall amend, modify, waive or otherwise affect the
    rights or duties of the Funds Administrator hereunder without
    the written consent of the Funds Administrator.  Each Bank
    and each holder of any Note shall be bound by any
    modification or amendment authorized by this Section 9.07
    regardless of whether its Notes shall be marked to make
    reference thereto, and any consent by any Bank or holder of a
    Note pursuant to this Section 9.07 shall bind any Person
    subsequently acquiring a Note from it, whether or not such
    Note shall be so marked.

         SECTION 9.08.  Interest.  Anything in this Agreement or
    any Note or any other Loan Document to the contrary
    notwithstanding, no Borrower shall ever be required to pay
    unearned interest on any Note of such Borrower and shall
    never be required to pay interest on such Note at a rate in
    excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, and if the effective rate
    of interest which would otherwise be payable under this
    Agreement, such Note and the other Loan Documents would
    exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, or if the holder of such Note
    shall receive any unearned interest or shall receive monies
    that are deemed to constitute interest which would increase
    the effective rate of interest payable by such Borrower under
    this Agreement and such Note to a rate in excess of the
    Highest Lawful Rate, then (a) the amount of interest which
    would otherwise be payable by such Borrower under this
    Agreement and such Note shall be reduced to the amount
    allowed under applicable law, and (b) any unearned interest
    paid by such Borrower or any interest paid by such Borrower
    in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate shall be credited on the
    principal of such Note (or, if the principal amount of such
    Note shall have been paid in full, refunded to such
    Borrower).  It is further agreed that, without limitation of
    the foregoing, all calculations of the rate of interest
    contracted for, charged or received by any Bank under the
    Notes held by it, or under this Agreement, are made for the
    purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds the Highest
    Lawful Rate applicable to such Bank (such Highest Lawful Rate
    being such Bank's "Maximum Permissible Rate"), and shall be
    made, to the extent permitted by usury laws applicable to
    such Bank (now or hereafter enacted), by amortizing,
    prorating and spreading in equal parts during the period of
    the full stated term of the Loans evidenced by said Notes all
    interest at any time contracted for, charged or received by
    such Bank in connection therewith.  If at any time and from
    time to time (i) the amount of interest payable to any Bank
    on any date shall be computed at such Bank's Maximum
    Permissible Rate pursuant to this Section 9.08 and (ii) in
    respect of any subsequent interest computation period the
    amount of interest otherwise payable to such Bank would be
    less than the amount of interest payable to such Bank
    computed at such Bank's Maximum Permissible Rate, then the
    amount of interest payable to such Bank in respect of such
    subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be
    computed at such Bank's Maximum Permissible Rate until the
    total amount of interest payable to such Bank shall equal the
    total amount of interest which would have been payable to
    such Bank if the total amount of interest had been computed
    without giving effect to this Section 9.08.

         SECTION 9.09.  Severability.  In the event any one or
    more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in the
    Notes should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
    respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
    remaining provisions contained herein or therein shall not in
    any way be affected or impaired thereby.  The parties shall
    endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid,
    illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions,
    the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to
    that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

         SECTION 9.10.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be
    executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall
    constitute an original but all of which when taken together
    shall constitute but one contract, and shall become effective
    as provided in Section 9.11.

         SECTION 9.11.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall
    become effective on the Execution Date, and thereafter shall
    be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers,
    each Agent and each Bank and their respective successors and
    assigns, except that the Borrowers shall not have the right
    to assign their rights hereunder or any interest herein
    except as provided in Section 9.03(a).

         SECTION 9.12.  FINAL AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES.  THIS
    WRITTEN AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES
    HERETO), THE NOTES, THE OPERATING AGREEMENT, THE SUPPORT
    AGREEMENT, THE AGENT'S LETTER AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS
    CONSTITUTE A "LOAN AGREEMENT" AS DEFINED IN SECTION 26.02(a)
    OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, AND REPRESENT THE
    FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE
    CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR
    SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.  THERE ARE NO
    UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  Any previous
    agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
    matter hereof is superseded by this Agreement.  Nothing in
    this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer
    upon any party other than the parties hereto any rights,
    remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of
    this Agreement.

         SECTION 9.13 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.  (a)  TCC
    HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY TEXAS
    STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN FORT WORTH, TEXAS OVER ANY
    ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
    AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AND TCC
    IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION
    OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH TEXAS STATE
    OR FEDERAL COURT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION
    9.13 IS INTENDED TO WAIVE THE RIGHT OF EITHER AGENT OR ANY
    BANK OR TO REMOVE ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN
    ANY SUCH TEXAS STATE COURT TO AN APPROPRIATE TEXAS FEDERAL
    COURT TO THE EXTENT THE BASIS FOR SUCH REMOVAL EXISTS UNDER
    APPLICABLE LAW.  TCC HEREBY IRREVOCABLY APPOINTS HERSCHEL C. 
    WINN (THE "PROCESS AGENT"), WITH AN OFFICE ON THE DATE HEREOF
    AT 1800 ONE TANDY CENTER, FORT WORTH, TEXAS 76102, AS ITS
    AGENT TO RECEIVE ON BEHALF OF IT AND ITS PROPERTIES SERVICE
    OF COPIES OF THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT AND ANY OTHER PROCESS
    WHICH MAY BE SERVED IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.  SUCH
    SERVICE MAY BE MADE BY MAILING BY CERTIFIED MAIL A COPY OF
    SUCH PROCESS TO TCC IN CARE OF THE PROCESS AGENT AT THE
    PROCESS AGENT'S ABOVE ADDRESS, WITH A COPY TO TCC AT ITS
    ADDRESS SPECIFIED HEREIN AND TCC HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
    AUTHORIZES AND DIRECTS THE PROCESS AGENT TO ACCEPT SUCH
    SERVICE ON ITS BEHALF.  AS AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF SERVICE,
    TCC ALSO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL
    PROCESS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING BY
    CERTIFIED MAIL OF COPIES OF SUCH PROCESS TO IT AT ITS ADDRESS
    SPECIFIED HEREIN.  TCC AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY
    SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE
    ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN
    ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.

              (b)  NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 9.13 SHALL AFFECT THE
    RIGHT OF THE AGENTS OR ANY BANK TO SERVE LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY
    OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR AFFECT THE RIGHT OF EITHER
    AGENT OR ANY BANK TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST
    TCC OR ITS PROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER
    JURISDICTIONS.

         IN WITNESS HEREOF, the Borrowers, the Banks, the
    Administrative Agent and the Funds Administrator have caused
    this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective
    authorized officers as of the day and year first above
    written.

                     CONTINUING GUARANTY


         THIS CONTINUING GUARANTY (the "Guaranty") is made by
    Tandy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"),
    in favor of the Banks (as hereinafter defined), Texas
    Commerce Bank, National Association, as a Bank and as
    Administrative Agent for the other Banks and Texas Commerce
    Bank National Association, as Funds Administrator for the
    Banks.

                       PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

         WHEREAS, this Guaranty is executed and delivered
    pursuant to Section 7.01(d) of that certain Revolving Credit
    Agreement dated as of June 17, 1991 (the "Credit Agreement")
    among the Guarantor, Tandy Credit Corporation, a Delaware
    corporation ("TCC"), the Banks from time to time party
    thereto (the "Banks"), Texas Commerce Bank, National
    Association, as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative
    Agent"), and Texas Commerce Bank National Association, as
    Funds Administrator (the "Funds Administrator"); capitalized
    terms used in this Guaranty which are not defined herein
    shall have the same meanings as provided in the Credit
    Agreement; and

         WHEREAS, the Guarantor has determined that it will
    receive substantial benefit if Loans are made to TCC pursuant
    to the Credit Agreement and has agreed to execute and deliver
    this Guaranty;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the
    Guarantor agrees as follows:

         SECTION 1.  Guaranty.  The Guarantor hereby absolutely,
    unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual
    payment and performance when due, whether at stated maturity,
    by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and
    covenants of TCC now or hereafter existing under the Credit
    Agreement, the Notes and any of the other Loan Documents to
    which it is a party whether for principal, interest
    (including, without limitation, interest accruing or becoming
    owing both prior to and subsequent to the commencement of any
    proceeding against or with respect to TCC under any chapter
    of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, 11 U.S.C. 101 et seq.), fees,
    commissions, expenses (including reasonable counsel fees,
    including reasonable allocated costs of any Bank's in-house
    counsel fees, and expenses) or otherwise, and all reasonable
    costs and expenses, if any, incurred by the Administrative
    Agent, the Funds Administrator or any Bank in connection with
    enforcing any rights under this Guaranty (all such
    obligations being the "Guaranteed Obligations"), and agrees
    to pay any and all expenses incurred by each Bank, the
    Administrative Agent and the Funds Administrator in enforcing
    this Guaranty.  This Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional,
    present and continuing guaranty of payment and not of
    collectibility and is in no way conditioned upon any attempt
    to collect from TCC or any other action, occurrence or
    circumstance whatsoever.

         SECTION 2.  Continuing Guaranty.  The Guarantor
    guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid
    strictly in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty, the
    Notes and the other Loan Documents.  The Guarantor agrees
    that the Guaranteed Obligations and Loan Documents may be
    extended or renewed, and Loans repaid and reborrowed in whole
    or in part, without notice to or assent by the Guarantor, and
    that it will remain bound upon this Guaranty notwithstanding
    any extension, renewal or other alteration of any Guaranteed
    Obligations or Loan Documents, or any repayment and
    reborrowing of Loans.  The obligations of the Guarantor under
    this Guaranty shall be absolute, unconditional and
    irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
    with the terms hereof under any circumstances whatsoever,
    including:

         (a)  any extension, renewal, modification, settlement,
    compromise, waiver or release in respect of any Guaranteed
    Obligations, including any reduction or termination of all or
    a portion of the Total Commitment or any Commitment of any
    Bank;

         (b)  any extension, renewal, amendment, modification,
    rescission, waiver or release in respect of any Loan
    Documents;

         (c)  any release, exchange, substitution, non-perfection
    or invalidity of, or failure to exercise rights or remedies
    with respect to, any direct or indirect security for any
    Guaranteed Obligations, including the release of the
    Guarantor or other Person liable on any Guaranteed
    Obligations;

         (d)  any change in the corporate existence, structure or
    ownership of TCC, the Guarantor, or any insolvency,
    bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding
    affecting TCC, the Guarantor, any other guarantor or any of
    their respective assets;

         (e)  the existence of any claim, defense, set-off or
    other rights or remedies which the Guarantor at any time may
    have against TCC, or TCC or the Guarantor may have at any
    time against any Agent, any Bank, any other guarantor or any
    other Person, whether in connection with this Guaranty, the
    Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby and
    thereby or any other transaction;

         (f)  any invalidity or unenforceability for any reason
    of the Credit Agreement or other Loan Documents, or any
    provision of law purporting to prohibit the payment or
    performance by TCC, the Guarantor or any other guarantor of
    the Guaranteed Obligations or Loan Documents, or of any other
    obligations to any Agent or any Bank; or

         (g)  any other circumstances or happening whatsoever,
    whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

         SECTION 3.  Effect of Debtor Relief Laws.  If after
    receipt of any payment of, or proceeds of any security
    applied (or intended to be applied) to the payment of all or
    any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, any Agent or any Bank
    is for any reason compelled to surrender or voluntarily
    surrenders, such payment or proceeds to any Person (a)
    because such payment or application of proceeds is or may be
    avoided, invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside,
    determined to be void or voidable as a preference, fraudulent
    conveyance, fraudulent transfer, impermissible set-off or a
    diversion of trust funds, or (b) for any other reason,
    including (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or
    administrative body having jurisdiction over such Agent, any
    Bank or any of their respective properties, or (ii) any
    settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such
    Agent or any Bank with any such claimant (including TCC),
    then the Guaranteed Obligations or part thereof intended to
    be satisfied shall be reinstated and continue, and this
    Guaranty shall continue in full force as if such payment or
    proceeds have not been received, notwithstanding any
    revocation thereof or the cancellation of any Note or any
    other instrument evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations or
    otherwise; and the Guarantor shall be liable to pay such
    Agent and the Banks, and hereby does indemnify the Agents and
    the Banks and holds them harmless for the amount of such
    payment or proceeds so surrendered and all expenses
    (including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and
    expenses attributable thereto) incurred by any Agent or any
    Bank in the defense of any claim made against it that any
    payment or proceeds received by such Agent or any Bank in
    respect of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations must be
    surrendered.  The provisions of this paragraph shall survive
    the termination of this Guaranty, and any satisfaction and
    discharge of TCC by virtue of any payment, court order or any
    federal or state law.

         SECTION 4.  Waiver of Subrogation.  Notwithstanding any
    payment or payments made by the Guarantor hereunder, or any
    set-off or application by the Agents or any Bank of any
    security or of any credits or claims, the Guarantor will not
    assert or exercise any rights of any Agent or any Bank or of
    the Guarantor against TCC to recover the amount of any
    payment made by the Guarantor to such Agent or any Bank
    hereunder by way of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution,
    indemnity, or otherwise arising by contract or operation of
    law, and the Guarantor shall not have any right of recourse
    to or any claim against assets or property of TCC, whether or
    not the obligations of TCC have been satisfied, all of such
    rights being herein expressly waived by the Guarantor.  The
    Guarantor agrees not to seek contribution from any other
    Person until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have
    been paid in full and the Total Commitment is terminated.  If
    any amount shall nevertheless by paid to the Guarantor by TCC
    prior to payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, such
    amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Agents
    and the Banks and shall forthwith be paid to the Funds
    Administrator to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed
    Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.  The provisions of
     this paragraph shall survive the termination of this
    Guaranty, and any satisfaction and discharge of TCC by virtue
    of any payment, court order or any law.

         SECTION 5.  Subordination.  The Guarantor hereby
    subordinates all indebtedness owing to it from TCC to all
    indebtedness of TCC to the Agents and the Banks, and agrees
    that upon the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an
    Event of Default, it shall not accept any payment on the same
    until payment in full of the obligations of TCC under the
    Credit Agreement, the Notes and all other Loan Documents, and
    shall in no circumstance whatsoever attempt to set-off or
    reduce any obligations hereunder because of such
    indebtedness.  If any amount shall nevertheless be paid to
    the Guarantor by TCC prior to payment in full of the
    Guaranteed Obligations, such amount shall be held in trust
    for the benefit of the Agents and the Banks and shall
    forthwith be paid to the Funds Administrator to be credited
    and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or
    unmatured.

         SECTION 6.  Waiver.  The Guarantor hereby waives
    promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other
    notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and
    this Guaranty and waives presentment, protest, demand of
    payment, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of
    acceleration, notice of dishonor or nonpayment and any
    requirement that the Agents or any Bank institute suit,
    collection proceedings or take any other action to collect
    the Guaranteed Obligations, including any requirement that
    the Agents or any Bank protect, secure, perfect or insure any
    Lien against any property subject thereto or exhaust any
    right or take any action against TCC or any other Person or
    any collateral (it being the intention of the Agents, the
    Banks and the Guarantor that this Guaranty is to be a
    guaranty of payment and not of collection).  It shall not be
    necessary for the Agents or any Banks, in order to enforce
    any payment by the Guarantor hereunder, to institute suit or
    exhaust its rights and remedies against TCC or any other
    Person, including others liable to pay any Guaranteed
    Obligations, or to enforce its rights against any security
    ever given to secure payment thereof.  The Guarantor hereby
    expressly waives each and every right to which it may be
    entitled by virtue of the suretyship laws of the State of
    Texas, including, without limitation, any and all rights it
    may have pursuant to Rule 31, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure,
    Section 17.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code
    and Chapter 34 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code.  The
    Guarantor hereby waives marshaling of assets and liabilities,
    notice by any Agent or any Bank or any indebtedness or
    liability to which such Bank applies or may apply any amounts
    received by such Bank and of the creation, advancement,
    increase, existence, extension, renewal, rearrangement and/or
    modification of the Guaranteed Obligations.  The Guaranty
    expressly waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
    the benefit of any and all laws providing for exemption of
    property from execution or for valuation and appraisal upon
    foreclosure.

         SECTION 7.  Full force and Effect.  This Guaranty is a
    continuing guaranty and shall remain in full force and effect
    until payment in full of the obligations of TCC under the
    Credit Agreement, the Notes and all other Loan Documents and
    all other amounts payable under this Guaranty and until the
    termination of the Total Commitment.

         SECTION 8.  Independent Obligations.  The obligations
    hereunder are independent of the obligations of TCC, and a
    separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted
    against the Guarantor whether action is brought against TCC
    or whether TCC is joined in any such action or actions.

         SECTION 9.  Renewals, Security, Etc.  The Guarantor
    authorizes the Banks or any of them, without notice or demand
    and without affecting the Guarantor's liability hereunder,
    from time to time, either before or after revocation hereof,
    to (a) renew, compromise, extend, accelerate or otherwise
    change the time for payment of, or otherwise change the terms
    of the indebtedness or any part thereof, including increase
    or decrease of the rate of interest thereon as provided in
    the Credit Agreement; (b) take and hold security for the
    payment of this Guaranty or the indebtedness guaranteed, and
    exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or
    otherwise dispose of any such security; (c) apply such
    security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as
    each Bank in its discretion may determine; and (d) release or
    substitute any one or more of the endorsers or guarantors.

         SECTION 10.  Information.  The Guarantor acknowledges
    and agrees that it shall have the sole responsibility for
    obtaining from TCC such information concerning TCC's
    financial condition or business operations as the Guarantor
    may require, and that the Banks have no duty at any time to
    disclose to the Guarantor any information relating to the
    business operations or financial condition of TCC.

         SECTION 11.  Set-Off.  If an Event of Default shall have
    occurred and be continuing, each Bank is hereby authorized at
    any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
    permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
    (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
    any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by
    such Bank to or for the credit or the account of the
    Guarantor against any of and all the obligations of the
    Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty held
    by such Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Bank shall
    have made any demand under this Guaranty and although such
    obligations may be unmatured.  Each Bank agrees promptly to
    notify the Guarantor after any such set-off and application
    made by such Bank, but the failure to give such notice shall
    not affect the validity of such set-off and application.  The
    rights of each Bank under this Section 11 are in addition to
    other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off)
    which such Bank may have under applicable law.

         SECTION 12.  Powers.  It is not necessary for the Banks
    or any of them to inquire into the powers of TCC or of the

    upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be
    guaranteed hereunder.

         SECTION 13.  Authority; Binding Obligation.  The
    Guarantor has all requisite power and authority to deliver

         SECTION 16.  Waivers; Amendments.  (a)  No failure or
    delay of any Agent or any Bank in exercising any power or
    right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
    any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or

    they would otherwise have.  No waive of any provision of this
    Guaranty or consent to any departure by the Guarantor

    applicable law nor prevent the Guarantor from successfully
    asserting the claim or defense of usury.

         SECTION 18.  Severability.  In the event any one or more
    of the provisions contained in this Guaranty should be held
    invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the

    provisions contained herein or therein shall not in any way
    be affected or impaired thereby.  The parties shall endeavor
    in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
    unenforceable provisions with valid provisions, the economic
    effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the
    invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

    any Bank may assign or otherwise transfer a portion of its

                                                       EXHIBIT 4e
                       CONTINUING GUARANTY


         THIS CONTINUING GUARANTY (the "Guaranty") is made by
    Tandy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"),
    in favor of the holders from time to time of commercial
    paper, medium term notes and other indebtedness issued by
    Tandy Credit Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("TCC"),
    that (a) is or may be publicly traded and (b) is rated by at
    least one nationally recognized rating agency (all such
    commercial paper, notes and other indebtedness of TCC meeting
    both such criteria being collectively, the "Public Rated
    Debt").

         WHEREAS, the Guarantor is the owner and the holder of
    all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of TCC; and

         WHEREAS, the Guarantor has determined that it will
    receive substantial benefit if the publicly traded debt of
    TCC is Publicly Rated Debt;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the
    Guarantor agrees as follows:

         SECTION 1.  Guaranty.  The Guarantor hereby absolutely,
    unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual
    payment and performance when due, whether at stated maturity,
    by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and
    covenants of TCC now or hereafter existing under any Publicly
    Rated Debt issued by TCC for principal, interest (including,
    without limitation, interest accruing or becoming owing both
    prior to and subsequent to the commencement of any proceeding
    against or with respect to TCC under any chapter of the
    Bankruptcy Code of 1978, 11 U.S.C. 101 et seq.), or
    otherwise, and all reasonable costs and expenses, if any,
    incurred by the holders of Publicly Rated Debt (the
    "Debtholders") in connection with enforcing any rights under
    this Guaranty (all such obligations being the "Guaranteed
    Obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses
    incurred by each Debtholder in enforcing this Guaranty.  This
    Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional, present and
    continuing guaranty of payment and not of collectibility and
    is in no way conditioned upon any attempt to collect from TCC
    or any other action, occurrence or circumstance whatsoever.

         SECTION 2.  Continuing Guaranty.  The Guarantor
    guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid
    strictly in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty, and
    any note or other instrument or document ("Debt Documents")
    evidencing any Publicly Rated Debt.  The Guarantor agrees
    that the Guaranteed Obligations and Debt Documents may be
    extended or renewed, and Publicly Rated Debt repaid and
    reborrowed in whole or in part, without notice to or assent
    by the Guarantor, and that it will remain bound upon this
    Guaranty notwithstanding any extension, renewal or other
    alteration of any Guaranteed Obligations or Debt Documents,
    or any repayment and reborrowing of Publicly Rated Debt.  The
    obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be
    absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be
    performed strictly in accordance with the terms hereof under
    any circumstances whatsoever, including:

         (a)  any extension, renewal, modification, settlement,
    compromise, waiver or release in respect of any Guaranteed
    Obligations;

         (b)  any extension, renewal, amendment, modification,
    rescissions, waiver or release in respect of any Debt
    Documents;

         (c)  any release, exchange, substitution, non-perfection
    or invalidity of, or failure to exercise rights or remedies
    with respect to, any direct or indirect security for any
    Guaranteed Obligations, including the release of the
    Guarantor or other person liable on any Guaranteed
    Obligations;

         (d)  any change in the corporate existence, structure or
    ownership of TCC, the Guarantor, or any insolvency,
    bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding
    affecting TCC, the Guarantor, any other guarantor or any of
    their respective assets;

         (e)  the existence of any claim, defense, set-off or
    other rights or remedies which the Guarantor at any time may
    have against TCC, or TCC or the Guarantor may have at any
    time against any Debtholder, any other guarantor or any other
    person, whether in connection with this Guaranty, the Debt
    Documents or any other transaction;

         (f)  any invalidity or unenforceability for any reason
    of the Debt Documents, or any provision of law purporting to
    prohibit the payment or performance by TCC, the Guarantor or
    any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or Debt
    Documents, or of any other obligations to any Debtholder,; or

         (g)  any other circumstances or happening whatsoever,
    whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

         SECTION 3.  Effect of Debtor Relief Laws.  If after
    receipt of any payment of, or proceeds of any security
    applied (or intended to be applied) to the payment of all or
    any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, any Debtholder is for
    any reason compelled to surrender or voluntarily surrenders,
    such payment or proceeds to any person (a) because such
    payment or application of proceeds is or may be avoided,
    invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be
    void or voidable as a preference, fraudulent conveyance,
    fraudulent transfer, impermissible set-off or a diversion of
    trust funds, or (b) for any other reason, including (i) any
    judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body
    having jurisdiction over such Debtholder or any of their
    respective properties, or (ii) any settlement or compromise
    of any such claim effected by such Debtholder with any such
    claimant (including TCC), then the Guaranteed Obligations or
    part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be reinstated and
    continue, and this Guaranty shall continue in full force as
    if such payment or proceeds have not been received,
    notwithstanding any revocation thereof or the cancellation of
    any Debt Document evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations or
    otherwise; and the Guarantor shall be liable to pay such
    Debtholder, and hereby does indemnify the Debtholders and
    holds them harmless for the amount of such payment or
    proceeds so surrendered and all expenses (including
    reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and expenses
    attributable thereto) incurred by any Debtholder in the
    defense of any claim made against it that any payment or
    proceeds received by such Debtholder in respect of all or
    part of the Guaranteed Obligations must be surrendered.  The
    provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of
    this Guaranty, and any satisfaction and discharge of TCC by
    virtue of any payment, court order or any federal or state
    law.

         SECTION 4.  Waiver of Subrogation.  Notwithstanding any
    payment or payments made by the Guarantor hereunder, or any
    set-off or application by the Debtholders of any security or
    of any credits or claims, the Guarantor will not assert or
    exercise any rights of any Debtholder or of the Guarantor
    against TCC to recover the amount of any payment made by the
    Guarantor to such Debtholder by way of subrogation,
    reimbursement, contribution, indemnity, or otherwise arising
    by contract or operation of law, and the Guarantor shall not
    have any right of recourse to or any claim against assets or
    property of TCC, whether or not the obligations of TCC have
    been satisfied, all of such rights being herein expressly
    waived by the Guarantor.  The Guarantor agrees not to seek
    contribution from any other person until all of the
    Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid in full.  If any
    amount shall nevertheless by paid to the Guarantor by TCC
    prior to payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, such
    amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the
    Debtholders and shall forthwith be paid to the Debtholder or
    its representative to be credited and applied to the
    Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.  The
    provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of
    this Guaranty, and any satisfaction and discharge of TCC by
    virtue of any payment, court order or any law.

         SECTION 5.  Subordination.  The Guarantor hereby
    subordinates all indebtedness owing to it from TCC to all
    indebtedness of TCC to the Debtholders, and agrees that upon
    the occurrence and continuance of a default or an event of
    default under any Debt Document, it shall not accept any
    payment on the same until payment in full of the Guaranteed
    Obligations of TCC under any Debt Documents, and shall in no
    circumstance whatsoever attempt to set-off or reduce any
    obligations hereunder because of such indebtedness.  If any
    amount shall nevertheless be paid to the Guarantor by TCC
    prior to payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, such
    amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the
    Debtholders and shall forthwith be paid to the Debtholders or
    their representatives to be credited and applied to the
    Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.

         SECTION 6.  Waiver.  The Guarantor hereby waives
    promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other
    notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and
    this Guaranty and waives presentment, protest, demand of
    payment, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of
    acceleration, notice of dishonor or nonpayment and any
    requirement that the Debtholders institute suit, collection
    proceedings or take any other action to collect the
    Guaranteed Obligations, including any requirement that the
    Debtholders protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien
    against any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or
    take any action against TCC or any other person or any
    collateral (it being the intention of the Guarantor that this
    Guaranty is to be a guaranty of payment and not of
    collection).  It shall not be necessary for the Debtholders,
    in order to enforce any payment by the Guarantor hereunder,
    to institute suit or exhaust it rights and remedies against
    TCC or any other person, including others liable to pay any
    Guaranteed Obligations, or to enforce its rights against any
    security ever given to secure payment thereof.  The Guarantor
    hereby expressly waives each and every right to which it may
    be entitled by virtue of the suretyship laws of any state.
    The Guarantor hereby waived marshaling of assets and
    liabilities, notice by any Debtholder or any indebtedness or
    liability to which such Debtholder applies or may apply any
    amounts received by such Debtholder, and of the creation,
    advancement, increase, existence, extension, renewal,
    rearrangement and/or modification of the Guaranteed
    Obligations.  The Guaranty expressly waives, to the extent
    permitted by applicable law, the benefit of any and all laws
    providing for exemption of property from execution or for
    valuation and appraisal upon foreclosure.

         SECTION 7.  Full Force and Effect.  This Guaranty is a
    continuing guaranty and shall remain in full force and effect
    until payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations of TCC
    and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty.

         SECTION 8.  Independent Obligations.  The obligations
    hereunder are independent of the obligations of TCC, and a
    separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted
    against the Guarantor whether action is brought against TCC
    or whether TCC is joined in any such action or actions.

         SECTION 9.  Renewals, Security, Etc.  The Guarantor
    authorized the Debtholders or any of them, without notice or
    demand and without affecting the Guarantor's liability
    hereunder, from time to time, either before or after
    revocation hereof, to (a) renew, compromise, extend,
    accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or
    otherwise change the terms of the Publicly Rated Debt or any
    part thereof, including increase or decrease of the rate of
    interest thereon; (b) take and hold security for the payment
    of this Guaranty or the Publicly Rated Debt guaranteed, and
    exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or
    otherwise dispose of any such security; (c) apply such
    security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as
    each Debtholders in its discretion may determine; and (d)
    release or substitute any one or more of the endorsers or
    guarantors.

         SECTION 10.  Information.  The Guarantor acknowledges
    and agrees that it shall have the sole responsibility for
    obtaining from TCC such information concerning TCC's
    financial condition or business operations as the Guarantor
    may require, and that the Debtholders have no duty at any
    time to disclose to the Guarantor any information relating to
    the business operations or financial condition of TCC.

         SECTION 11.  Powers.  It is not necessary for the
    Debtholders or any of them to inquire into the powers of TCC
    or of the officers, directors, or agents acting or purporting
    to act on its behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in
    reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be
    guaranteed hereunder.

         SECTION 12.  Authority; Binding Obligation.  The
    Guarantor has all requisite power and authority to deliver
    and perform its obligations under this Guaranty and all
    corporate action on the Guarantor's part requisite for the
    due execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty has
    been duly and effectively taken.  This Guaranty constitutes
    the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor
    enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its
    terms.

         SECTION 13.  Notices.  All notices, consents, requests,
    approvals, demands and other communications (collectively,
    "Communications") provided for herein shall be in writing
    (including telecopy or telegraphic Communications) and shall
    be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed or
    sent by telex, graphic scanning or other telegraphic
    communications equipment addressed as provided in any Debt
    Document.

    All communications given to any party hereto in accordance
    with the provisions of this Guaranty shall be deemed to have
    been given on the date of receipt if delivered by hand or
    overnight courier service or sent by telex, telecopy or other
    telegraphic communications equipment of the sender, or on the
    date five Business Days after dispatch or certified or
    registered mail if mailed, in each case delivered, sent or
    mailed (property addressed) to such party as provided in the
    Section 13 or in accordance with the latest unrevoked
    direction from such party given in accordance with this
    Section 13.

         SECTION 14.  Governing Law.  This Guaranty shall be
    deemed to be executed by the Guarantor under the laws of the
    State of Texas and of the United States of America and for
    all purposes shall be governed by, and construed and
    interpreted in accordance with, the laws of said state
    (without regard to principles of conflicts of law) and of the
    United States of America.

         SECTION 15.  Waivers; Revocability.  (a)  No failure or
    delay of any Debtholder in exercising any power or right
    hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
    single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
    abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a
    right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
    thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The
    rights and remedies of the Debtholders hereunder are
    cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which
    they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of
    this Guaranty or consent to any departure by the Guarantor
    therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same
    shall be authorized as provided in paragraph (b) below, and
    then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
    specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  No
    notice or demand on the Guarantor in any case shall entitle
    the Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in
    similar or other circumstances.

         (b)  So long as TCC has no Publicly Rated Debt
    outstanding, this Guaranty may be terminated by the
    Guarantor, and/or TCC may be dissolved or merged into the
    Guarantor, upon thirty (30) day written notice to the
    nationally recognized rating agencies which at such time have
    a current rating for such Publicly Rated Debt.

         SECTION 16.  Usury.  Notwithstanding any other
    provisions herein contained, no provision of this Guaranty
    shall require or permit the collection from the Guarantor of
    interest in excess of the maximum rate or amount that the
    Guarantor may be required or permitted to pay pursuant to any
    applicable law nor prevent the Guarantor from successfully
    asserting the claim or defense of usury.

         SECTION 17.  Severability.  In the event any one or more
    of the provisions contained in this Guaranty should be held
    invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the
    validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
    provisions contained herein or therein shall not in any way
    be affected or impaired thereby.  The parties shall endeavor
    in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
    unenforceable provisions with valid provisions, the economic
    effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the
    invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

         SECTION 18.  Binding Effect.  This Guaranty shall become
    effective on the date it is executed by the Guarantor, and

    Section 4.1  Employer may obtain permanent life insurance
    insuring the life of any Participant as a means of funding
    Employer's obligations to his Beneficiary in whole or part.
    Employer shall be the sole owner and beneficiary of all such

    ownership therein, including without limitation, the rights
    to all cash and loan values, dividends (if any), death
    benefits and the right to terminate.  No Beneficiary or
    Participant shall be entitled to any rights, interests or

    Participant's death results from suicide within two years of

    company to obtain such insurance coverage.  If a Participant
    refuses to cooperate in the securing of life insurance, or if
    Employer is unable to secure life insurance at standard rates
    on a Participant, then, the Plan Agreement shall be of no
    force and effect as to a Participant unless Employer waives
    such requirement in writing.

    hereunder, all from its general assets, an amount equal to
    five hundred percent of Plan Compensation, reduced by five
    percent per year for each year that Early Retirement precedes
    the date of Normal Retirement.  Such year shall be a fiscal
    year beginning on the date a Participant attains age
    fifty-five (55).  Any reduction for a part of a year shall be
    prorated on a daily basis assuming a 365 day year.  Such
    amount shall be paid as set forth in Section 5.3 hereof.

         (c) Late Retirement.  If a Participant retires at a date
    that constitutes Late Retirement, then, Employer agrees to

    Compensation shall be measured on a fiscal year beginning on
    the date of a Participant's date of birth and shall commence
    on the day after the date a Participant attains age 70, and
    any reduction for a part of a year shall be prorated on a
    daily basis at the applicable percentage assuming a 365 day
    year.  Such amount shall be paid as set forth in Section 5.3
    hereof.

    Section 5.2  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
    upon the death of a Participant, but only if the Participant
    is an Employee of Employer at his death and is not entitled
    to Retirement benefits pursuant to a Plan Agreement at such
    time, Employer agrees to pay to his Beneficiary from its
    general assets an amount equal to five hundred percent of
    Plan Compensation as reflected in Employee's Plan Agreement
    or, as the case may be, in the last amendment to his Plan
    Agreement.  With respect to such benefits, however, it is
    further provided that:

         (a) No benefits shall be payable to the Beneficiary of a
    Participant in those instances covered by Section 4.2;

         (b) If a Participant dies while an Employee of Employer
    after the date of his Normal Retirement, then the amount
    payable to his Beneficiary upon a Participant's death shall
    be reduced as set forth in Section 5.1(c) hereof.

    Section 5.3  The aggregate amount payable upon the Normal
    Retirement, Early Retirement, Late Retirement or death of a
    Participant to a Participant or his Beneficiary shall be paid
    in 120 equal monthly installment payments commencing on the
    first day of the month next following thirty (30) days after
    Retirement or after the Committee's receipt of a certified
    death or proof of death certificate verifying the
    Participant's death.  A Participant shall notify Employer of
    Retirement by hand delivery or by certified or registered
    mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, of a written
    notice of Retirement specifying the effective date of
    Retirement, such written notice to be addressed to: Insurance
    Committee of the Board of Directors, Tandy Corporation, 1800
    One Tandy Center, Fort Worth, Texas 76102.  Such notice shall
    be deemed to be received when actually received by said
    Insurance Committee at said address as may be changed from
    time to time in the Plan Agreements, as amended.

    Section 5.4  Until actually paid and delivered to the
    Participant or to the Beneficiary entitled to same, none of
    the benefits payable by Employer under any Plan Agreement
    shall be liable for the debts or liabilities of either the
    Participant or his Beneficiary, nor shall the same be subject
    to seizure by any creditor of the Participant or his
    Beneficiary under any writ or proceeding at law, in equity or
    in bankruptcy.  Further, no Participant or Beneficiary shall
    have power to sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or in any
    manner anticipate or dispose of the benefits to which he is
    entitled or may become entitled under a Plan Agreement.

    Section 5.5  After Participant has attained the age of
    fifty-five (55) and is an Employee of Employer, or during the
    period that Participant is receiving Retirement benefits
    under a Plan Agreement, and for one year after cessation of

    as a shareholder owning less than five percent (5%) of the
    shares of a corporation whose shares are traded on a stock
    exchange or in the over-the-counter market by a member of the
    National Association of Securities Dealers.  In the event
    that a Participant takes Retirement and engages in any of the
    activities described in the immediately preceding sentence,
    or engaged in any of such activities prior to Retirement,
    then, without any further notification, and upon
    determination by the Committee that such a Participant is
    engaged or has engaged in such activities, such Committee's
    decision to be conclusive and binding upon all concerned, and
    notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or of the
    Plan Agreement with such Participant, Employer's obligation
    to a Participant to pay any Retirement or Death benefits
    hereunder shall automatically cease and terminate, and
    Employer shall have no further obligation to such Participant
    or Beneficiary pursuant to the Plan or the Plan Agreement.
    Employer may enforce this provision by suit for damages which
    shall include but not be limited to all sums paid to
    Participant hereunder, or for injunction, or both.

    Section 5.6  Employer may liquidate out of the interest of a
    Participant hereunder, but only as Retirement or death
    benefits become due and payable hereunder, any outstanding
    loan or loans or other indebtedness of a Participant.
    Employer may elect not to distribute Retirement or death
    benefits to any Participant or to a Beneficiary unless and
    until all unpaid loans or other indebtedness due to Employer
    from such Participant, together with interest, have been paid
    in full.

    Section 5.7  Subject to termination or amendment of the Plan,
    Plan Agreement, or both, a Participant's participation in the
    Plan shall continue during his Disability or his taking a
    Leave of Absence.  A Participant who is Disabled or on Leave
    of Absence shall notify Employer of his date of Retirement as
    provided in Section 5.3 hereof.

    Section 6.1  The Committee may enter into amendments to the
    Plan Agreement with any Participant for the purpose of
    increasing the benefits payable to the Participant or his
    Beneficiary in view of increases in his compensation
    following the execution of such Plan Agreement or the last
    amendment thereto and for the purpose of amending any
    provision of this Plan as it might apply to a Participant. 
    In such cases, the acceptance of an amendment by a
    Participant is voluntary and until the amended Plan Agreement
    has been submitted to and accepted by him, it shall not be
    effective.

                               ARTICLE SEVEN

                      BENEFICIARIES OF PARTICIPANTS

    Section 7.1  At the time of his acceptance of a Plan
    Agreement, a Participant shall be required to designate the
    Beneficiary to whom benefits under the Plan and his Plan
    Agreement will be payable upon his death.  A Beneficiary may
    be one or more persons or entities, such as dependents,
    persons who are natural objects of the Participant's bounty,
    an inter vivos or testamentary trust, or his estate.  Such
    Beneficiaries may be designated contingently or successively
    as the Participant may direct.  The designation of his
    Beneficiary shall be made by the Participant on a Beneficiary
    Designation Form to be furnished by the Committee and filed
    with it.

    Section 7.2  A Participant may change his Beneficiary, as he
    may desire, by filing new and amendatory Beneficiary
    Designation Forms with the Committee.

    Section 7.3  In the event a Participant designates more than
    one Beneficiary to receive benefit payments simultaneously,
    each such Beneficiary shall be paid such proportion of such
    benefits as the Participant shall have designated.  If no
    such percentage designation has been made, the Committee
    shall hold all benefit payments until the Beneficiaries agree
    as to the distribution of the funds or a judicial
    determination has been made.

    Section 7.4  If the designated Beneficiary dies before the
    Participant in question and no Beneficiary was successively
    named, or if the designated Beneficiary dies before complete
    payment of the deceased Participant's benefits have been made
    and no Beneficiary was successively named, the Committee
    shall direct that such benefits (or the balance thereof) be
    paid to those persons who are the deceased Participant's
    heirs-at-law determined in accordance with the laws of
    descent and distribution in force at the date hereof in the
    State of Texas for separate personal property, such
    determination to be made as though the Participant had died
    intestate and domiciled in Texas.

    Section 7.5  Whenever any person entitled to payments under
    this Plan shall be a minor or under other legal disability or
    in the sole judgment of the Committee shall otherwise be
    unable to apply such payments to his own best interest and
    advantage (as in the case of illness, whether mental or
    physical, or where the person not under legal disability is
    unable to preserve his estate for his own best interest), the
    Committee may in the exercise of its discretion direct all or
    any portion of such payments to be made in any one or more of
    the following ways unless claims shall have been made
    therefor by an existing and duly appointed guardian,
    conservator, committee or other duly appointed legal
    representative, in which event payment shall be made to such
    representative:

         (1) directly to such person unless such person shall be
    an infant or shall have been legally adjudicated incompetent
    at the time of the payment;

         (2) to the spouse, child, parent or other blood relative
    to be expended on behalf of the person entitled or on behalf
    of those dependents as to whom the person entitled has the
    duty of support;

         (3) to a recognized charity or governmental institution
    to be expended for the benefit of the person entitled or for
    the benefit of those dependents as to whom the person
    entitled has the duty of support; or

         (4) to any other institution, approved by the Committee,
    to be expended for the benefit of the person entitled or for
    the benefit of those dependents as to whom the person
    entitled has the duty of support.

    The decision of the Committee will, in each case, be final
    and binding upon all persons and the Committee shall not be
    obliged to see to the proper application or expenditure of
    any payments so made.  Any payment made pursuant to the power
    herein conferred upon the Committee shall operate as a
    complete discharge of the obligations of Employer and of the
    Committee.

    Section 7.6  If the Committee has any doubt as to the proper
    Beneficiary to receive payments hereunder, the Committee
    shall have the right to withhold such payments until the
    matter is finally adjudicated or, the Committee may direct
    Employer to bring a suit for interpleader in any appropriate
    court, pay any amounts due into the court, and Employer
    and/or Committee shall have the right to recover its
    reasonable attorney's fees from such proceeds so paid or to
    be paid.  Any payment made by the Committee, in good faith
    and in accordance with this Plan, shall fully discharge the
    Committee and Employer from all further obligations with
    respect to such payments.

                  crime involving moral turpitude, in which event
                  no vesting under this Section 8.4 shall occur,

    II.   Your bonus for FY94 shall be determined by multiplying

          set forth in Paragraph III and IV.

          Each percentage point of positive change that the Tandy

          3.    STOCK PRICE

          and December 1994.

          b.    If the stock performance exceeds the "Peer Group"
          average and the 5% minimum increase, a bonus will be
          paid equal to the stock price increase amount.  In
          addition, if Tandy's stock percent increase is in or
          above the 75th percentile of the "Peer Group", an
          additional bonus will be paid equal to the stock price
          increase amount.

          has given its consent to your early retirement, or die
          before the end of the then current fiscal year, your
          bonus for the current year-to-date will be calculated
          to the nearest end of the month preceding or succeeding
          such event, using the formula above and adjusting for
          the partial year.  The amount will be paid to you or to
          the legal representative of your estate.

    VI.   If at any time during your continued employment, your
          responsibility, duties or title changes, this plan is
          subject to revision or termination by the Company at
          the time of the foregoing change.

                            ARTICLE FOUR

                           LIFE INSURANCE

    Section 4.1 Employer may obtain permanent life insurance
    insuring the life of any Participant as a means of funding
    Employer's obligations to his Beneficiary in whole or part. 
    Employer shall be the sole owner and beneficiary of all such
    policies of insurance so obtained and of all incidents of
    ownership therein, including without limitation, the rights
    to all cash and loan values, dividends (if any), death
    benefits and the right to terminate.  No Beneficiary or
    Participant shall be entitled to any rights, interests or
    equities in such policies or to any specific asset of
    Employer of any type, and on the contrary, their rights
    against Employer under the Plan shall be solely as general
    creditors.

    Section 4.2 If as a result of misrepresentations made by a
    Participant in any application for life insurance upon his
    life obtained by Employer hereunder, the insurance carrier or
    carriers or any reinsurance thereof successfully avoid(s)
    payment to Employer of the proceeds of its or their policy or
    policies, or such proceeds are not payable because the
    Participant's death results from suicide within two years of
    the issuance to Employer of additional policies obtained by
    Employer hereunder, then, in any of said events, and
    notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or of the
    Plan Agreement with such Participant, Employer shall have no
    obligation to his Beneficiary to provide any of the death
    benefits otherwise payable under the terms thereof.

    Section 4.3 Each Participant shall cooperate in the securing
    of life insurance on his life by furnishing such information
    as the insurance company may require, taking such physical
    examinations as may be necessary, and taking any other action
    which may be requested by the Employer or the insurance
    company to obtain such insurance coverage.  If a Participant
    refuses to cooperate in all the securing of life insurance,
    or if Employer is unable to secure life insurance at standard
    rates on a Participant, then, the Plan Agreement shall be of
    no force and effect as to a Participant unless the Employer
    waives such requirement in writing.

    Section 4.4 All benefits under the Plan or Plan Agreement
    represent an unsecured promise to pay by Tandy.  The Plan
    shall be unfunded and the benefits hereunder shall be paid
    only from the general assets of Tandy resulting in the
    Participants and Beneficiaries having no greater rights than
    Tandy's general creditors; provided, however, nothing herein
    shall prevent or prohibit Tandy from establishing a trust or
    other arrangement for the purpose of providing for the
    payment of the benefits payable under the Plan or Plan
    Agreement.

                            ARTICLE FIVE

                BENEFITS PAYABLE TO BENEFICIARIES

    upon the death of a Participant in Retirement, Employer
    agrees to pay to Beneficiary a retirement benefit as follows:

         (a)  Normal Retirement.  If a Participant retires at a
         time that constitutes Normal Retirement, then, upon the
         death of such retired Participant, Employer agrees to
         pay to the designated Beneficiary of such deceased
         Participant, all from its general assets, a total amount
         equal to the amount set forth in the Plan Agreement,
         such amount to be paid as set forth in Section 5.3
         hereof.

         (b)  Early Retirement.  If a Participant retires at a
         time that constitutes an Early Retirement, then, upon
         the death of such retired Participant, Employer agrees
         to pay to the designated Beneficiary of such deceased
         Participant a total amount equal to the amount set forth
         in the Plan Agreement, reduced by five percent per year
         for each year that Early Retirement precedes the date of
         Normal Retirement.  Such year shall be a fiscal year
         beginning on the date a Participant attains age
         fifty-five (55).  Any reduction for a part of a year
         shall be prorated on a daily basis assuming a 365 day
         year.  Such amount shall be paid as set forth in Section
         5.3 hereof.
     
         (c)  Late Retirement.  If a Participant retires at a
         time that constitutes Late Retirement, then, upon the
         death of such retired Participant, Employer agrees to
         pay to the designated Beneficiary of such deceased
         Participant, all from its general assets, a total amount
         equal to the amount set forth on the Plan Agreement,
         reduced by a percentage determined as follows:

          At Date of Late Retirement
              Attainment of Age            Percent of Reduction

                     66                              0%
                     67                              0%
                     68                              0%
                     69                              0%
                     70                              0%
                     71                             20%
                     72                             40%

                     74                             80%
                     75                            100%

    The percent of reduction shall be measured on a fiscal year
    beginning on the date of a Participant's date of birth and
    shall commence on the day after the date a Participant
    attains age 70, and any reduction for a part of a year shall
    be prorated on a daily basis at the applicable percentage
    assuming a 365 day year.  Such amount shall be paid as set
    forth in Section 5.3 hereof.

    Section 5.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
    upon the death of a Participant in Retirement, Employer
    agrees to pay to his Beneficiary from its general assets an
    amount equal to the amount set forth in the Plan Agreement
    reduced as provided in Section 5.1 or, as the case may be, in
    the last amendment to his Plan Agreement.  With respect to
    such benefits, however, it is further provided that: No
    benefits shall be payable to the Beneficiary of a Participant
    in those instances covered by Section 4.2.

    Section 5.3 Except as provided in Section 8.5, the aggregate
    amount payable upon the death of a Participant in Retirement
    to his Beneficiary shall be paid in 120 equal monthly
    installment payments commencing on the first day of the month
    next following thirty (30) days after the Committee's receipt
    of a certified death or proof of death certificate verifying
    the retired Participant's death.  A Beneficiary shall notify
    Employer of death by hand delivery or by certified or
    registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
    of a written notice of death specifying the date of death,
    such written notice to be addressed to: Organization and
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, Tandy
    Corporation, 1800 One Tandy Center, Fort Worth, Texas 76102.
    Such notice shall be deemed to be received when actually
    received by said Committee at said address as may be changed
    from time to time in the Plan Agreements, as amended.

    Section 5.4 Until actually paid and delivered to the
    Beneficiary entitled to same, none of the benefits payable by
    Employer under any Plan Agreement shall be liable for the
    debts or liabilities of either the Participant or his
    Beneficiary, nor shall the same be subject to seizure by any
    creditor of the Participant or his Beneficiary under any writ
    or proceeding at law, in equity or in bankruptcy.  Further,
    no Participant or Beneficiary shall have power to sell,
    assign, transfer, encumber, or in any manner anticipate or
    dispose of the benefits to which he is entitled or may become
    entitled under a Plan Agreement.

    Section 5.5

         (a)  During the period that Participant is in Retirement
         or vested under Sections 8.5 or 10.2, Participant agrees
         that he will not, either directly or indirectly, within
         the United States of America or in any country of the
         world that Tandy (or Tandy Subsidiary) or one of its
         dealers or franchisees sells Consumer Electronic
         Products (as hereinafter defined) at retail, own,
         manage, operate, join, control, be employed by, be a
         consultant to, be a partner in, be a creditor of,
         engage in joint operations with, be a stockholder,
         officer or director of any corporation, sole
         proprietorship or business entity of any type, or
         participate in the ownership, management, direction, or
         control or in any other manner be connected with, any
         business selling Consumer Electronic Products at retail
         which is at the time of Participant's engaging in such
         conduct competitive with such products sold by Tandy at
         retail, except as a shareholder owning less than five
         percent (5%) of the shares of a corporation whose shares
         are traded on a stock exchange or in the
         over-the-counter market by a member of the National
         Association of Securities Dealers.  "Consumer Electronic
         Products" are those types of products sold at the retail
         level to the ultimate customer as are advertised by
         Tandy in its most recently published annual catalogs and
         monthly flyers.  Manufacturing of Consumer Electronic
         Products and sale of Consumer Electronic Products at
         levels of distribution other than the retail level are
         not considered a violation of this covenant.

         (b)  In the event that a Participant engages in any of
         the activities described in Section 5.5(a) Tandy will
         give notice to the Participant specifying in detail the
         alleged violation of Section 5.5(a).  Participant will
         be allowed ninety (90) days to cure such default.  If
         the Committee feels there is continuing competition,
         then, without any further notice or opportunity to cure,
         and upon determination by the Board of Directors that
         such a Participant is engaged in such activities, such
         Board's decision to be conclusive and binding upon all
         concerned, and notwithstanding any other provisions of
         the Plan or of the Plan Agreement with such Participant,
         Employer's obligation to a Participant to pay any
         benefits hereunder shall automatically cease and
         terminate, and Employer shall have no further obligation
         to such Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to the Plan
         or the Plan Agreement.  Employer may also enforce this
         provision by suit for damages which shall include but
         not be limited to all sums paid to Participant
         hereunder, or for injunction, or both.

    Section 5.6 Employer may liquidate out of the interest of a
    Participant hereunder, but only as death benefits become due
    and payable hereunder, any outstanding loan or loans or other
    indebtedness of a deceased Participant.  Employer may elect
    not to distribute death benefits to a Beneficiary unless and
    until all unpaid loans or other indebtedness due to Employer
    from such deceased Participant, together with interest, have
    been paid in full.

    Section 5.7 Subject to termination or amendment of the Plan,
    Plan Agreement, or both, a Participant's participation in the
    Plan shall continue during his Disability or his taking a
    Leave of Absence.  A Participant who is Disabled or on Leave
    of Absence shall notify Employer of his date of Retirement by
    notification in writing to the Committee at the address and
    as provided in Section 5.3 hereof.

                                ARTICLE SIX

                      AMENDMENTS OF PLAN AGREEMENTS

    Section 6.1 The Committee may enter into amendments to the
    Plan Agreement with any Participant for the purpose of
    increasing the benefits payable to Participant's Beneficiary
    in view of increases in his compensation following the
    execution of such Plan Agreement or the last amendment
    thereto and for the purpose of amending any provision of this
    Plan as it might apply to a Participant.  In such cases, the
    acceptance of an amendment by a Participant is voluntary and
    until the amended Plan Agreement has been submitted to and
    accepted by him, it shall not be effective.

                              ARTICLE SEVEN

                      BENEFICIARIES OF PARTICIPANTS

    Section 7.1 At the time of his acceptance of a Plan
    Agreement, a Participant shall be required to designate the
    Beneficiary to whom benefits under the Plan and his Plan
    Agreement will be payable upon his death.  A Beneficiary may
    be one or more persons or entities, such as dependents,
    persons who are natural objects of the Participant's bounty,
    an inter vivos or testamentary trust, or his estate.  Such
    Beneficiaries may be designated contingently or successively
    as the Participant may direct.  The designation of his
    Beneficiary shall be made by the Participant on a Beneficiary
    Designation Form to be furnished by the Committee and filed
    with it.

    Section 7.2 A Participant may change his Beneficiary, as he
    may desire, by filing new and amendatory Beneficiary
    Designation Forms with the Committee.

    Section 7.3 In the event a Participant designates more than
    one Beneficiary to receive benefit payments simultaneously,
    each such Beneficiary shall be paid such proportion of such
    benefits as the Participant shall have designated.  If no
    such percentage designation has been made, the Committee
    shall hold all benefit payments until the Beneficiaries agree
    as to the distribution of the funds or a judicial
    determination has been made.

    Section 7.4 If the designated Beneficiary dies before the
    Participant in question and no Beneficiary was successively
    named, or if the designated Beneficiary dies before complete
    payment of the deceased Participant's benefits have been made
    and no Beneficiary was successively named, the Committee
    shall direct that such benefits (or the balance thereof) be
    paid to those persons who are the deceased Participant's
    heirs-at-law determined in accordance with the laws of
    descent and distribution in force at the date hereof in the
    State of Texas for separate personal property, such
    determination to be made as though the Participant had died
    intestate and domiciled in Texas.

    Section 7.5 Whenever any person entitled to payments under
    this Plan shall be a minor or under other legal disability or
    in the sole judgment of the Committee shall otherwise be
    unable to apply such payments to his own best interest and
    advantage (as in the case of illness, whether mental or
    physical, or where the person not under legal disability is
    unable to preserve his estate for his own best interest), the
    Committee may in the exercise of its discretion direct all or
    any portion of such payments to be made in any one or more of
    the following ways unless claims shall have been made
    therefor by an existing and duly appointed guardian,
    conservator, committee or other duly appointed legal
    representative, in which event payment shall be made to such
    representative:

         (a)  directly to such person unless such person shall be
         an infant or shall have been legally adjudicated
         incompetent at the time of the payment;

         (b)  to the spouse, child, parent or other blood
         relative to be expended on behalf of the person entitled
         or on behalf of those dependents as to whom the person
         entitled has the duty of support;

         (c)  to a recognized charity or governmental institution
         to be expended for the benefit of the person entitled or
         for the benefit of those dependents as to whom the
         person entitled has the duty of support; or

         (d)  to any other institution, approved by the
         Committee, to be expended for the benefit of the person
         entitled or for the benefit of those dependents as to
         whom the person entitled has the duty of support.

    The decision of the Committee will, in each case, be final
    and binding upon all persons and the Committee shall not be
    obliged to see to the proper application or expenditure of
    any payments so made.  Any payment made pursuant to the power
    herein conferred upon the Committee shall operate as a
    complete discharge of the obligations of Employer and of the
    Committee.

    Section 7.6 If the Committee has any doubt as to the proper
    Beneficiary to receive payments hereunder, the Committee
    shall have the right to withhold such payments until the
    matter is finally adjudicated, or the Committee may direct
    Employer to bring a suit for interpleader in any appropriate
    court, pay any amounts due into court, and Employer and/or
    Committee shall have the right to recover its reasonable
    attorney's fees from such proceeds so paid or to be paid. 
    Any payment made by the Committee, in good faith and in
    accordance with this Plan, shall fully discharge the
    Committee and Employer from all further obligations with
    respect to such payments.

                              ARTICLE EIGHT

                      TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION

    Section 8.1 Except as provided in Sections 8.4, 8.5, 10.1 and
    10.2 hereof, termination of a Participant's employment by
    Employer other than by reason of Retirement, Disability or
    Leave of Absence, whether by action of Employer or the
    Participant's resignation, shall terminate the Participant's
    participation in the Plan.  Neither the Plan nor the Plan
    Agreement shall in any way obligate Employer to continue the
    employment of a Participant, nor will either limit the right
    of Employer to terminate a Participant's employment at any
    time, for any reason, with or without cause.

    Section 8.2 Except as provided in Sections 8.4, 8.5, 10.1 and

    also terminate if the Plan or his Plan Agreement is
    terminated by Tandy in accordance with Article Ten.

    Section 8.3 Except as provided in Sections 8.4, 8.5, 10.1 and
    10.2, hereof, upon termination of a Participant's
    participation in the Plan, all of Employer's obligations to
    the Participant and his Beneficiary under the Plan and Plan
    Agreement and each of them, shall terminate and be of no
    further effect.

    Section 8.4 Except as provided in Sections 8.5, 10.1 and
    10.2, if a Participant's participation in the Plan is
    terminated by:

         (a)  termination of the Plan;

              (ii) Indictment of a Participant for a felony crime
                   involving moral turpitude (in which event no
                   vesting of Section 8.4(a) or (b) or 10.1
                   shall occur).

    then upon death after Retirement of the Participant, such
    ceased Participant's Beneficiary shall be entitled, as set

    Plan Agreement as follows:


        Age Attained at Date of Event
       Set Forth in Section 8.4(a), (b)
                  or (c)                         % Vested

             Age 54 or younger                       0%

             Age 55 to age 65             A percent as determined
                                         in Section 5.1(b) hereof

             Age 65 to age 70                      100%

             Age 70 to age 75             A percent as determined
                                         in Section 5.1(c) hereof

             Age 75 and thereafter                   0%

    The amount payable under this Section 8.4 shall be determined
    as of the date of the event set forth in Section 8.4 (a), (b)
    or (c) hereof and such amount as so determined at that time
    shall not be altered or changed thereafter except that the
    provisions of Section 5.5 hereof shall remain fully
    applicable.  The amount payable under this Section 8.4 shall
    be paid as set forth in Section 5.3 hereunder.  No benefits
    shall be payable under this Section 8.4 if Participant is
    employed by employer at the date of his death.

    Section 8.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
    Plan or Plan Agreement,

         (a)  In the event of a Change in Control, as hereinafter
         defined, every Participant immediately shall be vested
         with the full amount set forth in his Plan Agreement
         without regard to Section 5.1(b) but subject to Section
         5.1(c).  Such Plan Agreement Amount shall be payable to
         the Participant's Beneficiary in a lump sum on the
         first day of the month next following the date on which
         such Participant dies.  Such lump sum payment shall
         equal the present value of the Participant's Plan
         Agreement Amount discounted at the Pension Benefit
         Guaranty Corporation's Immediate Annuity Rate used to
         value benefits for single-employer plans terminating on
         the date of the Participant's death, compounded
         semi-annually.

         (b)  Any Beneficiary who, on the date of the Change in
         Control, was receiving benefits under the Plan or Plan
         Agreement shall be entitled to receive a lump sum equal
         to the present value of the Beneficiary's remaining
         amount set forth in the Plan Agreement, calculated in a
         manner consistent with Section 8.5(a).

    Section 8.6 In the event that a Participant's employment with
    Employer is involuntarily terminated for any reason other
    than those reasons set forth in Section 8.4(c)(i) and (ii),
    and within a one-year period beginning on the date of such
    termination there occurs a Change in Control, then such
    Participant's Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a lump
    sum equal to the present value of the amount set forth in the
    Participant's Plan Agreement (calculated in a manner
    consistent with Section 8.5(a), payable on the first day of
    the month next following the Participant's death.

    Section 8.7 For purposes of the Plan, "Change in Control"
    shall mean any of the following terms:

         (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from Tandy) of
         any voting securities of Tandy (the "Voting Securities")
         by any "Person" (as the term person is used for purposes
         of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
         of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) immediately after
         which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
         meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of
         fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting
         power of Tandy's then outstanding Voting Securities;
         provided, however, in determining whether a Change in
         Control has occurred, Voting Securities which are
         acquired in a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter
         defined) shall not constitute an acquisition which would
         cause a Change in Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition"
         shall mean an acquisition by (1) an employee benefit
         plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by
         (a) Tandy or (b) any corporation or other Person of
         which a majority of its voting power or its voting
         equity securities or equity interest is owned, directly
         or indirectly, by Tandy (for purposes of this Sectin
         8.7, a "Tandy Subsidiary"), (2) Tandy or its
         Subsidiaries, or (3) any Person in connection with a
         "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter defined).

         (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990, are
         members of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for
         any reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the
         Board; provided, however, that if the election, or
         nomination for election by Tandy's stockholders, of any
         new director was approved by a vote of at least
         two-thirds of the Incumbent Board, such new director
         shall, for purposes of the Plan, be considered as a
         member of the Incumbent Board; provided further,
         however, that no individual shall be considered a member
         of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially
         assumed office as a result of either an actual or
         threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule
         14a-11 promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual
         or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or
         on behalf of a Person other than the Board (a "Proxy
         Contest") including by reason of any agreement intended
         to avoid or settle any Election Contest or Proxy
         Contest; or

         (c)  Approval by stockholders of Tandy of:

              (1)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization
              involving Tandy, unless

                   (i)  the stockholders of Tandy, immediately
                   before such merger, consolidation or
                   reorganization, own, directly or indirectly
                   immediately following such merger,
                   consolidation or reorganization, at least
                   sixty percent (60%) of the combined voting
                   power of the outstanding voting securities of           
                   the corporation resulting from such merger or
                   consolidation or reorganization (the
                   "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the
                   same proportion as their ownership of the
                   Voting Securities immediately before such
                   merger, consolidation or reorganization,

                   (ii)  the individuals who were members of the
                   Incumbent Board immediately prior to the
                   execution of the agreement providing for such
                   merger, consolidation or reorganization
                   constitute at least two-thirds of the members
                   of the board of directors of the Surviving
                   Corporation,

                   (iii)  no Person [other than Tandy, any
                   Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan (or any
                   trust forming a part thereof) maintained by
                   Tandy, the Surviving Corporation, or any Tandy
                   Subsidiary, or any Person who, immediately
                   prior to such merger, consolidation or
                   reorganization had Beneficial Ownership of
                   fifteen percent (15%) or more of the then
                   outstanding Voting Securities] has Beneficial
                   Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of
                   the combined voting power of the Surviving
                   Corporation's then outstanding voting
                   securities, and

                   (iv)  a transaction described in clauses (i)
                   through (iii) shall herein be referred to as a
                   "Non-Control Transaction";

                   (v)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of
                   Tandy; or

                   (vi)  An agreement for the sale or other
                   disposition of all or substantially all of the
                   assets of the Company to any Person (other
                   than a transfer to a Tandy Subsidiary).
     
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall
    not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the
    "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than
    the permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as
    a result of the acquisition of Votin Securities by Tandy
    which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by Tandy, and after such share acquisition by Tandy, the
    Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional
    Voting Securities which increases the percentage of the then
    outstanding Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by the
    Subject Person, then a Change in Control shall occur.

    Section 8.8 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
    the Plan, upon a Change in Control, the provisions of
    Sections 5.5 and 5.6 shall lapse and become null and void.

                            ARTICLE NINE

                      ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

    Section 9.1 The Plan shall be administered by the
    Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors of Tandy, as it is presently constituted or as it
    may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors.

    Section 9.2 In addition to the express powers and authorities
    accorded the Committee under the Plan, it shall be
    responsible for:

         (a)  Construing and interpreting the Plan;

         (b)  Computing and certifying to Employer the amount of
         benefits to be provided in each Plan Agreement for the
         Beneficiary of the Participant; and

         (c)  Determining the right of a Beneficiary to payments
         under the Plan and otherwise authorizing disbursements
         of such payments by Employer;

    in these and all other respects its decisions shall be
    conclusive and binding upon all concerned.

    Section 9.3 Employer agrees to hold harmless and indemnify
    the members of the Committee against any and all expenses,
    claims, and causes of action by or on behalf of any and all
    parties whomsoever, and all losses therefrom, including
    without limitation the cost of defense and attorneys' fees,
    based upon or arising out of any act or omission relating to
    or in connection with the Plan other than losses resulting
    from any such Committee member's fraud or willful misconduct.

                             ARTICLE TEN

                TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN
                         OR PLAN AGREEMENT

    Section 10.1 Employer reserves the right to terminate or
    amend this Plan or any Plan Agreement, in whole or in part,
    at any time, or from time to time, by resolution of the Board
    of Directors of Tandy, provided, however, no amendment to the
    Plan or to any Plan Agreement shall alter the vested rights
    of a Participant or Beneficiary applicable on the effective
    date of such termination or amendment and, except for
    increases in Plan compensation as provided in Section 8.5
    hereof, such vested rights shall remain unchanged.  Rights
    are deemed to have vested if benefits are actually being paid
    or if the only condition precedent to the payment of benefits
    is the death of a Participant (unless his employment was
    terminated for reasons set forth in Section 8.4(c)(i) and
    (ii), in which event all benefits are forfeited) with
    Employer or the giving of notice of Retirement or the
    occurrence of an event described in Section 8.5(a), (b) or
    (c).

    Section 10.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
    Plan or Plan Agreement, 

         (a)  Sections 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8 and this Section 10.2
         shall not be amended or terminated at any time.

         (b)  For a period of one year following a Change in
         Control, the Plan or Plan Agreement shall not be
         terminated or amended in any way, nor shall the manner
         in which the Plan is administered be changed in a way
         that adversely affects the Participants' or
         Beneficiary's right to existing or future Tandy
         provided benefits or contributions provided hereunder,
         including, but not limited to, any change in, or to, the
         eligibility requirements, benefit formulae and manner
         and optional forms of payments.

         (c)  Any amendment or termination of the Plan or Plan
         Agreement prior to a Change in Control which (i) was at
         the request of a third party who has indicated an
         intention or taken steps reasonably calculated to effect
         a Change in control or (ii) otherwise arose in
         connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in
         Control, shall be null and void and shall have no effect
         whatsoever.

         (d)  In the event the Plan or any Plan Agreement is
         terminated or adversely amended to the detriment of any
         Participant or Beneficiary and within a one-year period
         from the effective date of any such amendment or
         termination a Change in Control occurs, then the
         Beneficiaries of any Participant whose employment with
         Employer is terminated, voluntarily or involuntarily,
         within a three-year period from the date of the Change
         in Control shall be entitled to receive those benefits
         set forth in Section 8.5 hereof to the same extent and
         in the same amounts as though such amendment or
         termination had not occurred.  This Section 10.2(e)
         shall not apply to any Beneficiary of any Participant
         who, on the date of the Change in Control, has
         previously retired or has otherwise voluntarily
         terminated his employment with Employer.

                                ARTICLE ELEVEN

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

    the entire Plan Agreement, not to any particular provision,
    section or subsection, and words used in the singular or
    plural may be construed as though in the plural or singular

    Section 11.5 This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the
    benefit of any successor of Employer and any such successor
    shall be deemed substituted for Employer under the terms of
    this Plan.  As used in this Plan, the term "successor" shall
    include any person, firm, corporation, or other business
    entity which at any time, whether by merger, purchase, or
    otherwise, acquires all or substantially all of the assets or
    business of Employer.

    carriers or any reinsurance thereof successfully avoid(s)
    payment to Tandy of the proceeds of its or their policy or
    policies, or such proceeds are not payable because the
    Participant's death results from suicide within two (2) years
    of the issuance of such policy or within two (2) years of the
    issuance to Tandy of additional policies obtained by Tandy
    hereunder, then, in any of said events, notwithstanding any
    other provisions of the Plan or of the Plan Agreement with
    such Participant, Tandy shall have no obligation to his
    Beneficiary to provide any of the death benefits otherwise
    payable under the terms thereof.

    Section 4.3 Each Participant shall cooperate in the securing
    of life insurance on his life by furnishing such information
    as the insurance company may require, taking such physical
    examinations as may be necessary, and taking any other action
    which may be requested by Tandy or the insurance company to
    obtain such insurance coverage.  If a Participant refuses to
    cooperate in the securing of life insurance, or if Tandy is
    unable to secure life insurance at standard rates on a
    Participant, then the Plan Agreement shall be of no force and
    effect as to a Participant unless Tandy waives such
    requirement in writing.

    Section 4.4 All benefits under the Plan or Plan Agreement
    represent an unsecured promise to pay by Tandy Corporation. 
    The Plan shall be unfunded and the benefits hereunder shall
    be paid only from the general assets of Tandy Corporation
    resulting in the Participants having no greater rights than
    Tandy Corporation's general creditors; provided, however,
    nothing herein shall prevent or prohibit Tandy Corporation
    from establishing a trust or other arrangement for the
    purpose of providing for the payment of the benefits payable
    under the Plan or Plan Agreement.


                             ARTICLE FIVE

                  BENEFITS PAYABLE TO PARTICIPANTS AND
                    TO BENEFICIARIES OF PARTICIPANTS

    Section 5.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
    upon the Retirement of a Participant, Tandy agrees to pay to
    Participant a Retirement benefit as follows:

         (a)  Normal Retirement.  If a Participant retires at the
    date of Normal Retirement, then Tandy agrees to pay to
    Participant or to the designated Beneficiary of Participant
    in the event of the death of Participant prior to the
    termination of payment of Retirement benefits hereunder, all
    from its general assets, an amount equal to such
    Participant's Plan Benefit Amount, such sum to be paid as set
    forth in Section 5.3 hereof.

         (b)  Early Retirement.  If a Participant retires at a
    time that constitutes an Early Retirement, then Tandy agrees
    to pay to Participant or to the designated Beneficiary of
    Participant in the event of the death of Participant prior to
    the termination of payment of Early Retirement benefits
    hereunder, all from its general assets, an amount equal to
    such Participant's Plan Benefit Amount, reduced by five
    percent (5%) per year for each year that Early Retirement
    precedes the date of Normal Retirement.  Such year shall be a
    fiscal year beginning on the date a Participant attains age
    fifty-five (55).  Any reduction for a part of a year shall be
    prorated on a daily basis assuming a 365-day year.  Such
    amount shall be paid as set forth in Section 5.3 hereof.

         (c)  Late Retirement.  If a Participant retires at a
    date that constitutes Late Retirement, then Tandy agrees to
    pay to Participant or to the designated Beneficiary of
    Participant in the event of the death of Participant prior to
    the termination of payment of Late Retirement benefits
    hereunder, all from its general assets, an amount equal to
    such Participant's Plan Benefit Amount, reduced by a
    percentage determined as follows:

             Age on Date of             Percent of Reduction
            Late Retirement            of Plan Benefit Amount

                  66                             0%
                  67                             0%
                  68                             0%
                  69                             0%
                  70                             0%
                  71                            20%
                  72                            40%
                  73                            60%
                  74                            80%
                  75                           100%

    The percent of reduction of a Participant's Plan Benefit
    Amount shall be measured on a fiscal year beginning on the
    date of Participant's date of birth and shall commence on the
    day after the date a Participant attains age 70, and any
    reduction for a part of a year shall be prorated on a daily
    basis at the applicable percentage assuming a 365-day year. 
    Such amount shall be paid as set forth in Section 5.3 hereof.

    Section 5.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
    upon the death of a Participant, but only if the Participant
    is an Employee of Tandy at his death (except as set forth in
    Section 5.2(c) below) and is not being paid benefits pursuant
    to a Plan Agreement at such time, Tandy agrees to pay to his
    Beneficiary from its general assets an amount equal to such
    Participant's Plan Benefit Amount as reflected in Employee's
    Plan Agreement or, as the case may be, in the last amendment
    to his Plan Agreement.  With respect to such benefits,
    however, it is further provided that:

         (a)  no benefits shall be payable to the Beneficiary of
    a Participant in those instances covered by Section 4.2;

         (b)  if a Participant dies while an Employee of Tandy
    after the date of his Normal Retirement, then the amount
    payable to his Beneficiary upon a Participant's death shall
    be reduced as set forth in Section 5.1(c) hereof.

         (c)  The death of a Participant within the first year
    after involuntary termination of employment with Tandy as
    provided in Section 8.6 shall not defeat the right of such
    Participant's Beneficiary to receive benefits under this
    Section 5.2 so long as an event described in Section 8.5(a),
    (b) or (c) occurs within one year of the date of termination
    of the Participant's employment.

    Section 5.3 Except as provided in Section 8.5, the aggregate
    amount payable upon the Normal Retirement, Early Retirement,
    Late Retirement benefits due and payable under Section 8.5 or
    8.6 hereof, or death of a Participant to a Participant or his
    Beneficiary shall be paid in one hundred twenty (120) equal
    monthly installments commencing on the first day of the month
    next following thirty (30) days after Retirement or after the
    Committee's receipt of a certified death or proof of death
    certificate verifying the Participant's death, or at the time
    stated in Section 8.5 or 8.6 hereof.  A Participant shall
    notify Tandy of Retirement by hand delivery or by certified
    or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage
    prepaid, of a written notice of Retirement specifying the
    effective date of Retirement, such written notice to be
    addressed to: Insurance Committee of the Board of Directors,
    Tandy Corporation, 1800 One Tandy Center, Fort Worth, Texas
    76102.  Such notice shall be deemed to be received when
    actually received by said Insurance Committee at said address
    as may be changed from time to time in the Plan Agreements,
    as amended.

    Section 5.4 Until actually paid and delivered to the
    Participant or to the Beneficiary entitled to same, none of
    the benefits payable by Tandy under any Plan Agreement shall
    be liable for the debts or liabilities of either the
    Participant or his Beneficiary, nor shall the same be subject
    to seizure by any creditor of the Participant or his
    Beneficiary under any writ or proceeding at law, in equity or
    in Bankruptcy.  Further, no Participant or Beneficiary shall
    have power to sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or in any
    manner anticipate or dispose of the benefits to which he is
    entitled or may become entitled under a Plan Agreement.

    Section 5.5
         (a)  During the period that Participant is receiving
    benefits under a Plan Agreement and for one (1) year after
    cessation of payment of benefits, Participant agrees that he
    will not, either directly or indirectly, within the United
    States of America or in any country of the world that Tandy
    (or a Tandy Subsidiary) or one of its dealers or franchisees
    sells Consumer Electronic Products (as hereinafter defined)
    at retail, own, manage, operate, join, control, be employed
    by, be a consultant to, be a partner in, be a creditor of,
    engage in joint operations with, be a stockholder, officer or
    director of any corporation, sole proprietorship or business
    entity of any type, or participate in the ownership,
    management, direction, or control or in any other manner be
    connected with, any business selling Consumer Electronic
    Products at retail which is at the time of Participant's
    engaging in such conduct competitive with such products sold
    by Tandy at retail, except as a stockholder owning less than
    five percent (5%) of the shares of a corporation whose shares
    are traded on a stock exchange or in the over-the-counter
    market by a member of the National Association of Securities
    Dealers.  "Consumer Electronic Products" are those type of
    products sold at the retail level to the ultimate customer as
    are advertised by Tandy in its most recently published annual
    catalogs and monthly flyers.  Manufacturing of Consumer
    Electronic Products and sale of Consumer Electronic Products
    at levels of distribution other than the retail level are not
    considered a violation of this covenant.

         (b)  In the event that a Participant engages in any of
    the activities described in Section 5.5(a) Tandy will give
    notice to the Participant specifying in detail the alleged
    violation of Section 5.5(a).  Participant will be allowed
    ninety (90) days to cure such default.  If the Committee
    feels there is continuing competition, then, without any
    further notice or opportunity to cure, and upon determination
    by the Board of Directors that such a Participant is engaged
    in such activities, such Board's decision to be conclusive
    and binding upon all concerned, and notwithstanding any other
    provisions of the Plan or of the Plan Agreement with such
    Participant, Tandy's obligation to a Participant to pay any
    benefits hereunder shall automatically cease and terminate
    and Tandy shall have no further obligation to such
    Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to the Plan or the Plan
    Agreement.  Tandy may also enforce this provision by suit for
    damages which shall include but not be limited to all sums
    paid to Participant hereunder, or for injunction, or both.

    Section 5.6 Tandy may liquidate out of the interest of a
    Participant hereunder, but only as Retirement or death
    benefits become due and payable hereunder, any outstanding
    loan or loans or other indebtedness of a Participant.  Tandy
    may elect not to distribute Retirement or death benefits to
    any Participant or to a Beneficiary unless and until all
    unpaid loans or other indebtedness due to Tandy from such
    Participant, together with interest, have been paid in full.

    Section 5.7 Subject to termination or amendment of the Plan,
    Plan Agreement, or both, a Participant's participation in the
    Plan shall continue during his Disability or his taking a
    Leave of Absence.  A Participant who is Disabled or on Leave
    of Absence shall notify Tandy of his date of Retirement as
    provided in Section 5.3 hereof.


                             ARTICLE SIX
                   AMENDMENTS OF PLAN AGREEMENTS

    Section 6.1 The Committee may enter into amendments to the
    Plan Agreement with any Participant for the purpose of
    increasing the benefits payable to the Participant or his
    Beneficiary in view of increases in his compensation
    following the execution of such Plan Agreement or the last
    amendment thereto and for the purpose of amending any
    provision of this Plan as it might apply to a Participant. 
    In such cases, the acceptance of an amendment by a
    Participant is voluntary and until the amended Plan Agreement
    has been submitted to and accepted by him, it shall not be
    effective.


                            ARTICLE SEVEN

                    BENEFICIARIES OF PARTICIPANTS

    Section 7.1 At the time of his acceptance of a Plan
    Agreement, a Participant shall be required to designate the
    Beneficiary to whom benefits under the Plan and his Plan
    Agreement will be payable upon his death.  A Beneficiary may
    be one (1) or more persons or entities, such as dependents,
    persons who are natural objects of the Participant's bounty,
    an inter vivos or testamentary trust, or his estate.  Such
    Beneficiaries may be designated contingently or successively
    as the Participant may direct.  The designation of his
    Beneficiary shall be made by the Participant on a Beneficiary
    Designation Form to be furnished by the Committee and filed
    with it.

    Section 7.2 A Participant may change his Beneficiary, as he
    may desire, by filing new and amendatory Beneficiary
    Designation Forms with the Committee.

    Section 7.3 In the event a Participant designates more than
    one (1) Beneficiary to receive benefit payments
    simultaneously, each such Beneficiary shall be paid such
    proportion of such benefits as the Participant shall have
    designated.  If no such percentage designation has been made,
    the Committee shall hold all benefit payments until the
    Beneficiaries agree as to the distribution of the funds or a
    judicial determination has been made.

    Section 7.4 If the designated Beneficiary dies before the
    Participant in question and no Beneficiary was successively
    named, or if the designated Beneficiary dies before complete
    payment of the deceased Participant's benefits have been made
    and no Beneficiary was successively named, the Committee
    shall direct that such benefits (or the balance thereof) be
    paid to those persons who are the deceased Participant's
    heirs-at-law determined in accordance with the laws of
    descent and distribution in force at the date hereof in the
    State of Texas for separate personal property, such
    determination to be made as though the Participant had died
    intestate and domiciled in Texas.

    Section 7.5 Whenever any person entitled to payments under
    this Plan shall be a minor or under other legal disability or
    in the sole judgment of the Committee shall otherwise be
    unable to apply such payments to his own best interest and
    advantage (as in the case of illness, whether mental or
    physical, or where the person not under legal disability is
    unable to preserve his estate for his own best interest), the
    Committee may in the exercise of its discretion direct all or
    any portion of such payments to be made in any one or more of
    the following ways unless claims shall have been made
    therefor by an existing and duly appointed guardian,
    conservator, committee or other duly appointed legal
    representative, in which event payment shall be made to such
    representative:

         (1)  directly to such person unless such person shall be
    an infant or shall have been legally adjudicated incompetent
    at the time of the payment;

         (2)  to the spouse, child, parent or other blood
    relative to be expended on behalf of the person entitled or
    on behalf of those dependents as to whom the person entitled
    has the duty of support;

         (3)  to a recognized charity or governmental institution
    to be expended for the benefit of the person entitled or for
    the benefit of those dependents as to whom the person
    entitled has the duty of support; or

         (4)  to any other institution, approved by the
    Committee, to be expended for the benefit of the person
    entitled or for the benefit of those dependents as to whom
    the person entitled has the duty of support.

    The decision of the Committee will, in each case, be final
    and binding upon all persons and the Committee shall not be
    obligated to see to the proper application or expenditure of
    any payments so made.  Any payment made pursuant to the power
    herein conferred upon the Committee shall operate as a
    complete discharge of the obligations of Tandy and of the
    Committee.

    Section 7.6 If the Committee has any doubt as to the proper
    Beneficiary to receive payments hereunder, the Committee
    shall have the right to withhold such payments until the
    matter is finally adjudicated or the Committee may direct
    Tandy to bring a suit for interpleader in any appropriate
    court, pay any amounts due into the court, and Tandy shall
    have the right to recover its reasonable attorney's fees from
    such proceeds so paid or to be paid.  Any payment made by the
    Committee, in good faith and in accordance with this Plan,
    shall fully discharge the Committee and Tandy from all
    further obligations with respect to such payments.


                         ARTICLE EIGHT

                  TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION

    Section 8.1 Except as provided in Sections 8.4, 8.5, 8.6,
    10.1, and 10.2 hereof, termination of a Participant's
    employment by Tandy other than by reason of Retirement,
    Permanent Disability or Leave of Absence, whether by action
    of Tandy or the Participant's resignation, shall terminate
    the Participant's participation in the Plan.  Neither the
    Plan nor the Plan Agreement shall in any way obligate Tandy
    to continue the employment of a Participant, nor will either
    limit the right of Tandy to terminate a Participant's
    employment at any time, for any reason, with or without
    cause.

    Section 8.2 Except as provided in Sections 8.4, 8.5, 8.6,
    10.1 and 10.2 hereof, participation in the Plan by a
    Participant shall also terminate if the Plan or his Plan
    Agreement is terminated by Tandy in accordance with Article
    Ten.

    Section 8.3 Except as provided in Sections 8.4, 8.5, 8.6,
    10.1, and 10.2 hereof, upon termination of a Participant's
    participation in the Plan, all of Tandy's obligations to the
    Participant and his Beneficiary under the Plan and Plan
    Agreement and each of them, shall terminate and be of no
    further effect.

    Section 8.4 Except as provided in Sections 8.5, 8.6, 10.1 and
    10.2, if a Participant's participation in the Plan is
    terminated, by:

         (a)  termination of the Plan;

         (b)  termination of a Plan Agreement; or

         (c)  termination of employment for any reasons other
    than

         (i)  death or Retirement, which shall be governed by
    Article Five, or

         (ii)  dishonest or fraudulent conduct of a Participant
    or indictment of a Participant for a felony crime involving
    moral turpitude, in which event no vesting under Section 8.4,
    8.6, 10.1, or 10.2 shall occur, 

    then such Participant shall be entitled, as set forth below,
    to a percentage of his Plan Benefit Amount as follows:

       Age Attained at Date of Event Set
      Forth in Section 8.4(a), (b) or (c)        % Vested

               Age 54 or younger                      0%

               Age 55 to age 65           A percent as determined
                                             in 5.1(b) hereof

               Age 65 to age 70                     100%

               Age 70 to age 75           A percent as determined
                                             in 5.1(c) hereto

               Age 75 and thereafter                   0%

         The amount payable under this Section 8.4 shall be
    determined as of the date of the event set forth in Section
    8.4(a), (b) or (c) hereof and such amount as so determined at
    that time shall not be altered or changed thereafter except
    that the provisions of Section 5.5 hereof shall remain fully
    applicable during the Participant's employment by Tandy,
    during the payment of benefits under this Section 8.4 and for
    one (1) year after termination of employment or payment of
    benefits.  The amount payable under this Section 8.4 shall be
    paid as set forth in Section 5.3 hereunder to commence on the
    first day of the month next following thirty (30) days after
    cessation of Participant's employment with Tandy.

    Section 8.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
    Plan,

         (a)  In the event of a "Change in Control" (as
    hereinafter defined), every Participant immediately shall be
    vested with his Plan Benefit Amount determined without regard
    to Section 5.1(b) but subject to Section 5.1(c).  Such
    retirement benefit shall be payable in a lump sum on the
    first day of the month next following the date on which such
    Participant's employment with Tandy Corporation terminates
    for any reason (the "Termination Date").  Such lump sum
    payment shall equal the present value of the Participant's
    Plan Benefit Amount discounted for interest only at the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's Immediate Annuity Rate
    used to value benefits for single-employer plans terminating
    on the Termination Date, compounded semi-annually.

         (b)  Any Participant or Beneficiary who on the date of a
    Change in Control was receiving benefits under the Plan shall
    be entitled to receive a lump sum equal to the present value
    of the remaining Plan Benefit Amount, payable on the first
    day of the month next following the date of the Change in
    Control, calculated in a manner consistent with Section
    8.5(a).

    Section 8.6 In the event that a Participant's employment with
    Tandy Corporation is involuntarily terminated for any reason
    other than those reasons set forth in Section 8.4(c)(ii), and
    within a one-year period beginning on the date of such
    termination there occurs a Change in Control, then such
    Participant, or his Beneficiary if such Participant dies
    after termination of employment, shall be entitled to receive
    a lump sum equal to the present value of the Participant's
    Plan Benefit Amount (determined in a manner consistent with
    Section 8.5(a)), payable in a lump sum on the first day of
    the month next following the date of the Change in Control.

    Section 8.7 For purposes of the Program, "Change in Control"
    shall mean any of the following events:

         (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from Tandy
    Corporation) of any voting securities of Tandy Corporation
    (the "Voting Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person
    is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"))
    immediately after which such Person has "Beneficial
    Ownership" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
    under the 1934 Act) of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
    combined voting power of Tandy Corporation's then outstanding
    Voting Securities; provided, however, in determining whether
    a Change in Control has occurred, Voting Securities which are
    acquired in a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter
    defined) shall not constitute an acquisition which would
    cause a Change in Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall
    mean an acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a
    trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (a) Tandy
    Corporation or (b) any corporation or other Person of which a
    majority of its voting power or its voting equity securities
    or equity interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by Tandy
    Corporation (for purposes of this Section 8.7, a "Tandy
    Subsidiary"), (2) Tandy Corporation or its Tandy
    Subsidiaries, or (3) any Person in connection with a
    "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter defined).

         (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990, are
    members of the board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any
    reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the Board;
    provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for
    election by Tandy Corporation's stockholders, of any new
    director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
    Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of the
    Plan, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board;
    provided further, however, that no individual shall be
    considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
    initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or
    threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11
    promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

         (c)  Approval by stockholders of Tandy Corporation of:

              (1)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization
    involving Tandy Corporation, unless

                   (i)  the stockholders of Tandy Corporation,
    immediately before such merger, consolidation or
    reorganization, own, directly or indirectly immediately
    following such merger, consolidation or reorganization, at
    least sixty percent (60%) of the combined voting power of the
    outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting
    from such merger or consolidation or reorganization (the
    "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the same proportion
    as their ownership of the Voting Securities immediately
    before such merger, consolidation or reorganization,

                   (ii)  the individuals who were members of the
    Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the
    agreement providing for such merger, consolidation or
    reorganization constitute at least two-thirds of the members
    of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation,

                   (iii)  no Person (other than Tandy
    Corporation, any Tandy Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan
    (or any trust forming part thereof) maintained by Tandy
    Corporation, the Surviving Corporation, or any Tandy
    Subsidiary, or any Person who, immediately prior to such
    merger, consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial
    Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the then
    outstanding Voting Securities) has Beneficial Ownership of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the combined voting power of the Surviving Corporation's then
    outstanding voting securities, and

                   (iv)  a transaction described in clauses (i)
    through (iii) shall herein be referred to as a "Non-Control
    Transaction";

              (2)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of Tandy
    Corporation; or

              (3)  An agreement for the sale or other disposition
    of all or substantially all of the assets of Tandy
    Corporation to any Person (other than a transfer to a Tandy
    Subsidiary).

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall
    not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the
    "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than
    the permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as
    a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by Tandy
    Corporation which, by reducing the number of Voting
    Securities outstanding, increases the proportional number of
    shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided
    that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the
    operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of
    Voting Securities by Tandy Corporation, and after such share
    acquisition by Tandy Corporation, the Subject Person becomes
    the Beneficial Owner of any additional Voting Securities
    which increases the percentage of the then outstanding Voting
    Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a
    Change in Control shall occur.

    Section 8.8 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
    the Plan, upon a Change in Control, the provisions of
    Sections 5.5 and 5.6 shall lapse and become null and void.


                           ARTICLE NINE

                    ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

    Section 9.1 The Plan shall be administered by the Insurance
    Committee of the Board of Directors of Tandy, as it is
    presently constituted or as it may be changed from time to
    time by the Board of Directors of Tandy.

    Section 9.2 In addition to the express powers and authorities
    accorded the Committee under the Plan, it shall be
    responsible for:

         (a)  construing and interpreting the Plan;

         (b)  computing and certifying to Tandy the amount of
    benefits to be provided in each Plan Agreement for the
    Participant or the Beneficiary of the Participant; and

         (c)  determining the right of a Participant or a
    Beneficiary to payments under the Plan and otherwise
    authorizing disbursements of such payments by Tandy;

    in these and all other respects its decisions shall be
    conclusive and binding upon all concerned.

    Section 9.3 Tandy agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the
    members of the Committee against any and all expenses, claims
    and causes of action by or on behalf of any and all parties
    whomsoever, and all losses therefrom, including without
    limitation the cost of defense and attorney's fees, based
    upon or arising out of any act or omission relating to or in
    connection with the Plan other than losses resulting from any
    such Committee member's fraud or willful misconduct.


                             ARTICLE TEN

                TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN
                         OR PLAN AGREEMENTS

    Section 10.1 Tandy reserves the right to terminate or amend
    this Plan or any Plan Agreement, in whole or in part, at any
    time, from time to time, by resolution of the Board of
    Directors of Tandy, provided, however, no amendment to the
    Plan or to any Plan Agreement shall alter the vested rights
    of a Participant or Beneficiary applicable on the effective
    date of such termination or amendment and, except for
    increases in Plan Compensation as provided in Section 8.5
    hereof, such vested rights shall remain unchanged.  Rights
    are deemed to have vested if benefits are actually being paid
    or if the only condition precedent to the payment of benefits
    is the termination of employment (unless terminated for
    reasons set forth in Section 8.4(c)(ii), in which event
    benefits are forfeited) with Tandy or the giving of notice of
    Retirement or the occurrence of an event described in Section
    8.5(a), (b) or (c).

    Section 10.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
    Plan,

         (a)  Sections 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8 and this Section 10.2
    shall not be amended or terminated at any time.

         (b)  For a period of one (1) year following a Change in
    Control, the Plan or Plan Agreement shall not be terminated
    or amended in any way, nor shall the manner in which the Plan
    is administered be changed in a way that adversely affects
    the Participants' right to existing or future Tandy
    Corporation provided benefits or contributions provided
    hereunder, including, but not limited to, any change in, or
    to, the eligibility requirements, benefit formulae and manner
    and optional forms of payments.

         (c)  Any amendment or termination of the Plan prior to a
    Change in Control which (i) was at the request of a third
    party who has indicated an intention or taken steps
    reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or (ii)
    otherwise arose in connection with, or in anticipation of, a
    Change in Control, shall be null and void and shall have no
    effect whatsoever.

         (d)  In the event the Plan or any Plan Agreement is
    terminated or adversely amended to the detriment of any
    Participant and within a one-year period from the effective
    date of any such amendment or termination a Change in Control
    occurs, then any Participant so affected whose employment
    with Tandy Corporation is terminated, voluntarily or
    involuntarily, within a three-year period from the date of
    the Change in Control shall be entitled to receive those
    benefits set forth in Section 8.5 hereof to the same extent
    and in the same amounts as though such amendment or
    termination had not occurred.  This Section 10.2(d) shall not
    apply to any Participant who, on the date of the Change in
    Control, has previously retired or has otherwise voluntarily
    terminated his employment with Tandy Corporation.


                               ARTICLE ELEVEN

    under the laws of the State of Texas.

    Section 11.2 The masculine gender, where appearing in the
    Plan or Plan Agreement, shall be deemed to include the
    feminine gender.  The words "herein", "hereunder" and other
    similar compounds of the word "here" shall mean and refer to
    the entire Plan and Plan Agreement, not to any particular
    provision, section or subsection, and words used in the
    singular or plural may be construed as though in the plural

    include any person, firm, corporation, or other business
    entity which at any time, whether by merger, purchase, or
    otherwise, acquires all or substantially all of the assets or
    business of Tandy.

    Section 11.6 A Participant shall not be required to mitigate
    the amount of any payment provided for in this Plan by

    party, shall be entitled to recover from Tandy all actual
    expenses incurred in the prosecution of said suit including
    but not limited to attorneys' fees, court costs, and all
    other actual expenses.

    Section 11.8 Notwithstanding all other provisions in the
    Plan, in the event a Participant is entitled to benefits
    under two (2) separate sections of the Plan, the maximum a
    Participant may receive under this Plan is his Plan Benefit
    Amount, payable in accordance with Section 5.3 hereof.

    The original Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on
    June 27, 1986.  This restated plan includes amendments
    thereto pursuant to resolutions at meetings of the Board of
    Directors of Tandy Corporation on January 20, 1989 and August

                           ARTICLE FOUR

                          LIFE INSURANCE

    Section 4.1 Tandy may obtain permanent life insurance
    insuring the life of any Participant as a means of funding
    Tandy's obligations to his Beneficiary in whole or part. 
    Tandy shall be the sole owner and beneficiary of all such
    policies of insurance so obtained and of all incidents of
    ownership therein, including without limitation, the rights
    to all cash and loan values, dividends (if any), death
    benefits and the right to terminate.  No Beneficiary or
    Participant shall be entitled to any rights, interests or
    equities in such policies or to any specific asset of Tandy
    of any type, and on the contrary, their rights against Tandy
    under the Plan shall be solely as general creditors.

    Section 4.2 If as a result of misrepresentations made by a
    Participant in any application for life insurance upon his
    life obtained by Tandy hereunder, the insurance carrier or
    carriers or any reinsurance thereof successfully avoid(s)
    payment to Tandy of the proceeds of its or their policy or
    policies, or such proceeds are not payable because the
    Participant's death results from suicide within two (2) years
    of the issuance of such policy or within two (2) years of the
    issuance to Tandy of additional policies obtained by Tandy
    hereunder, then, in any of said events, notwithstanding any
    other provisions of the Plan or of the Plan Agreement with
    such Participant, Tandy shall have no obligation to his
    Beneficiary to provide any of the death benefits otherwise
    payable under the terms thereof.

    obtain such insurance coverage.  If a Participant refuses to
    cooperate in the securing of life insurance, or if Tandy is
    unable to secure life insurance at standard rates on a
    Participant, then the Plan Agreement shall be of no force and
    effect as to a Participant unless Tandy waives such
    requirement in writing.

    Section 4.4 All benefits under the Plan or Plan Agreement
    represent an unsecured promise to pay by Tandy Corporation. 
    The Plan shall be unfunded and the benefits hereunder shall
    be paid only from the general assets of Tandy Corporation
    resulting in the Participants having no greater rights than
    Tandy Corporation's general creditors; provided, however,
    nothing herein shall prevent or prohibit Tandy Corporation
    from establishing a trust or other arrangement for the
    purpose of providing for the payment of the benefits payable
    under the Plan or Plan Agreement.


                            ARTICLE FIVE

    upon the Retirement of a Participant, Tandy agrees to pay to
    Participant a Retirement benefit as follows:

         (a)  Normal Retirement.  If a Participant retires at the
    date of Normal Retirement, then Tandy agrees to pay to
    Participant or to the designated Beneficiary of Participant
    in the event of the death of Participant prior to the
    termination of payment of Retirement benefits hereunder, all
    from its general assets, an amount equal to such
    Participant's Plan Benefit Amount, such sum to be paid as set
    forth in Section 5.3 hereof.

         (b)  Late Retirement.  If a Participant retires at a
    date that constitutes Late Retirement, then Tandy agrees to
    pay to Participant or to the designated Beneficiary of
    Participant in the event of the death of Participant prior to
    the termination of payment of Late Retirement benefits
    hereunder, all from its general assets, an amount equal to
    such Participant's Plan Benefit Amount, reduced by a
    percentage determined as follows:

             Age on Date of             Percent of Reduction
            Late Retirement            of Plan Benefit Amount

                  66                               0%
                  67                               0%
                  68                               0%
                  69                               0%
                  70                               0%
                  71                              20%
                  72                              40%
                  73                              60%
                  74                              80%
                  75                             100%

    The percent of reduction of a Participant's Plan Benefit
    Amount shall be measured on a fiscal year beginning on the
    date of Participant's date of birth and shall commence on the
    day after the date a Participant attains age 70, and any
    reduction for a part of a year shall be prorated on a daily
    basis at the applicable percentage assuming a 365-day year. 
    Such amount shall be paid as set forth in Section 5.3 hereof.

    Section 5.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
    upon the death of a Participant, but only if the Participant
    is an Employee of Tandy at his death (except as set forth in
    Section 5.2(c) below) and is not being paid benefits pursuant
    to a Plan Agreement at such time, Tandy agrees to pay to his
    Beneficiary from its general assets an amount equal to such
    Participant's Plan Benefit Amount as reflected in Employee's
    Plan Agreement or, as the case may be, in the last amendment
    to his Plan Agreement.  With respect to such benefits,
    however, it is further provided that:

         (a)  no benefits shall be payable to the Beneficiary of
    a Participant in those instances covered by Section 4.2;

         (b)  if a Participant dies while an Employee of Tandy
    after the date of his Normal Retirement, then the amount
    payable to his Beneficiary upon a Participant's death shall
    be reduced as set forth in Section 5.1(b) hereof.

         (c)  The death of a Participant within the first year
    after involuntary termination of employment with Tandy as
    provided in Section 8.6 shall not defeat the right of such
    Participant's Beneficiary to receive benefits under this
    Section 5.2 so long as an event described in Section 8.5(a),
    (b) or (c) occurs within one year of the date of termination
    of the Participant's employment.

    Section 5.3 Except as provided in Section 8.5, the aggregate
    amount payable to a Participant or his Beneficiary upon (a)
    Normal Retirement, (b) Late Retirement, (c) benefits due and
    payable under Section 8.5 or 8.6 hereof, or (d) death of a
    Participant, shall be paid in one hundred twenty (120) equal
    monthly installments commencing on the first day of the month
    next following thirty (30) days after Retirement or after the
    Committee's receipt of a certified death or proof of death
    certificate verifying the Participant's death, or at the time
    stated in Section 8.5 or 8.6 hereof.  A Participant shall
    notify Tandy of Retirement by hand delivery or by certified
    or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage
    prepaid, of a written notice of Retirement specifying the
    effective date of Retirement, such written notice to be
    addressed to: Insurance Committee of the Board of Directors,
    Tandy Corporation, 1800 One Tandy Center, Fort Worth, Texas
    76102.  Such notice shall be deemed to be received when
    actually received by said Insurance Committee at said address
    as may be changed from time to time in the Plan Agreements,
    as amended.

    Section 5.4 Until actually paid and delivered to the
    Participant or to the Beneficiary entitled to same, none of
    the benefits payable by Tandy under any Plan Agreement shall
    be liable for the debts or liabilities of either the
    Participant or his Beneficiary, nor shall the same be subject
    to seizure by any creditor of the Participant or his
    Beneficiary under any writ or proceeding at law, in equity or
    in Bankruptcy.  Further, no Participant or Beneficiary shall
    have power to sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or in any
    manner anticipate or dispose of the benefits to which he is
    entitled or may become entitled under a Plan Agreement.

    Section 5.5

         (a)  During the period that Participant is receiving
    benefits under a Plan Agreement and for one (1) year after
    cessation of payment of benefits, Participant agrees that he
    will not, either directly or indirectly, within the United
    States of America or in any country of the world that Tandy
    (or a Tandy Subsidiary) or one of its dealers or franchisees
    sells Consumer Electronic Products (as hereinafter defined)
    at retail, own, manage, operate, join, control, be employed
    by, be a consultant to, be a partner in, be a creditor of,
    engage in joint operations with, be a stockholder, officer or
    director of any corporation, sole proprietorship or business
    entity of any type, or participate in the ownership,
    management, direction, or control or in any other manner be
    connected with, any business selling Consumer Electronic
    Products at retail which is at the time of Participant's
    engaging in such conduct competitive with such products sold
    by Tandy at retail, except as a stockholder owning less than
    five percent (5%) of the shares of a corporation whose shares
    are traded on a stock exchange or in the over-the-counter
    market by a member of the National Association of Securities
    Dealers.  "Consumer Electronic Products" are those type of
    products sold at the retail level to the ultimate customer as
    are advertised by Tandy in its most recently published annual
    catalogs and monthly flyers.  Manufacturing of Consumer
    Electronic Products and sale of Consumer Electronic Products
    at levels of distribution other than the retail level are not
    considered a violation of this covenant.

         (b)  In the event that a Participant engages in any of
    the activities described in Section 5.5(a) Tandy will give
    notice to the Participant specifying in detail the alleged
    violation of Section 5.5(a).  Participant will be allowed
    ninety (90) days to cure such default.  If the Committee
    feels there is continuing competition, then, without any
    further notice or opportunity to cure, and upon determination
    by the Board of Directors that such a Participant is engaged
    in such activities, such Board's decision to be conclusive
    and binding upon all concerned, and notwithstanding any other
    provisions of the Plan or of the Plan Agreement with such
    Participant, Tandy's obligation to a Participant to pay any
    benefits hereunder shall automatically cease and terminate
    and Tandy shall have no further obligation to such
    Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to the Plan or the Plan
    Agreement.  Tandy may also enforce this provision by suit for
    damages which shall include but not be limited to all sums
    paid to Participant hereunder, or for injunction, or both.

    Section 5.6 Tandy may liquidate out of the interest of a
    Participant hereunder, but only as Retirement or death
    benefits become due and payable hereunder, any outstanding
    loan or loans or other indebtedness of a Participant.  Tandy
    may elect not to distribute Retirement or death benefits to
    any Participant or to a Beneficiary unless and until all
    unpaid loans or other indebtedness due to Tandy from such
    Participant, together with interest, have been paid in full.

    Section 5.7 Subject to termination or amendment of the Plan,
    Plan Agreement, or both, a Participant's participation in the
    Plan shall continue during his Disability or his taking a
    Leave of Absence.  A Participant who is Disabled or on Leave
    of Absence shall notify Tandy of his date of Retirement as
    provided in Section 5.3 hereof.


                           ARTICLE SIX

                 AMENDMENTS OF PLAN AGREEMENTS

    Section 6.1 The Committee may enter into amendments to the
    Plan Agreement with any Participant for the purpose of
    increasing the benefits payable to the Participant or his
    Beneficiary in view of increases in his compensation
    following the execution of such Plan Agreement or the last
    amendment thereto and for the purpose of amending any
    provision of this Plan as it might apply to a Participant. 
    In such cases, the acceptance of an amendment by a
    Participant is voluntary and until the amended Plan Agreement
    has been submitted to and accepted by him, it shall not be
    effective.

                             ARTICLE SEVEN

                    BENEFICIARIES OF PARTICIPANTS

    Section 7.1 At the time of his acceptance of a Plan
    Agreement, a Participant shall be required to designate the
    Beneficiary to whom benefits under the Plan and his Plan
    Agreement will be payable upon his death.  A Beneficiary may
    be one (1) or more persons or entities, such as dependents,
    persons who are natural objects of the Participant's bounty,
    an inter vivos or testamentary trust, or his estate.  Such
    Beneficiaries may be designated contingently or successively
    as the Participant may direct.  The designation of his
    Beneficiary shall be made by the Participant on a Beneficiary
    Designation Form to be furnished by the Committee and filed
    with it.

    Section 7.2 A Participant may change his Beneficiary, as he
    may desire, by filing new and amendatory Beneficiary
    Designation Forms with the Committee.

    Section 7.3 In the event a Participant designates more than
    one (1) Beneficiary to receive benefit payments
    simultaneously, each such Beneficiary shall be paid such
    proportion of such benefits as the Participant shall have
    designated.  If no such percentage designation has been made,
    the Committee shall hold all benefit payments until the
    Beneficiaries agree as to the distribution of the funds or a
    judicial determination has been made.

    Section 7.4 If the designated Beneficiary dies before the
    Participant in question and no Beneficiary was successively
    named, or if the designated Beneficiary dies before complete
    payment of the deceased Participant's benefits have been made
    and no Beneficiary was successively named, the Committee
    shall direct that such benefits (or the balance thereof) be
    paid to those persons who are the deceased Participant's
    heirs-at-law determined in accordance with the laws of
    descent and distribution in force at the date hereof in the
    State of Texas for separate personal property, such
    determination to be made as though the Participant had died
    intestate and domiciled in Texas.

    Section 7.5 Whenever any person entitled to payments under
    this Plan shall be a minor or under other legal disability or
    in the sole judgment of the Committee shall otherwise be
    unable to apply such payments to his own best interest and
    advantage (as in the case of illness, whether mental or
    physical, or where the person not under legal disability is
    unable to preserve his estate for his own best interest), the
    Committee may in the exercise of its discretion direct all or
    any portion of such payments to be made in any one or more of
    the following ways unless claims shall have been made
    therefor by an existing and duly appointed guardian,
    conservator, committee or other duly appointed legal
    representative, in which event payment shall be made to such
    representative:

         (1)  directly to such person unless such person shall be
    an infant or shall have been legally adjudicated incompetent
    at the time of the payment;

         (2)  to the spouse, child, parent or other blood
    relative to be expended on behalf of the person entitled or
    on behalf of those dependents as to whom the person entitled
    has the duty of support;

         (3)  to a recognized charity or governmental institution
    to be expended for the benefit of the person entitled or for
    the benefit of those dependents as to whom the person
    entitled has the duty of support; or

         (4)  to any other institution, approved by the
    Committee, to be expended for the benefit of the person
    entitled or for the benefit of those dependents as to whom
    the person entitled has the duty of support.

    The decision of the Committee will, in each case, be final
    and binding upon all persons and the Committee shall not be
    obligated to see to the proper application or expenditure of
    any payments so made.  Any payment made pursuant to the power
    herein conferred upon the Committee shall operate as a
    complete discharge of the obligations of Tandy and of the
    Committee.

    Section 7.6 If the Committee has any doubt as to the proper
    Beneficiary to receive payments hereunder, the Committee
    shall have the right to withhold such payments until the
    matter is finally adjudicated or the Committee may direct
    Tandy to bring a suit for interpleader in any appropriate
    court, pay any amounts due into the court, and Tandy shall
    have the right to recover its reasonable attorney's fees from
    such proceeds so paid or to be paid.  Any payment made by the
    Committee, in good faith and in accordance with this Plan,
    shall fully discharge the Committee and Tandy from all
    further obligations with respect to such payments.


                           ARTICLE EIGHT

                   TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION

    Section 8.1 Except as provided in Sections 8.4, 8.5, 8.6,
    10.1, and 10.2 hereof, termination of a Participant's
    employment by Tandy other than by reason of Retirement,
    Disability or Leave of Absence, whether by action of Tandy or
    the Participant's resignation, shall terminate the
    Participant's participation in the Plan.  Neither the Plan
    nor the Plan Agreement shall in any way obligate Tandy to
    continue the employment of a Participant, nor will either
    limit the right of Tandy to terminate a Participant's
    employment at any time, for any reason, with or without
    cause.

    Section 8.2 Except as provided in Sections 8.4, 8.5, 8.6,
    10.1 and 10.2 hereof, participation in the Plan by a
    Participant shall also terminate if the Plan or his Plan
    Agreement is terminated by Tandy in accordance with Article
    Ten.

    Section 8.3 Except as provided in Sections 8.4, 8.5, 8.6,
    10.1, and 10.2 hereof, upon termination of a Participant's
    participation in the Plan, all of Tandy's obligations to the
    Participant and his Beneficiary under the Plan and Plan
    Agreement and each of them, shall terminate and be of no
    further effect.

    Section 8.4 Except as provided in Sections 8.5, 8.6, 10.1 and
    10.2, if a Participant's participation in the Plan is
    terminated, by:

         (a)  termination of the Plan;

         (b)  termination of a Plan Agreement; or

         (c)  termination of employment for any reasons other than

              (i)  death or Retirement, which shall be governed
    by Article Five, or

              (ii)  dishonest or fraudulent conduct of a
    Participant or indictment of a Participant for a felony crime
    involving moral turpitude, in which event no vesting under
    Section 8.4, 8.6, 10.1, or 10.2 shall occur,

    then such Participant shall be entitled, as set forth below,
    to a percentage of his Plan Benefit Amount as follows:

      Age Attained at Date of Event Set
      Forth in Section 8.4(a), (b) or (c)         % Vested

          Any age under 65 years                       0%

          Age 65 to age 70                           100%

          Age 70 to age 75                A percent as determined
                                              in 5.1(b) hereto

          Age 75 and thereafter                        0%

         The amount payable under this Section 8.4 shall be
    determined as of the date of the event set forth in Section
    8.4(a), (b) or (c) hereof and such amount as so determined at
    that time shall not be altered or changed thereafter except
    that the provisions of Section 5.5 hereof shall remain fully
    applicable during the Participant's employment by Tandy,
    during the payment of benefits under this Section 8.4 and for
    one (1) year after termination of employment or payment of
    benefits.  The amount payable under this Section 8.4 shall be
    paid as set forth in Section 5.3 hereunder to commence on the
    first day of the month next following thirty (30) days after
    cessation of Participant's employment with Tandy.

    Section 8.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
    Plan,

         (a)  In the event of a "Change in Control" (as
    hereinafter defined), every Participant immediately shall be
    vested with his Plan Benefit Amount, notwithstanding the
    Participant's age, provided, however, any Participant who has
    at the time of a Change in Control over the age of 70 years
    shall suffer a reduction of his Plan Benefit Amount as set
    forth in Section 5.1(b).  Such retirement benefit shall be
    payable in a lump sum on the first day of the month next
    following the date on which such Participant's employment
    with Tandy Corporation terminates for any reason (the
    "Termination Date").  Such lump sum payment shall equal the
    present value of the Participant's Plan Benefit Amount
    discounted for interest only at the Pension Benefit Guaranty
    Corporation's Immediate Annuity Rate used to value benefits
    for single-employer plans terminating on the Termination
    Date, compounded semi-annually.

         (b)  Any Participant or Beneficiary who on the date of a
    Change in Control was receiving benefits under the Plan shall
    be entitled to receive a lump sum equal to the present value
    of the remaining Plan Benefit Amount, payable on the first
    day of the month next following the date of the Change in
    Control, calculated in a manner consistent with Section
    8.5(a).

    Section 8.6 In the event that a Participant's employment with
    Tandy Corporation is involuntarily terminated for any reason
    other than those reasons set forth in Section 8.4(c)(ii), and
    within a one-year period beginning on the date of such
    termination there occurs a Change in Control, then such
    Participant, or his Beneficiary if such Participant dies
    after termination of employment, shall be entitled to receive
    a lump sum equal to the present value of the Participant's
    Plan Benefit Amount (determined in a manner consistent with
    Section 8.5(a)), payable in a lump sum on the first day of
    the month next following the date of the Change in Control.

    Section 8.7 For purposes of the Program, "Change in Control"
    shall mean any of the following events:

         (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from Tandy
    Corporation) of any voting securities of Tandy Corporation
    (the "Voting Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person
    is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"))
    immediately after which such Person has "Beneficial
    Ownership" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
    under the 1934 Act) of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
    combined voting power of Tandy Corporation's then outstanding
    Voting Securities; provided, however, in determining whether
    a Change in Control has occurred, Voting Securities which are
    acquired in a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter
    defined) shall not constitute an acquisition which would
    cause a Change in Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall
    mean an acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a
    trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (a) Tandy
    Corporation or (b) any corporation or other Person of which a
    majority of its voting power or its voting equity securities
    or equity interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by Tandy
    Corporation (for purposes of this Section 8.7, a "Tandy
    Subsidiary"), (2) Tandy Corporation or its Tandy
    Subsidiaries, or (3) any Person in connection with a
    "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter defined).

         (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990, are
    members of the board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any
    reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the Board;
    provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for
    election by Tandy Corporation's stockholders, of any new
    director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
    Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of the
    Plan, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board;
    provided further, however, that no individual shall be
    considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
    initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or
    threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11
    promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

         (c)  Approval by stockholders of Tandy Corporation of:

              (1)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization
    involving Tandy Corporation, unless

                   (i)  the stockholders of Tandy Corporation,
    immediately before such merger, consolidation or
    reorganization, own, directly or indirectly immediately
    following such merger, consolidation or reorganization, at
    least sixty percent (60%) of the combined voting power of the
    outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting
    from such merger or consolidation or reorganization (the
    "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the same proportion
    as their ownership of the Voting Securities immediately
    before such merger, consolidation or reorganization,

                   (ii)  the individuals who were members of the
    Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the
    agreement providing for such merger, consolidation or
    reorganization constitute at least two-thirds of the members
    of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation,

                   (iii)  no Person (other than Tandy
    Corporation, any Tandy Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan
    (or any trust forming part thereof) maintained by Tandy
    Corporation, the Surviving Corporation, or any Tandy
    Subsidiary, or any Person who, immediately prior to such
    merger, consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial
    Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the then
    outstanding Voting Securities) has Beneficial Ownership of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the combined voting power of the Surviving Corporation's then
    outstanding voting securities, and

                   (iv)  a transaction described in clauses (i)
    through (iii) shall herein be referred to as a "Non-Control
    Transaction";

              (2)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of Tandy
    Corporation; or

              (3)  An agreement for the sale or other disposition
    of all or substantially all of the assets of Tandy
    Corporation to any Person (other than a transfer to a Tandy
    Subsidiary).

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall
    not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the
    "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than
    the permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as
    a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by Tandy
    Corporation which, by reducing the number of Voting
    Securities outstanding, increases the proportional number of
    shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided
    that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the
    operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of
    Voting Securities by Tandy Corporation, and after such share
    acquisition by Tandy Corporation, the Subject Person becomes
    the Beneficial Owner of any additional Voting Securities
    which increases the percentage of the then outstanding Voting
    Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a
    Change in Control shall occur.

    Section 8.8 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
    the Plan, upon a Change in Control, the provisions of
    Sections 5.5 and 5.6 shall lapse and become null and void.


                             ARTICLE NINE

                     ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

    Section 9.1 The Plan shall be administered by the Insurance
    Committee of the Board of Directors of Tandy, as it is
    presently constituted or as it may be changed from time to
    time by the Board of Directors of Tandy.

    Section 9.2 In addition to the express powers and authorities
    accorded the Committee under the Plan, it shall be
    responsible for:

         (a)  construing and interpreting the Plan;

         (b)  computing and certifying to Tandy the amount of
    benefits to be provided in each Plan Agreement for the
    Participant or the Beneficiary of the Participant; and

         (c)  determining the right of a Participant or a
    Beneficiary to payments under the Plan and otherwise
    authorizing disbursements of such payments by Tandy;

    in these and all other respects its decisions shall be
    conclusive and binding upon all concerned.

    Section 9.3 Tandy agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the
    members of the Committee against any and all expenses, claims
    and causes of action by or on behalf of any and all parties
    whomsoever, and all losses therefrom, including without
    limitation the cost of defense and attorney's fees, based
    upon or arising out of any act or omission relating to or in
    connection with the Plan other than losses resulting from any
    such Committee member's fraud or willful misconduct.


                               ARTICLE TEN

                   TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN
                            OR PLAN AGREEMENTS

    Section 10.1 Tandy reserves the right to terminate or amend
    this Plan or any Plan Agreement, in whole or in part, at any
    time, from time to time, by resolution of the Board of
    Directors of Tandy, provided, however, no amendment to the
    Plan or to any Plan Agreement shall alter the vested rights
    of a Participant or Beneficiary applicable on the effective
    date of such termination or amendment and, except for
    increases in Plan Compensation as provided in Section 8.5
    hereof, such vested rights shall remain unchanged.  Rights
    are deemed to have vested if benefits are actually being paid
    or if the only condition precedent to the payment of benefits
    is the termination of employment (unless terminated for
    reasons set forth in Section 8.4(c)(ii), in which event
    benefits are forfeited) with Tandy or the giving of notice of
    Retirement or the occurrence of an event described in Section
    8.5(a) or (b).

    Section 10.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
    Plan,

         (a)  Sections 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8 and this Section 10.2
    shall not be amended or terminated at any time.

         (b)  For a period of one (1) year following a Change in
    Control, the Plan or Plan Agreement shall not be terminated
    or amended in any way, nor shall the manner in which the Plan
    is administered be changed in a way that adversely affects
    the Participants' right to existing or future Tandy
    Corporation provided benefits or contributions provided
    hereunder, including, but not limited to, any change in, or
    to, the eligibility requirements, benefit formulae and manner
    and optional forms of payments.

         (c)  Any amendment or termination of the Plan prior to a
    Change in Control which (i) was at the request of a third
    party who has indicated an intention or taken steps
    reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or (ii)
    otherwise arose in connection with, or in anticipation of, a
    Change in Control, shall be null and void and shall have no
    effect whatsoever.

         (d)  In the event the Plan or any Plan Agreement is
    terminated or adversely amended to the detriment of any
    Participant and within a one-year period from the effective
    date of any such amendment or termination a Change in Control
    occurs, then any Participant so affected whose employment
    with Tandy Corporation is terminated, voluntarily or
    involuntarily, within a three-year period from the date of
    the Change in Control shall be entitled to receive those
    benefits set forth in Section 8.5 hereof to the same extent
    and in the same amounts as though such amendment or
    termination had not occurred.  This Section 10.2(d) shall not
    apply to any Participant who, on the date of the Change in
    Control, has previously retired or has otherwise voluntarily
    terminated his employment with Tandy Corporation.


                           ARTICLE ELEVEN

                            MISCELLANEOUS

    Section 11.1 The Plan and Plan Agreement and each of their
    provisions shall be construed and their validity determined
    under the laws of the State of Texas.

    Section 11.2 The masculine gender, where appearing in the
    Plan or Plan Agreement, shall be deemed to include the
    feminine gender.  The words "herein", "hereunder" and other
    similar compounds of the word "here" shall mean and refer to
    the entire Plan and Plan Agreement, not to any particular
    provision, section or subsection, and words used in the
    singular or plural may be construed as though in the plural
    or singular where they would so apply.

    Section 11.3 Any action brought by a Participant under the
    Plan or Plan Agreement may be brought in the appropriate
    state or federal court for Tarrant County, Texas, or for the
    county wherein the Participant maintains his or her
    residence.  Any suit brought by Tandy Corporation under the
    Plan may only be brought in the county wherein the
    Participant maintains his or her residence, unless the
    Participant consents to suit elsewhere.

    Section 11.4 Any person born on February 29 shall be deemed
    to have been born on the immediately preceding February 28
    for all purposes of this Plan.

    Section 11.5 This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the
    benefit of any successor of Tandy and any such successor
    shall be deemed substituted for Tandy under the terms of this
    Plan.  As used in this Plan, the term "successor" shall
    include any person, firm, corporation, or other business
    entity which at any time, whether by merger, purchase, or
    otherwise, acquires all or substantially all of the assets or
    business of Tandy.

    Section 11.6 A Participant shall not be required to mitigate
    the amount of any payment provided for in this Plan by
    seeking other employment or otherwise.

    Section 11.7 In the event that a Participant institutes any
    legal action to enforce his rights under, or to recover
    damages for breach of any of the terms of this Plan or any
    Plan Agreement, the Participant, if he is the prevailing
    party, shall be entitled to recover from Tandy all actual
    expenses incurred in the prosecution of said suit including
    but not limited to attorneys' fees, court costs, and all
    other actual expenses.

    Section 11.8 Notwithstanding all other provisions in the
    Plan, in the event a Participant is entitled to benefits
    under two (2) separate sections of the Plan, the maximum a
    Participant may receive under this Plan is his Plan Benefit
    Amount, payable in accordance with Section 5.3 hereof.

               SPECIAL COMPENSATION PLAN NO. 2 FOR
               TANDY CORPORATION EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 


                           ARTICLE ONE

                             PURPOSE

    Section 1.1 The purpose of this Tandy Corporation Officers
    Special Deferred Compensation Plan No.  2 ("the Plan") is to
    enable Tandy Corporation and its subsidiaries to secure and

                          LIFE INSURANCE

    Section 4.1 Tandy may obtain permanent life insurance
    insuring the life of any Participant as a means of funding
    Tandy's obligations to his Beneficiary in whole or part. 
    Tandy shall be the sole owner and beneficiary of all such
    policies of insurance so obtained and of all incidents of
    ownership therein, including without limitation, the rights
    to all cash and loan values, dividends (if any), death
    benefits and the right to terminate.  No Beneficiary or
    Participant shall be entitled to any rights, interests or
    equities in such policies or to any specific asset of Tandy
    of any type, and on the contrary, their rights against Tandy
    under the Plan shall be solely as general creditors.

    Section 4.2 If as a result of misrepresentations made by a
    Participant in any application for life insurance upon his
    life obtained by Tandy hereunder, the insurance carrier or
    carriers or any reinsurance thereof successfully avoid(s)
    payment to Tandy of the proceeds of its or their policy or
    policies, or such proceeds are not payable because the
    Participant's death results from suicide within two (2) years
    of the issuance of such policy or within two (2) years of the
    issuance to Tandy of additional policies obtained by Tandy
    hereunder, then, in any of said events, notwithstanding any

    obtain such insurance coverage.  If a Participant refuses to
    cooperate in the securing of life insurance, or if Tandy is

    Participant, then the Plan Agreement shall be of no force and
    effect as to a Participant unless Tandy waives such
    requirement in writing.

    represent an unsecured promise to pay by Tandy Corporation.

    from establishing a trust or other arrangement for the
    purpose of providing for the payment of the benefits payable
    under the Plan or Plan Agreement.

    sixty (60).  Any reduction for a part of a year shall be
    prorated on a daily basis assuming a 365-day year.  Such
    amount shall be paid as set forth in Section 5.3 hereof.

         (c)  Late Retirement.  If a Participant retires at a

                66                                 0%
                67                                 0%
                68                                 0%
                69                                 0%

                71                                20%
                72                                40%

                75                               100%

    The percent of reduction of a Participant's Plan Benefit
    Amount shall be measured on a fiscal year beginning on the
    date of Participant's date of birth and shall commence on the
    day after the date a Participant attains age 70, and any
    reduction for a part of a year shall be prorated on a daily
    basis at the applicable percentage assuming a 365-day year. 
    Such amount shall be paid as set forth in Section 5.3 hereof.

    Section 5.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
    upon the death of a Participant, but only if the Participant
    is an Employee of Tandy at his death (except as set forth in
    Section 5.2(c) below) and is not being paid benefits pursuant
    to a Plan Agreement at such time, Tandy agrees to pay to his
    Beneficiary from its general assets an amount equal to such
    Participant's Plan Benefit Amount as reflected in Employee's
    Plan Agreement or, as the case may be, in the last amendment
    to his Plan Agreement.  With respect to such benefits,
    however, it is further provided that:

         (a)  no benefits shall be payable to the Beneficiary of
    a Participant in those instances covered by Section 4.2;

         (b)  if a Participant dies while an Employee of Tandy
    after the date of his Normal Retirement, then the amount
    payable to his Beneficiary upon a Participant's death shall
    be reduced as set forth in Section 5.1(c) hereof.

         (c)  The death of a Participant within the first year
    after involuntary termination of employment with Tandy as
    provided in Section 8.6 shall not defeat the right of such
    Participant's Beneficiary to receive benefits under this
    Section 5.2 so long as an event described in Section 8.5(a),
    (b) or (c) occurs within one year of the date of termination
    of the Participant's employment.

    Section 5.3 Except as provided in Section 8.5, the aggregate
    amount payable upon the Normal Retirement, Early Retirement,
    Late Retirement benefits due and payable under Section 8.5 or
    8.6 hereof, or death of a Participant to a Participant or his
    Beneficiary shall be paid in one hundred twenty (120) equal
    monthly installments commencing on the first day of the month
    next following thirty (30) days after Retirement or after the
    Committee's receipt of a certified death or proof of death
    certificate verifying the Participant's death, or at the time
    stated in Section 8.5 or 8.6 hereof.  A Participant shall
    notify Tandy of Retirement by hand delivery or by certified
    or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage
    prepaid, of a written notice of Retirement specifying the
    effective date of Retirement, such written notice to be
    addressed to: Insurance Committee of the Board of Directors,
    Tandy Corporation, 1800 One Tandy Center, Fort Worth, Texas
    76102.  Such notice shall be deemed to be received when
    actually received by said Insurance Committee at said address
    as may be changed from time to time in the Plan Agreements,
    as amended.

    Section 5.4 Until actually paid and delivered to the
    Participant or to the Beneficiary entitled to same, none of
    the benefits payable by Tandy under any Plan Agreement shall
    be liable for the debts or liabilities of either the
    Participant or his Beneficiary, nor shall the same be subject
    to seizure by any creditor of the Participant or his
    Beneficiary under any writ or proceeding at law, in equity or
    in Bankruptcy.  Further, no Participant or Beneficiary shall
    have power to sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or in any
    manner anticipate or dispose of the benefits to which he is
    entitled or may become entitled under a Plan Agreement.

    Section 5.5

         (a)  During the period that Participant is receiving
    benefits under a Plan Agreement and for one (1) year after
    cessation of payment of benefits, Participant agrees that he
    will not, either directly or indirectly, within the United
    States of America or in any country of the world that Tandy
    (or a Tandy Subsidiary) or one of its dealers or franchisees
    sells Consumer Electronic Products (as hereinafter defined)
    at retail, own, manage, operate, join, control, be employed
    by, be a consultant to, be a partner in, be a creditor of,
    engage in joint operations with, be a stockholder, officer or
    director of any corporation, sole proprietorship or business
    entity of any type, or participate in the ownership,
    management, direction, or control or in any other manner be
    connected with, any business selling Consumer Electronic
    Products at retail which is at the time of Participant's
    engaging in such conduct competitive with such products sold
    by Tandy at retail, except as a stockholder owning less than
    five percent (5%) of the shares of a corporation whose shares
    are traded on a stock exchange or in the over-the-counter
    market by a member of the National Association of Securities
    Dealers.  "Consumer Electronic Products" are those type of
    products sold at the retail level to the ultimate customer as
    are advertised by Tandy in its most recently published annual
    catalogs and monthly flyers.  Manufacturing of Consumer
    Electronic Products and sale of Consumer Electronic Products
    at levels of distribution other than the retail level are not
    considered a violation of this covenant.

         (b)  In the event that a Participant engages in any of
    the activities described in Section 5.5(a) Tandy will give
    notice to the Participant specifying in detail the alleged
    violation of Section 5.5(a).  Participant will be allowed
    ninety (90) days to cure such default.  If the Committee
    feels there is continuing competition, then, without any
    further notice or opportunity to cure, and upon determination
    by the Board of Directors that such a Participant is engaged
    in such activities, such Board's decision to be conclusive
    and binding upon all concerned, and notwithstanding any other
    provisions of the Plan or of the Plan Agreement with such
    Participant, Tandy's obligation to a Participant to pay any
    benefits hereunder shall automatically cease and terminate
    and Tandy shall have no further obligation to such
    Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to the Plan or the Plan
    Agreement.  Tandy may also enforce this provision by suit for
    damages which shall include but not be limited to all sums
    paid to Participant hereunder, or for injunction, or both.

    Section 5.6 Tandy may liquidate out of the interest of a
    Participant hereunder, but only as Retirement or death
    benefits become due and payable hereunder, any outstanding
    loan or loans or other indebtedness of a Participant.  Tandy
    may elect not to distribute Retirement or death benefits to
    any Participant or to a Beneficiary unless and until all
    unpaid loans or other indebtedness due to Tandy from such
    Participant, together with interest, have been paid in full.

    Section 5.7 Subject to termination or amendment of the Plan,
    Plan Agreement, or both, a Participant's participation in the
    Plan shall continue during his Disability or his taking a
    Leave of Absence.  A Participant who is Disabled or on Leave
    of Absence shall notify Tandy of his date of Retirement as
    provided in Section 5.3 hereof.

                          ARTICLE SIX

                 AMENDMENTS OF PLAN AGREEMENTS

    Section 6.1 The Committee may enter into amendments to the
    Plan Agreement with any Participant for the purpose of
    increasing the benefits payable to the Participant or his
    Beneficiary in view of increases in his compensation
    following the execution of such Plan Agreement or the last
    amendment thereto and for the purpose of amending any
    provision of this Plan as it might apply to a Participant. 
    In such cases, the acceptance of an amendment by a
    Participant is voluntary and until the amended Plan Agreement
    has been submitted to and accepted by him, it shall not be
    effective.


                           ARTICLE SEVEN

                  BENEFICIARIES OF PARTICIPANTS

    Section 7.1 At the time of his acceptance of a Plan
    Agreement, a Participant shall be required to designate the
    Beneficiary to whom benefits under the Plan and his Plan
    Agreement will be payable upon his death.  A Beneficiary may
    be one (1) or more persons or entities, such as dependents,
    persons who are natural objects of the Participant's bounty,
    an inter vivos or testamentary trust, or his estate.  Such
    Beneficiaries may be designated contingently or successively
    as the Participant may direct.  The designation of his
    Beneficiary shall be made by the Participant on a Beneficiary
    Designation Form to be furnished by the Committee and filed
    with it.

    Section 7.2 A Participant may change his Beneficiary, as he
    may desire, by filing new and amendatory Beneficiary
    Designation Forms with the Committee.

    Section 7.3 In the event a Participant designates more than
    one (1) Beneficiary to receive benefit payments
    simultaneously, each such Beneficiary shall be paid such
    proportion of such benefits as the Participant shall have
    designated.  If no such percentage designation has been made,
    the Committee shall hold all benefit payments until the
    Beneficiaries agree as to the distribution of the funds or a
    judicial determination has been made.

    Section 7.4 If the designated Beneficiary dies before the
    Participant in question and no Beneficiary was successively
    named, or if the designated Beneficiary dies before complete
    payment of the deceased Participant's benefits have been made
    and no Beneficiary was successively named, the Committee
    shall direct that such benefits (or the balance thereof) be
    paid to those persons who are the deceased Participant's
    heirs-at-law determined in accordance with the laws of
    descent and distribution in force at the date hereof in the
    State of Texas for separate personal property, such
    determination to be made as though the Participant had died
    intestate and domiciled in Texas.

    Section 7.5 Whenever any person entitled to payments under
    this Plan shall be a minor or under other legal disability or
    in the sole judgment of the Committee shall otherwise be
    unable to apply such payments to his own best interest and
    advantage (as in the case of illness, whether mental or
    physical, or where the person not under legal disability is
    unable to preserve his estate for his own best interest), the
    Committee may in the exercise of its discretion direct all or
    any portion of such payments to be made in any one or more of
    the following ways unless claims shall have been made
    therefor by an existing and duly appointed guardian,
    conservator, committee or other duly appointed legal
    representative, in which event payment shall be made to such
    representative:

         (1)  directly to such person unless such person shall be
    an infant or shall have been legally adjudicated incompetent
    at the time of the payment;

         (2)  to the spouse, child, parent or other blood
    relative to be expended on behalf of the person entitled or
    on behalf of those dependents as to whom the person entitled
    has the duty of support;

         (3)  to a recognized charity or governmental institution
    to be expended for the benefit of the person entitled or for
    the benefit of those dependents as to whom the personen
    titled has the duty of support; or

         (4)  to any other institution, approved by the
    Committee, to be expended for the benefit of the person
    entitled or for the benefit of those dependents as to whom
    the person entitled has the duty of support.

    The decision of the Committee will, in each case, be final
    and binding upon all persons and the Committee shall not be
    obligated to see to the proper application or expenditure of
    any payments so made.  Any payment made pursuant to the power
    herein conferred upon the Committee shall operate as a
    complete discharge of the obligations of Tandy and of the
    Committee.

    Section 7.6 If the Committee has any doubt as to the proper
    Beneficiary to receive payments hereunder, the Committee
    shall have the right to withhold such payments until the
    matter is finally adjudicated or the Committee may direct
    Tandy to bring a suit for interpleader in any appropriate
    court, pay any amounts due into the court, and Tandy shall
    have the right to recover its reasonable attorney's fees from
    such proceeds so paid or to be paid.  Any payment made by the
    Committee, in good faith and in accordance with this Plan,
    shall fully discharge the Committee and Tandy from all
    further obligations with respect to such payments.

         The amount payable under this Section 8.4 shall be
    determined as of the date of the event set forth in Section
    8.4(a), (b) or (c) hereof and such amount as so determined at
    that time shall not be altered or changed thereafter except
    that the provisions of Section 5.5 hereof shall remain fully
    applicable during the Participant's employment by Tandy,
    during the payment of benefits under this Section 8.4 and for
    one (1) year after termination of employment or payment of
    benefits.  The amount payable under this Section 8.4 shall be
    paid as set forth in Section 5.3 hereunder to commence on the
    first day of the month next following thirty (30) days after
    cessation of Participant's employment with Tandy.

    Section 8.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
    Plan,

         (a)  In the event of a "Change in Control" (as
    hereinafter defined), every Participant immediately shall be
    vested with his Plan Benefit Amount determined without regard
    to Section 5.1(b) but subject to Section 5.1(c).  Such
    retirement benefit shall be payable in a lump sum on the
    first day of the month next following the date on which such
    Participant's employment with Tandy Corporation terminates
    for any reason (the "Termination Date").  Such lump sum
    payment shall equal the present value of the Participant's
    Plan Benefit Amount discounted for interest only at the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's Immediate Annuity Rate
    used to value benefits for single-employer plans terminating
    on the Termination Date, compounded semi-annually.

         (b)  Any Participant or Beneficiary who on the date of a
    Change in Control was receiving benefits under the Plan shall
    be entitled to receive a lump sum equal to the present value
    of the remaining Plan Benefit Amount, payable on the first
    day of the month next following the date of the Change in
    Control, calculated in a manner consistent with Section
    8.5(a).

    Section 8.6 In the event that a Participant's employment with
    Tandy Corporation is involuntarily terminated for any reason
    other than those reasons set forth in Section 8.4(c)(ii), and
    within a one-year period beginning on the date of such
    termination there occurs a Change in Control, then such
    Participant, or his Beneficiary if such Participant dies
    after termination of employment, shall be entitled to receive
    a lump sum equal to the present value of the Participant's
    Plan Benefit Amount (determined in a manner consistent with
    Section 8.5(a)), payable in a lump sum on the first day of
    the month next following the date of the Change in Control.

    Section 8.7 For purposes of the Program, "Change in Control"
    shall mean any of the following events:

         (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from Tandy
    Corporation) of any voting securities of Tandy Corporation
    (the "Voting Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person
    is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"))
    immediately after which such Person has "Beneficial
    Ownership" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
    under the 1934 Act) of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
    combined voting power of Tandy Corporation's then outstanding
    Voting Securities; provided, however, in determining whether
    a Change in Control has occurred, Voting Securities which are
    acquired in a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter
    defined) shall not constitute an acquisition which would
    cause a Change in Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall
    mean an acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a
    trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (a) Tandy
    Corporation or (b) any corporation or other Person of which a
    majority of its voting power or its voting equity securities
    or equity interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by Tandy
    Corporation (for purposes of this Section 8.7, a "Tandy
    Subsidiary"), (2) Tandy Corporation or its Tandy
    Subsidiaries, or (3) any Person in connection with a
    "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter defined).

         (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990, are
    members of the board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any
    reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the Board;
    provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for
    election by Tandy Corporation's stockholders, of any new
    director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
    Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of the
    Plan, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board;
    provided further, however, that no individual shall be
    considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
    initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or
    threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11
    promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

         (c)  Approval by stockholders of Tandy Corporation of:

              (1) A merger, consolidation or reorganization
    involving Tandy Corporation, unless

                   (i)  the stockholders of Tandy Corporation,
    immediately before such merger, consolidation or
    reorganization, own, directly or indirectly immediately
    following such merger, consolidation or reorganization, at
    least sixty percent (60%) of the combined voting power of the
    outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting
    from such merger or consolidation or reorganization (the
    "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the same proportion
    as their ownership of the Voting Securities immediately
    before such merger, consolidation or reorganization,

                   (ii)  the individuals who were members of the
    Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the
    agreement providing for such merger, consolidation or
    reorganization constitute at least two-thirds of the members
    of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation,

                   (iii)  no Person (other than Tandy
    Corporation, any Tandy Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan
    (or any trust forming part thereof) maintained by Tandy
    Corporation, the Surviving Corporation, or any Tandy
    Subsidiary, or any Person who, immediately prior to such
    merger, consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial
    Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the then
    outstanding Voting Securities) has Beneficial Ownership of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the combined voting power of the Surviving Corporation's then
    outstanding voting securities, and

                   (iv)  a transaction described in clauses (i)
    through (iii) shall herein be referred to as a "Non-Control
    Transaction";

              (2)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of Tandy
    Corporation; or

              (3)  An agreement for the sale or other disposition
    of all or substantially all of the assets of Tandy
    Corporation to any Person (other than a transfer to a Tandy
    Subsidiary).

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall
    not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the
    "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than
    the permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as
    a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by Tandy
    Corporation which, by reducing the number of Voting
    Securities outstanding, increases the proportional number of
    shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided
    that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the
    operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of
    Voting Securities by Tandy Corporation, and after such share
    acquisition by Tandy Corporation, the Subject Person becomes
    the Beneficial Owner of any additional Voting Securities
    which increases the percentage of the then outstanding Voting
    Securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a
    Change in Control shall occur.

    Section 8.8 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in
    the Plan, upon a Change in Control, the provisions of
    Sections 5.5 and 5.6 shall lapse and become null and void.


                             ARTICLE NINE

                      ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

    Section 9.1 The Plan shall be administered by the Insurance
    Committee of the Board of Directors of Tandy, as it is
    presently constituted or as it may be changed from time to
    time by the Board of Directors of Tandy.

    Section 9.2 In addition to the express powers and authorities
    accorded the Committee under the Plan, it shall be
    responsible for:

         (a)  construing and interpreting the Plan;

         (b)  computing and certifying to Tandy the amount of
    benefits to be provided in each Plan Agreement for the
    Participant or the Beneficiary of the Participant; and

         (c)  determining the right of a Participant or a
    Beneficiary to payments under the Plan and otherwise
    authorizing disbursements of such payments by Tandy;

    in these and all other respects its decisions shall be
    conclusive and binding upon all concerned.

    Section 9.3 Tandy agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the
    members of the Committee against any and all expenses, claims
    and causes of action by or on behalf of any and all parties
    whomsoever, and all losses therefrom, including without
    limitation the cost of defense and attorney's fees, based
    upon or arising out of any act or omission relating to or in
    connection with the Plan other than losses resulting from any
    such Committee member's fraud or willful misconduct.


                               ARTICLE TEN

                   TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN
                            OR PLAN AGREEMENTS

    Section 10.1 Tandy reserves the right to terminate or amend
    this Plan or any Plan Agreement, in whole or in part, at any
    time, from time to time, by resolution of the Board of
    Directors of Tandy, provided, however, no amendment to the
    Plan or to any Plan Agreement shall alter the vested rights
    of a Participant or Beneficiary applicable on the effective
    date of such termination or amendment and, except for
    increases in Plan Compensation as provided in Section 8.5
    hereof, such vested rights shall remain unchanged.  Rights
    are deemed to have vested if benefits are actually being paid
    or if the only condition precedent to the payment of benefits
    is the termination of employment (unless terminated for
    reasons set forth in Section 8.4(c)(ii), in which event
    benefits are forfeited) with Tandy or the giving of notice of
    Retirement or the occurrence of an event described in Section
    8.5(a) or (b).

    Section 10.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan,

         (a)  Sections 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8 and this Section 10.2
    shall not be amended or terminated at any time.

         (b)  For a period of one (1) year following a Change in
    Control, the Plan or Plan Agreement shall not be terminated
    or amended in any way, nor shall the manner in which the Plan
    is administered be changed in a way that adversely affects
    the Participants' right to existing or future Tandy
    Corporation provided benefits or contributions provided
    hereunder, including, but not limited to, any change in, or
    to, the eligibility requirements, benefit formulae and manner
    and optional forms of payments.

         (c)  Any amendment or termination of the Plan prior to a
    Change in Control which (i) was at the request of a third
    party who has indicated an intention or taken steps
    reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or (ii)
    otherwise arose in connection with, or in anticipation of, a
    Change in Control, shall be null and void and shall have no
    effect whatsoever.

         (d)  In the event the Plan or any Plan Agreement is
    terminated or adversely amended to the detriment of any
    Participant and within a one-year period from the effective
    date of any such amendment or termination a Change in Control
    occurs, then any Participant so affected whose employment
    with Tandy Corporation is terminated, voluntarily or
    involuntarily, within a three-year period from the date of
    the Change in Control shall be entitled to receive those
    benefits set forth in Section 8.5 hereof to the same extent
    and in the same amounts as though such amendment or
    termination had not occurred.  This Section 10.2(d) shall not
    apply to any Participant who, on the date of the Change in
    Control, has previously retired or has otherwise voluntarily
    terminated his employment with Tandy Corporation.


                           ARTICLE ELEVEN

    expenses incurred in the prosecution of said suit including
    but not limited to attorneys' fees, court costs, and all
    other actual expenses.

    Section 11.8 Notwithstanding all other provisions in the
    Plan, in the event a Participant is entitled to benefits
    under two (2) separate sections of the Plan, the maximum a
    Participant may receive under this Plan is his Plan Benefit
    Amount, payable in accordance with Section 5.3 hereof.

                            ARTICLE FOUR

                           LIFE INSURANCE

    Section 4.1 Tandy may obtain permanent life insurance
    insuring the life of any Participant and others as a means of
    funding Tandy's obligations to his Beneficiary in whole or
    part.  Tandy shall be the sole owner and beneficiary of all
    such policies of insurance so obtained and of all incidents
    of ownership therein, including without limitation, the
    rights to all cash and loan values, dividends (if any), death
    benefits and the right to terminate.  No Beneficiary or
    Participant shall be entitled to any rights, interests or
    equities in such policies or to any specific asset of Tandy
    of any type, and on the contrary, their rights against Tandy
    under the Plan shall be solely as general creditors.

    Section 4.2 If as a result of misrepresentations made by a
    Participant in any application for life insurance upon his
    life obtained by Tandy hereunder, the insurance carrier or
    carriers or any reinsurance thereof successfully avoid(s)
    payment to Tandy of the proceeds of its or their policy or
    policies, or such proceeds are not payable because the
    Participant's death results from suicide within two (2) years
    of the issuance of such policy or within two (2) years of the
    issuance to Tandy of additional policies obtained by Tandy
    hereunder, then, in any of said events, and notwithstanding
    any other provisions of the Plan or of the Plan Agreement
    with such Participant, Tandy shall have no obligation to his
    Beneficiary to provide any of the death benefits otherwise
    payable under the terms thereof.

    Section 4.3 Each Participant shall cooperate in the securing

    as the insurance company may require, taking such physical
    examinations as may be necessary, and taking any other action
    which may be requested by Tandy or the insurance company to
    obtain such insurance coverage.  If a Participant refuses to
    cooperate in the securing of life insurance, then, the Plan
    Agreement shall be of no force and effect as to a Participant
    unless Tandy waives such requirement in writing.  All
    nonemployee Directors who become Participants at or after the
    age of seventy (70) years shall not be subject to the
    requirements of this Section 4.3.  The benefits conferred
    under this Plan are not contingent upon Tandy's being able to
    secure life insurance on a Participant, provided the
    Participant has met his obligations under Article Four.

                          ARTICLE FIVE

              BENEFITS PAYABLE TO PARTICIPANTS AND TO
                  BENEFICIARIES OF PARTICIPANTS

    Section 5.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
    upon Retirement of a Participant, Tandy agrees to pay to
    Participant a retirement benefit as follows:

         If a Participant retires at or prior to the age of
    seventy-two (72) years, excluding the Directors of Tandy were
    Directors of the Corporation on April 1, 1980, then, Tandy
    agrees to pay to Participant or to the designated Beneficiary
    of Participant in the event of the death of Participant prior
    to the termination of payment of Retirement benefits
    hereunder, all from its general assets, an amount equal to
    Plan Compensation times the number of years or a fraction
    thereof a Participant served as a nonemployee Director,
    reduced, in the event of the death of a Former Participant,
    by the amounts already paid hereunder to such Former
    Participant, such amounts to be paid as set forth in Section
    5.3 hereof.  If a Participant retires on the day following
    the date the Participant attains the age of seventy-two (72)
    years or thereafter, then, Tandy agrees to pay to participant
    or to the designated Beneficiary of Participant in the event
    of the death of Participant prior to the termination of
    payment of Retirement benefits hereunder, all from its
    general assets, an amount equal to Plan Compensation times
    the number of years or a fraction thereof a Participant
    served as a nonemployee Director, reduced in the event of the
    death of a Former Participant, by the amounts already paid
    hereunder to such Former Participant, reduced by a percentage
    determined as follows:

         At Date of Retirement,           Percent of Reduction
           Attainment of Age              of Plan Compensation

                  73                             33-1/3%
                  74                             66-2/3%
                  75                            100%

    The percent of reduction of Plan Compensation shall be
    measured on a fiscal year beginning on the date of a
    Participant's date of birth and shall commence on the day
    following the date a Participant attains age seventy-two
    (72), and any reduction for a part of a year shall be
    prorated on a daily basis at the applicable percentage
    assuming a 365-day year.  Such amount shall be paid as set
    forth in Section 5.3 hereof.

    Section 5.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
    upon the death of a Participant, or a Former Participant,
    Tandy agrees to pay to his Beneficiary from its general
    assets an amount set forth in Section 5.1 hereof.  Except for
    the method of payment, the death of a Participant shall be
    treated as though such Participant retired.

         (a)  No benefits shall be payable to the Beneficiary of
    a Participant in those instances covered by Section 4.2;

         (b)  The death of a Former Participant shall not defeat
    the right of such Participant's Beneficiary to receive
    benefits under this Section 5.2.

    Section 5.3 The aggregate amount payable upon the Retirement
    of a Director who was a Participant shall be paid in equal
    quarterly installments over a period equal to the number of
    years (or fraction thereof) that the retired Director served
    as a Director of Tandy or ten (10) years, whichever is the
    lesser period of time, and shall be paid on the last day of
    each calendar quarter in arrears, commencing on the last day
    of the calendar quarter after Retirement or after the
    Committee's receipt of a certified death or proof of death
    certificate verifying the Participant's death.  In the event
    of the death of a Participant or a Former Participant, the
    amount due to the Beneficiary shall be paid to Beneficiary in
    one (1) lump sum unless Participant has designated otherwise
    on the beneficiary designation form.  A Participant shall
    notify Tandy of Retirement by hand delivery or by certified
    or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage
    prepaid, of a written notice of Retirement specifying the
    effective date of Retirement, such written notice to be
    addressed to: Insurance Committee, or its successor or
    successors, of the Board of Directors, Tandy Corporation,
    1800 One Tandy Center, Fort Worth, Texas 76102.  Such notice
    shall be deemed to be received when actually received by said
    Insurance Committee at said address as may be changed from
    time to time in the Plan Agreements, as amended.

    Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary,
    if a Former Participant is receiving payments from Tandy
    under any other salary continuation plan or deferred
    compensation plan, because of prior employment by Tandy of
    such Former Participant, then no benefits or payments
    hereunder shall commence until all benefits under such other
    plan or plans have been paid in full by Tandy to the
    participant or beneficiaries of such plan or plans.

    Section 5.4 Until actually paid and delivered to the
    Participant or to the Beneficiary entitled to same, none of
    the benefits payable by Tandy under any Plan Agreement shall
    be liable for the debts or liabilities of either the
    Participant or his Beneficiary, nor shall the same be subject
    to seizure by any creditor of the Participant or his
    Beneficiary under any writ or proceeding at law, in equity or
    in bankruptcy.  Further, no Participant or Beneficiary shall
    have power to sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or in any
    manner anticipate or dispose of the benefits to which he is
    entitled or may become entitled under a Plan Agreement.

    Section 5.5

         (a)  During the period that Participant is a Director of
    Tandy or is receiving benefits under a Plan Agreement and for
    one (1) year after cessation of payment of benefits,
    Participant agrees that he will not, either directly or
    indirectly, within the United States of America or in any
    country of the world that Tandy sells, imports, exports,
    assembles, packages or furnishes its products, articles,
    parts, supplies, accessories or services or is causing them
    to be sold, imported, exported, assembled, packaged or
    furnished through related entities, representatives, agents,
    or otherwise, own, manage, operate, join, control, be
    employed by, be a consultant to, be a partner in, be a
    creditor of, engage in joint operations with, be a
    stockholder, officer or director of any corporation, sole
    proprietorship or business entity of any type, or participate
    in the ownership, management, direction, or control or in any
    other manner be connected with, any business of
    manufacturing, designing, programming, servicing, repairing,
    selling, leasing, or renting any products, articles, parts,
    supplies, accessories or services which is at the time of
    Participant's engaging in such conduct competitive with
    products, articles, parts, supplies, accessories or services
    manufactured, sold, imported, exported, assembled, packaged
    or furnished by Tandy, except as a shareholder owning less
    than five percent (5%) of the shares of a corporation whose
    shares are traded on a stock exchange or in the
    over-the-counter market by a member of the National
    Association of Securities Dealers.  In the event that a
    Participant takes Retirement and engages in any of the
    activities described in the immediately preceding sentence,
    or engaged in any of such activities prior to Retirement,
    then, without any further notification, and upon
    determination by the Committee that such a Participant is
    engaged or has engaged in such activities, such Committee's
    decision to be conclusive and binding upon all concerned, and
    notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or of the
    Plan Agreement with such Participant, Tandy's obligation to a
    Participant to pay any Retirement or death benefits hereunder
    shall automatically cease and terminate, and Tandy shall have
    no further obligation to such Participant or Beneficiary
    pursuant to the Plan or the Plan Agreement.  Tandy may
    enforce this provision by suit for damages which shall
    include but not be limited to all sums paid to Participant
    hereunder, or for injunction, or both.  The foregoing
    notwithstanding, it shall not be a violation of the foregoing
    provisions if a Participant's or Former Participant's alleged
    activities were not a violation at the time he entered into
    such activity but thereafter became in violation of the
    Section 5.5(a) because of Tandy's entry into the activity
    also.

         (b)  (i) Upon written request of the Chairman of the
    Board of Directors of Tandy, each Former Participant, who is
    receiving benefits hereunder, shall at all reasonable times
    and places make himself available for consultation concerning
    matters of interest to Tandy.  In the event that a Former
    Participant fails to perform the consultation services
    described in the immediately preceding sentence for a reason
    other than physical or mental incapacity, then, upon
    determination by the Committee that such a Former Participant
    has failed to perform such services, such Committee's
    decision is to be conclusive and binding upon all concerned,
    and notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or of
    the Plan Agreement with such Former Participant, Tandy's
    obligation to pay any retirement or death benefits hereunder
    shall cease and terminate and Tandy shall have no further
    obligation to such Former Participant or Beneficiary pursuant
    to the Plan or the Plan Agreement, unless the Former
    Participant gives Notice of Appeal to the Board of Directors
    of Tandy as provided in Section 5.1(b)(ii) below.

              (ii)  A Former Participant shall have 30 days from
    the date of mailing of a notice of termination of benefits by
    the Committee to the Former Participant's last known mailing
    address in which to deliver written Notice of Appeal to the
    Board of Directors of Tandy to either the Chairman of the
    Board or the Corporate Secretary of Tandy, such written
    notice to contain facts why the Committee's decision is
    factually incorrect.  No benefits will be paid under the Plan
    or Plan Agreement from the time the Committee's decision is
    made until such time as the Appeal is decided by the Board of
    Directors of Tandy.  Upon receipt of such written Notice of
    Appeal from a Former Participant, the Chairman of the Board
    shall have 120 days within which to present the appeal at a
    regularly or specially called meeting of the Board of
    Directors.  The Board of Directors of Tandy shall make a
    determination as to whether or not a Former Participant has
    failed to perform the consultation services required under
    Section 5.5(b)(i) hereof.  Notwithstanding any other
    provisions of the Plan or the Plan Agreement with such Former
    Participant, the Board of Directors' decision is to be
    conclusive and binding upon all concerned.  Following a
    decision by the Board of Directors to uphold the decision of
    the Committee, Tandy shall have no further obligation to pay
    such Participant or Beneficiary pursuant to the Plan or the
    Plan Agreement.  Following a Board decision to overturn the
    decision of the Committee, any unpaid past due benefits will
    be paid to the Former Participant or his Beneficiary (if
    applicable), pursuant to the Plan or the Plan Agreement.

    Section 5.6 Tandy may liquidate out of the interest of a
    Participant hereunder, but only as Retirement or death
    benefits become due and payable hereunder, any outstanding
    loan or loans or other indebtedness of a Participant.  Tandy
    may elect not to distribute Retirement or death benefits to
    any Participant or to a Beneficiary unless and until all
    unpaid loans or other indebtedness due to Tandy from such
    Participant, together with interest, have been paid in full.

    Section 5.7 Subject to termination or amendment of the Plan,
    Plan Agreement, or both, a Participant's participation in the
    Plan shall continue during his Disability.  A Participant who
    is Disabled shall notify Tandy of his date of Retirement as
    provided in Section 5.3 hereof.

                           ARTICLE SIX

                   BENEFICIARIES OF PARTICIPANTS

    Section 6.1 At the time of his acceptance of a Plan
    Agreement, a Participant shall be required to designate the
    Beneficiary to whom benefits under the Plan and his Plan
    Agreement will be payable upon his death.  A Beneficiary may
    be one (1) or more persons or entities, such as dependents,
    persons who are natural objects of the Participant's bounty,
    an inter vivos or testamentary trust, or his estate.  Such
    Beneficiaries may be designated contingently or successively
    as the Participant may direct.  The designation of his
    Beneficiary shall be made by the Participant on a beneficiary
    designation form to be furnished by the Committee and filed
    with it.

    Section 6.2 A Participant may change his Beneficiary, as he
    may desire, by filing new and amendatory beneficiary
    designation forms with the Committee.

    Section 6.3 In the event a Participant designates more than
    one (1) Beneficiary to receive benefit payments
    simultaneously, each such Beneficiary shall be paid such
    proportion of such benefits as the Participant shall have
    designated.  If no such percentage designation has been made,
    the Committee shall hold all benefit payments until the
    Beneficiaries agree as to the distribution of the funds or a
    judicial determination has been made.

    Section 6.4 If the designated Beneficiary dies before the
    Participant in question and no Beneficiary was successively
    named, or if the designated Beneficiary dies before complete
    payment of the deceased Participant's benefits have been made
    and no Beneficiary was successively named, the Committee
    shall direct that such benefits (or the balance thereof) be
    paid to those persons who are the deceased Participant's
    heirs-at-law determined in accordance with the laws of
    descent and distribution in force at the date hereof in the
    State of Texas for separate personal property, such
    determination to be made as though the Participant had died
    intestate and domiciled in Texas.

    Section 6.5 Whenever any person entitled to payments under
    this Plan shall be a minor or under other legal disability or
    in the sole judgment of the Committee shall otherwise be
    unable to apply such payments to his own best interest and
    advantage (as in the case of illness, whether mental or
    physical, or where the person not under legal disability is
    unable to preserve his estate for his own best interest), the
    Committee may in the exercise of its discretion direct all or
    any portion of such payments to be made in any one (1) or
    more of the following ways unless claims shall have been made
    therefor by an existing and duly appointed guardian,
    conservator, committee or other duly appointed legal
    representative, in which event payment shall be made to such
    representative:

         (1)  directly to such person unless such person shall be
    an infant or shall have been legally adjudicated incompetent
    at the time of the payment;

         (2)  to the spouse, child, parent or other blood
    relative to be expended on behalf of the person entitled or
    on behalf of those dependents as to whom the person entitled
    has the duty of support;

         (3)  to a recognized charity or governmental institution
    to be expended for the benefit of the person entitled or for
    the benefit of those dependents as to whom the person
    entitled has the duty of support; or

         (4)  to any other institution, approved by the
    Committee, to be expended for the benefit of the person
    entitled or for the benefit of those dependents as to whom
    the person entitled has the duty of support.

         The decision of the Committee will, in each case, be
    final and binding upon all persons and the Committee shall
    not be obliged to see to the proper application or
    expenditure of any payments so made.  Any payment made
    pursuant to the power herein conferred upon the Committee
    shall operate as a complete discharge of the obligations of
    Tandy and of the Committee.

    Section 6.6 If the Committee has any doubt as to the proper
    Beneficiary to receive payments hereunder, the Committee
    shall have the right to withhold such payments until the
    matter is finally adjudicated, or the Committee may direct
    Tandy to bring a suit for interpleader in any appropriate
    court, pay any amounts due into the court, and Tandy and/or
    Committee shall have the right to recover its reasonable
    attorney's fees from such proceeds so paid or to be paid. 
    Any payment made by the Committee, in good faith and in
    accordance with this Plan, shall fully discharge the
    Committee and Tandy from all further obligations with respect
    to such payments.

                     ARTICLE SEVEN

                 TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION

    Section 7.1 Except as provided in Sections 7.4 and 9.1
    hereof, termination of a Participant's service as a Director,
    whether by action of Tandy or the Participant's resignation,
    shall terminate the Participant's participation in the Plan. 
    Neither the Plan nor the Plan Agreement shall in any way
    obligate Tandy to continue the services of a Participant.

    Section 7.2 Except as provided in Sections 7.4 and 9.1
    hereof, participation in the Plan by a Participant shall also
    terminate if the Plan or his Plan Agreement is terminated by

    hereof, upon termination of a Participant's participation in
    the Plan, all of Tandy's obligations to the Participant and

    them, shall terminate and be of no further effect.

    Section 7.4 Except as provided in Section 9.1, if a
    Participant's participation in the Plan is terminated, by:

         (a)  termination of the Plan;

         (b)  termination of a Plan Agreement; or

         (c)  cessation to continue to serve as a Director for
              reasons other than dishonest or fraudulent conduct
              of a Participant or indictment of a Participant for
              a felony crime involving moral turpitude, in which
              event no vesting under Sections 7.4, 9.1 or Article
              Five shall occur,

    then such Participant shall be entitled to his Plan
    Compensation as set forth in Article Five hereof.

         The amount payable under this Section 7.4 shall be
    determined as of the date of the event set forth in Section
    7.4(a), (b) or (c) hereof and such amount as so determined at
    that time shall not be altered or changed thereafter except
    that the provisions of Section 5.5 hereof shall remain fully
    applicable during the Participant's engagement as a Director,
    during the payment of benefits under this Section 7.4 and for
    one (1) year after termination of service as a Director or
    payment of benefits.  The amount payable under this Section
    7.4 shall be paid as set forth in Section 5.3.

                           ARTICLE EIGHT

                     ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

    Section 8.1 The Plan shall be administered by the Committee
    of the Board of Directors of Tandy, as it is presently
    constituted or as it may be changed or substituted from time
    to time by the Board of Directors of Tandy.

    Section 8.2 In addition to the express powers and authorities
    accorded the Committee under the Plan, it shall be
    responsible for:

         (a)  Construing and interpreting the Plan;

         (b)  Computing and certifying to Tandy the amount of
    benefits to be provided in each Plan Agreement for the
    Participant or the Beneficiary of the Participant; and

         (c)  Determining the right of a Participant or a
    Beneficiary to payments under the Plan and otherwise
    authorizing disbursements of such payments by Tandy.

         In these and all other respects its decisions shall be
    conclusive and binding upon all concerned.

    Section 8.3 Tandy agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the
    members of the Committee against any and all expenses, claims
    and causes of action by or on behalf of any and all parties
    whomsoever, and all losses therefrom, including without
    limitation the cost of defense and attorney's fees, based
    upon or arising out of any act or omission relating to or in
    connection with the Plan other than losses resulting from any
    such Committee member's fraud or willful misconduct.

                           ARTICLE NINE

       TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN OR PLAN AGREEMENTS

    Section 9.1 Tandy reserves the right to terminate or amend
    this Plan or any Plan Agreement, in whole or in part, at any
    time, or from time to time, by resolution of the Board of
    Directors of Tandy, provided, however, no amendment to the
    Plan or to any Plan Agreement shall alter the vested rights
    of a Participant or Beneficiary applicable on the effective
    date of such termination or amendment and such vested rights
    shall remain unchanged.  Rights are deemed to have vested if
    benefits are actually being paid or if the only condition
    precedent to the payment of benefits is the termination of
    Participant's engagement as a Director of Tandy (unless
    terminated for reasons set forth in Section 7.4(c), in which
    event all benefits are forfeited) or the giving of notice of
    Retirement.

                           ARTICLE TEN

                          MISCELLANEOUS

    Plan or Plan Agreement, shall be deemed to include the
    feminine gender.  The words "herein", "hereunder" or other
    similar compounds of the word "here" shall mean and refer to
    the entire Plan and Plan Agreement, not to any particular
    provision, section or subsection, and words used in the
    singular or plural may be construed as though in the plural
    or singular where they would so apply.

    Section 10.3 Any suit against Tandy or the Committee or any
    member thereof concerning any provisions hereunder, the

    to have been born on the immediately preceding February 28

    Section 10.5 This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the
    benefit of any successor of Tandy and any such successor
    shall be deemed substituted for Tandy under the terms of this
    Plan.  As used in this Plan, the term "successor" shall
    include any person, firm, corporation, or other business
    entity which at any time, whether by merger, purchase, or
    otherwise, acquires all or substantially all of the assets or
    business of Tandy.

    Section 10.6 A Director shall not be required to mitigate the

    limited to attorney's fees, court costs, and all other actual
    expenses.

    Section 10.8 Notwithstanding all other provisions in the
    Plan, in the event a Director is entitled to benefits under
    two (2) separate sections of the Plan, the maximum a
    Participant may receive under this Plan is the amount set

                          TANDY CORPORATION
                       1985 STOCK OPTION PLAN
                       (Restated August, 1990)


    Section 1.  Establishment.

         Tandy Corporation, a Delaware corporation, ("Company")
    hereby establishes a stock option plan to be named the Tandy
    Corporation 1985 Stock Option Plan ("Plan") for officers and
    key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.

    Section 2.  Purpose.

         (a)  The purpose of the Plan is to induce officers and
    key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, who are in
    a position to contribute materially to the prosperity
    thereof, to remain with the Company or its subsidiaries, to
    offer them incentives and rewards in recognition of their
    share in the Company's progress, and to encourage them to
    continue to promote the best interests of the Company and its
    subsidiaries.  The Plan will also aid the Company and its
    subsidiaries in competing with other enterprises for the
    services of new key personnel needed to help insure their
    continued development.

         (b)  Options granted to an optionee shall be either
    Incentive Stock Options within the meaning of Section 422A of
    the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
    nonstatutory stock options.

    Section 3.  Administration.

         (a)  The Plan shall be administered by the Board of
    Directors (excluding directors who are eligible or have been
    eligible within the preceding 12 months to receive options,
    stock or stock appreciation rights under the Plan or any
    other plan of the Company or any of its affiliates) which
    shall, acting upon the recommendations of a committee of
    three or more directors not excluded as aforesaid (the
    "Committee") appointed or designated by the Board of
    Directors from time to time, determine the individuals to
    receive options, the time when they shall receive them, the
    number of shares to be subject to each option, and shall
    designate any such option as an Incentive Stock Option or a
    Nonstatutory Stock Option.

         (b)  The Board of Directors (or the Committee if so
    authorized by the Board of Directors) shall have the
    authority (i) to exercise all of the powers granted to it
    under the Plan, (ii) to construe, interpret and implement the
    Plan and any Stock Option Agreements executed pursuant to
    Section 14, (iii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and
    regulations relating to the Plan, (iv) to make all
    determinations necessary or advisable in administering the
    Plan, and (v) to correct any defect, supply any omission and
    reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan.

         (c)  The determination of the Board of Directors (or the
    Committee if so authorized by the Board of Directors) on all
    matters relating to the Plan or any Plan agreement shall be
    conclusive.

         (d)  No member of the Board of Directors or the
    Committee shall be liable for any action or determination
    made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award
    thereunder.

    Section 4.  Total Number of Shares to be Optioned.

         (a)  The number of shares of common stock ($1.00 par
    value) of the Company which may be issued upon exercise of
    options under the Plan shall not exceed two million
    (2,000,000) shares (subject to adjustment as provided in
    Section 11 hereof).  The shares sold under the Plan may be
    either issued shares reacquired by the Company at any time or
    authorized but unissued shares, as the Board of Directors
    from time to time may determine.

         (b)  In the event that any outstanding options under the
    Plan expire or are terminated for any reason, the shares of
    common stock of the Company allocable to the unexercised
    portion of all of such options may again be subject to the
    grant of options under the Plan.

    Section 5.  Eligibility.

         (a)  Options shall be granted only to officers and key
    employees of the Company or its subsidiaries who, if
    eligible, are active participants in the Tandy Corporation
    Stock Purchase Program.  The Committee will, in its
    discretion, determine the officers and key employees which it
    recommends to the Board of Directors be granted options, and
    will also recommend the time or times at which options be
    granted, the number of shares subject to each option, the
    manner in which options may be exercised and whether an
    option shall be designated as an Incentive Stock Option or as
    a Nonstatutory Stock Option.  In making such recommendation,
    the Committee may take into consideration the value of the
    services rendered by the respective individuals, their
    present and potential contributions to the success of the
    Company and its subsidiaries and such other factors which the
    Committee may deem relevant in accomplishing the purpose of
    the Plan.

         (b)  No director of the Company who is not also an
    employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries will be
    eligible for the grant of any options.

         (c)  No option may be granted to any individual who
    immediately after the option grant owns directly or
    indirectly stock possessing more than five (5%) percent of
    the total combined voting power or value of all classes of
    stock of the Company or any subsidiary.

    Section 6.  Limitation on Incentive Stock Options.

         (a)  General Rule.  Solely for federal income tax
    purposes, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value
    of stock with respect to which incentive stock options are
    exercisable for the first time by an individual during any
    calendar year exceeds $100,000.00, such options shall be
    treated as options which are not incentive stock options.
    This rule shall only apply to options granted on or after
    January 1, 1987.  For purposes of this rule, options shall be
    taken into account in the order in which they were granted.

         (b)  Fair Market Value.  Fair market value shall be
    deemed to be the average of the high and low prices of the
    common stock of the Company for composite transactions as
    published by a major newspaper for the date the Incentive
    Stock Option is granted or, if no sale of the Company's stock
    shall have been made on that day, the next preceding day on
    which there was a sale of such stock.

    Section 7.  Terms and Conditions of Options.

         Each option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by
    a Stock Option Agreement in such form not inconsistent with
    the Plan as the Board of Directors (or the Committee if so
    authorized by the Board of Directors) shall determine,
    provided that such Stock Option Agreement clearly and
    separately identifies Nonstatutory Stock Options and
    Incentive Stock Options and that the substance of the
    following terms and conditions be included therein:

         (a)  Option Price.  The price at which each share of
    common stock covered by such option may be purchased shall be
    determined by the Committee and shall be no less than one
    hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of the stock
    on the date the option is granted.  Fair market value shall
    be deemed to be the average of the high and low prices of the
    common stock of the Company for composite transactions as
    published by a major newspaper for the date the option is
    granted or, if no sale of the Company's stock shall have been
    made on that day, the next preceding day on which there was a
    sale of such stock.

         (b)  Nontransferable.  The option and any right related
    thereto shall not be transferable by the optionee otherwise
    than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and
    may be exercised, during the optionee's lifetime, only by the
    optionee.

         (c)  Exercise of Option.  The option and any right
    related thereto, if exercised by the optionee, may be
    exercised (subject, however, to the provisions of Section 9)
    only if the optionee has been an employee of the Company or
    of any subsidiary thereof at all times during the period
    beginning with the date of the granting of the option and
    ending on the day three (3) months before the date of such
    exercise; provided, however, that in the case of an optionee
    who becomes permanently and totally disabled or, in the case
    of Nonstatutory Options only, upon retirement at age 55 years
    or older, the three (3) months shall be extended to 12
    months.  Options granted to an employee under the Plan shall
    not be affected by any change of duties or position so long
    as the optionee continues to be an employee of the Company or
    of a subsidiary.  Subject to the provisions of Section 9(a),
    only those options exercisable at the date the optionee's
    employment is terminated may be exercised during the period
    following such termination, whether such termination is by
    retirement or otherwise.

         (d)  Term of Options.  An Incentive Stock Option shall
    not be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years
    from the date the option was granted; a Nonstatutory Stock
    Option shall not be exercisable after the expiration of ten
    (10) years and one (1) month from the date the option was
    granted.

         (e)  Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of an
    optionee while the optionee is in the employ of the Company
    or any subsidiary thereof, the outstanding options then held
    by such person and any rights related thereto shall be
    exercisable only within the twelve (12) months next
    succeeding such death, and then only by the executor or
    administrator of the optionee's estate or by the person or
    persons to whom the optionee's rights under the option shall
    pass by the optionee's will or the laws of descent and
    distribution, provided that in no event shall an Incentive
    Stock Option be exercisable more than ten (10) years or a
    Nonstatutory Stock Option more than ten (10) years and one
    (1) month after the date it was granted.

         (f)  In the event that any optionee shall be dismissed
    from the employ of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for
    any reason which in the opinion of the Board of Directors (or
    the Committee if so authorized by the Board of Directors)
    shall constitute good cause for dismissal, any option still
    held by such person at such time shall automatically
    terminate.  The decision of the Board of Directors (or the
    Committee if so acting) as to what shall constitute good
    cause for dismissal shall be final and binding upon all
    concerned.

         (g)  Sequential Exercise of Incentive Stock Options.  No
    Incentive Stock Option granted prior to December 31, 1986,
    shall be exercisable while there is outstanding any other
    Incentive Stock Option which was granted to the optionee at
    an earlier time to purchase stock in the Company or in any
    corporation which (as the time of the granting of such
    Incentive Stock Option) is a subsidiary of the Company, or in
    any predecessor of any of such corporations.  Incentive Stock
    Options granted after December 31, 1986, may be exercised in
    any order once they become exercisable pursuant to Section
    9(a).  For the purpose of this Section 7(g), an Incentive
    Stock Option which has not been exercised in full is
    outstanding until the expiration of the period during which,
    under its initial terms, it could have been exercised.  The
    cancellation of an earlier Incentive Stock Option will not
    enable a subsequent Incentive Stock Option to be exercised
    any sooner.

    Section 8.  Employment at Will.

         Nothing contained in the Plan, or in any option granted
    pursuant to the Plan, nor in any agreement made pursuant to
    the provisions of this Section 8, shall confer upon any
    optionee any right with respect to continuance of employment
    by the Company or its subsidiaries, nor interfere in any way
    with the right of the Company or its subsidiaries to
    terminate the optionee's employment at will or change the
    optionee's compensation at any time.

    Section 9.  Exercise of Options--Purchase of Shares.

         (a)  No option shall be exercisable until the expiration
    of one year from date of grant and, unless otherwise
    determined by the Board of Directors (or the Committee if so
    authorized by the Board of Directors) shall (i) in the case
    of Incentive Stock Options, be then exercisable as to 33-1/3%
    of the total number of shares subject thereto, and
    exercisable as to an additional 33-1/3 on each of the two (2)
    succeeding anniversaries and (ii) in the case of Nonstatutory
    Stock Options, be then exercisable as to 20% of the total
    number of shares subject thereto, and exercisable as to an
    additional 20% on each of the four (4) succeeding
    anniversaries.  The right to purchase shares with respect to
    options which become exercisable in installments shall be
    cumulative.  Notwithstanding the grant of options initially
    exercisable in installments, upon the death or total
    disability of any optionee, all options then held shall
    become immediately exercisable without regard to dates at
    which the installments are exercisable and upon the
    retirement of any optionee at age 55 or older the Board of
    Directors (or the Committee if so authorized by the Board of
    Directors) may in its discretion accelerate the dates at
    which remaining installments of options may be exercised to
    the date of retirement.

         (b)  An option shall be exercisable for the purchase of
    shares only upon payment to the Company of the full purchase
    price of the shares with respect to which the option is
    exercised as provided elsewhere herein, provided, however,
    that the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver
    any certificates for shares of stock purchased upon the
    exercise of an option prior to (i) the obtaining of any
    approval from any governmental agency which the Company
    shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or
    advisable, and (ii) the completion of any registration or
    other qualification of such shares under any state or federal
    law or ruling or regulations of any governmental body which
    the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be
    necessary or advisable and, in addition, if shares reserved
    for issuance upon exercise of options shall not then be
    registered under the Securities Act of 1933 the Company may,
    upon exercise of an option, require the holder thereof (or a
    purchaser acting under Section 7(e) hereof) to represent in
    writing that he is acquiring the shares for investment and
    not with a view to distribution thereof, and may mark the
    certificate(s) for the shares with a legend restricting
    transfer and may issue stop transfer orders relating to such
    certificate to the transfer agent.

         (c)  Payment for the shares shall be either in United
    States dollars, payable in cash or by check, or by surrender
    of stock certificates representing like common stock of the
    Company having an aggregate fair market value, determined as
    of the date of exercise, equal to the number of shares with
    respect to which such option is exercised multiplied by the
    option price per share, or a combination of cash and common
    stock; provided that the Board of Directors (or the Committee
    if so authorized by the Board of Directors) may in the Stock
    Option Agreements impose whatever restrictions it deems
    necessary or desirable with respect to the payment for shares
    by the surrender of stock certificates representing like
    common stock of the Company.  The fair market value of common
    stock on the date of exercise of an option shall be
    determined in the same manner as the fair market value of
    common stock on the date of grant of an option is determined
    pursuant to Section 7(a).  Such payment shall be accompanied
    by a written request for the shares purchased.  An option
    shall be deemed exercised on the date such payment and
    written request are received by the Secretary of the Company.

    Section 10.  Acceleration of Exercisability on Change in Control.

         (a)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan or
    in the Stock Option Agreement evidencing any option to the
    contrary, in the event of a Change in Control (as hereinafter
    defined), then each option shall become exercisable on the
    date of the Change in Control, for the purchase of the full
    number of shares subject to such option.

         (b)  For purposes of the Plan, Change in Control shall
    mean any of the following events:

         (1)  An acquisition (other than directly from the
    Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting
    Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person is used for
    purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) immediately after
    which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
    meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided,
    however, in determining whether a Change in Control has
    occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a
    "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
    constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in
    Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an
    acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a trust
    forming a part thereof) maintained by (a) the Company or (b)
    any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its
    voting power or its voting equity securities or equity
    interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company
    (for purposes of this Section 10, a "Subsidiary"), (2) the
    Company or its Subsidiaries, or (3) any Person in connection
    with a "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter defined).

         (2)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990, are
    members of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any
    reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the Board;
    provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for
    election by the Company's stockholders, of any new director
    was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
    Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of
    this Plan, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board;
    provided further, however, that no individual shall be
    considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
    initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or
    threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11
    promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

         (3)  Approval by stockholders of the Company of:

         (i)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization involving
    the Company, unless:

         (I)  the stockholders of the Company, immediately before
    such merger, consolidation or reorganization, own, directly
    or indirectly immediately following such merger,
    consolidation or reorganization, at least sixty percent (60%)
    of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting
    securities of the corporation resulting from such merger or
    consolidation or reorganization (the "Surviving Corporation")
    in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of
    the Voting Securities immediately before such merger,
    consolidation or reorganization,

         (II)  the individuals who were members of the Incumbent
    Board immediately prior to the execution of the agreement
    providing for such merger, consolidation or reorganization
    constitute at least two-thirds of the members of the board of
    directors of the Surviving Corporation,

         (III)  no Person (other than the Company, any
    Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan (or any trust forming a
    part thereof) maintained by the Company, the Surviving
    Corporation, or any Subsidiary, or any Person who,
    immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or
    reorganization had Beneficial Ownership of fifteen percent
    (15%) or more of the then outstanding Voting Securities) has
    Beneficial Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
    combined voting power of the Surviving Corporation's then
    outstanding voting securities, and

         (IV)  a transaction described in clauses (I) through
    (III) shall herein be referred to as a "Non-Control
    Transaction";

         (ii)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or

         (iii)  An agreement for the sale or other disposition of
    all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any
    Person (other than a transfer to a Subsidiary).

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall
    not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the
    "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than
    the permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as
    a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the
    Company which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
    Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
    any additional Voting Securities which increases the
    percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in
    Control shall occur.

    Section 11.  Change in Stock, Adjustments, Etc.

         (a)  In the event that the outstanding shares of common
    stock of the Company are hereafter increased or decreased or
    changed into or exchanged for a different number of shares or
    kind of shares or other securities of the Company or of
    another corporation, or shares of a subsidiary are
    distributed to shareholders of the Company, by reason of
    reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
    reclassification, stock split up, combination of shares, or a
    dividend payable in common stock, the number and kind of
    shares for the purchase of which options may be granted under
    the Plan shall be automatically adjusted to reflect the
    change.  In addition, there shall be an appropriate
    adjustment in the number and kind of shares as to which
    outstanding options, or portions thereof then unexercised,
    shall be exercisable, to the end that the optionee's
    proportionate interest shall be maintained as before the
    occurrence of such event, and such adjustment of outstanding
    options shall be made without change of the total price
    applicable to the unexercised portion of the option and with
    a corresponding adjustment in the option price per share;
    provided, however, that each such adjustment in the number
    and kind of shares subject to outstanding options, including
    any adjustment in the option price, shall be made in such
    manner as not to constitute a modification as defined in
    Section 425 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
    The determination of any adjustment by the Board of Directors
    (or the Committee if so authorized by the Board of Directors)
    shall be conclusive.

         (b)  The grant of an option pursuant to the Plan shall
    not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to
    make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or
    changes of its capital or business structure or to merge or
    to consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate or sell, or transfer
    all or any part of its business or assets.

    Section 12.  Duration, Amendment and Termination.

         (a)  The Board of Directors of the Company may at any
    time terminate the Plan or make such amendments thereof as it
    shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the
    Company, without further action on the part of the
    stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that no such
    termination or amendment shall, without the consent of the
    individual to whom any option shall theretofore have been
    granted, affect or impair the rights of such individual under
    such option, and provided further, that unless the
    stockholders of the Company shall have first approved
    thereof, no amendment of this Plan shall be made whereby 

         (1)  the total number of shares which may be optioned
    under the Plan to all individuals, or any of them, shall be
    increased, except by operation of the adjustment provisions
    of Section 11 hereof;

         (2)  the class of employees to whom options may be
    granted shall be changed; or

         (3)  the benefits accruing to participants under the
    Plan shall be materially increased.

         (b)  No options shall be granted under the Plan after
    November 13, 1995, but options granted prior to or as of such
    date may extend beyond such date in accordance with the
    provisions hereof.

         (c)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan or
    in the Stock Option Agreement evidencing any option to the
    contrary, Section 10 and this Section 12(c) shall not be
    amended or terminated at any time.

    Section 13.  Effectiveness of Plan.

         This Plan shall not become effective unless and until
    the following conditions shall have been met:

         (a)  The Plan shall have been adopted by the affirmative
    vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company
    present and entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders
    at which a quorum is present within one (1) year of its
    approval by the Board of Directors.

         (b)  The Board of Directors shall have been advised by
    counsel that all other applicable legal requirements incident
    to the establishment and operation of the Plan have been
    complied with.

    Section 14.  Date of Granting of Options.

         The granting of an option pursuant to the Plan shall
    take place on any date the Board of Directors decides to
    grant the option, following approval of the Plan by the
    shareholders of the Company.  Within 30 days of the granting
    of the option, the Company shall notify the optionee of the
    grant of the option, and submit to the optionee a Stock
    Option Agreement duly executed by and on behalf of the
    Company, with the request that the optionee execute and
    return the agreement within 30 days thereafter.  If the
    optionee shall fail to return the executed Stock Option
    Agreement within said 30-day period, such person's option
    shall be automatically terminated.

    Section 15.  Application of Funds.

         The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of
    stock subject to option are to be added to the general funds
    of the Company and used for its corporate purposes as the
    Board of Directors shall determine.

    Section 16.  No Obligation to Exercise Option.

         Granting of an option shall impose no obligation on the
    optionee to exercise such option.


    Tandy Corporation 1985 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") was
    originally adopted by the Board of Directors on August 16,
    1985, and approved by the Shareholders of Tandy Corporation
    on November 14, 1985.  This copy of the Plan has been
    restated to include amendments to the Plan pursuant to
    resolutions approved by the board of Directors at special
    meetings held on January 23, 1987; August 27, 1987; January
    26, 1990; and August 22, 1990.

                 OFFICERS LIFE INSURANCE PLAN


         During employment the Corporation provides group life
    insurance to its officers at the rate of two times (up to a
    maximum of $400,000) or three times (up to a maximum of
    $900,000) total compensation, depending upon the officer's
    position with the Corporation.  The insurance is paid to the
    officer's beneficiary in a lump sum.  The sum payable reduces
    by 50% at age 70.  If an officer's death is by accidental
    means, the payment to the beneficiary includes an additional
    amount equal to twice the face amount (up to $100,000) of the
    policy.

         The Officers Life Insurance Plan provides that, for one
    (1) year following the occurrence of a change in control, the
    plan shall not be terminated or amended in any way, nor shall
    the manner in which the plan is administered be changed in
    any way which adversely affects the rights of any employee
    for which the plan is maintained immediately prior to the
    change in control, to existing or future benefits or
    contributions or the computation, amount of, or entitlement
    to, any benefit provided under the plan.

                                FORM OF
                     TERMINATION PROTECTION AGREEMENT
                         FOR CORPORATE EXECUTIVES

         THIS AGREEMENT made as of the _______ day of August,
    1990, by and between the "Company" (as hereinafter defined)
    and ______________ (the "Executive").

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the
    "Board") recognizes that the possibility of a "Change in
    Control" (as hereinafter defined) exists and that the threat
    or the occurrence of a Change in Control can result in
    significant distractions of its key management personnel
    because of the uncertainties inherent in such a situation;

         WHEREAS, the Board has determined that it is essential
    and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders
    to retain the services of the Executive in the event of a
    threat or occurrence of a Change in Control and to ensure
    [his or her] continued dedication and efforts in such event
    without undue concern for [his or her] personal financial and
    employment security; and

         WHEREAS, in order to induce the Executive to remain in
    the employ of the Company and the Employer, particularly in
    the event of a threat or the occurrence of a Change in
    Control, the Company desires to enter into this Agreement
    with the Executive to provide the Executive with certain
    benefits in the event [his or her] employment is terminated
    as a result of, or in connection with, a Change in Control
    and to provide the Executive with the "Gross-Up Payment" (as
    hereinafter defined) and certain other benefits whether or
    not the Executive's employment is terminated.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective
    agreements of the parties contained herein, it is agreed as
    follows:

         1.  Term of Agreement.  This Agreement shall commence as
    of August 22, 1990 and shall continue in effect until August
    22, 1992; provided, however, that commencing on August 22,
    1991 and on each August 22 thereafter, the term of this
    Agreement shall be automatically extended for one (1) year
    unless either the Company or the Executive shall have given
    written notice to the other at least ninety (90) days prior
    thereto that the term of this Agreement shall not be so
    extended; and provided, further, however, that
    notwithstanding any such notice by the Company not to extend,
    the term of this Agreement shall not expire prior to the
    expiration of twenty-four (24) months after the occurrence of
    a Change in Control.

         2.  Definitions.

              2.1.  Accrued Compensation.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Accrued Compensation" shall mean an amount which
    shall include all amounts earned or accrued through the
    "Termination Date" (as hereinafter defined) but not paid as
    of the Termination Date including (i) base salary, and (ii)
    reimbursement for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred
    by the Executive on behalf of the Company during the period
    ending on the Termination Date, (iii) vacation pay, if
    required by applicable law, and (iv) bonuses and incentive
    compensation (other than the "Pro Rata Bonus" (as hereinafter
    defined)).

              2.2.  Base Amount.  For purposes of this Agreement,
    "Base Amount" shall mean the greater of the Executive's
    annual base salary (a) at the rate in effect on the
    Termination Date or (b) at the highest rate in effect at any
    time during the ninety (90) day period prior to the Change in
    Control, and shall include all amounts of [his or her] base
    salary that are deferred under the qualified and
    non-qualified employee benefit plans of the Company.

              2.3.  Bonus Amount.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Bonus Amount" shall mean the highest annual bonus
    paid or payable to the Executive for any fiscal year in
    respect of the three (3) full fiscal years ended prior to the
    Change in Control.

              2.4.  Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, a
    termination of employment is for "Cause" if the Executive has
    been convicted of a felony or the termination is evidenced by
    a resolution adopted in good faith by two-thirds of the Board
    that the Executive (a) intentionally and continually failed
    substantially to perform [his or her] reasonably assigned
    duties with the Company (other than a failure resulting from
    the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness
    or from the Executive's assignment of duties that would
    constitute "Good Reason" as hereinafter defined) which
    failure continued for a period of at least thirty (30) days
    after a written notice of demand for substantial performance
    has been delivered to the Executive specifying the manner in
    which the Executive has failed substantially to perform, or
    (b) intentionally engaged in conduct which is demonstrably
    and materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or
    otherwise; provided, however, that no termination of the
    Executive's employment shall be for Cause as set forth in
    clause (b) above until (x) there shall have been delivered to
    the Executive a copy of a written notice setting forth that
    the Executive was guilty of the conduct set forth in clause
    (b) and specifying the particulars thereof in detail, and (y)
    the Executive shall have been provided an opportunity to be
    heard in person by the Board (with the assistance of the
    Executive's counsel if the Executive so desires).  No act,
    nor failure to act, on the Executive's part, shall be
    considered "intentional" unless the Executive has acted, or
    failed to act, with a lack of good faith and with a lack of
    reasonable belief that the Executive's action or failure to
    act was in the best interest of the Company.

              2.5.  Change in Control.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall mean any of the
    following events:

                   (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from
    the Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the
    "Voting Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person is
    used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"))
    immediately after which such Person has "Beneficial
    Ownership" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
    under the 1934 Act) of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
    combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
    Voting Securities; provided, however, that in determining
    whether a Change in Control has occurred, Voting Securities
    which are acquired in a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as
    hereinafter defined) shall not constitute an acquisition
    which would cause a Change in Control.  A "Non-Control
    Acquisition" shall mean an acquisition by (1) an employee
    benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained
    by (x) the Company or (y) any corporation or other Person of
    which a majority of its voting power or its equity securities
    or equity interest is owned directly or indirectly by the
    Company (a "Subsidiary"), (2) the Company or any Subsidiary,
    or (3) any Person in connection with a "Non-Control
    Transaction" (as hereinafter defined).

                   (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22,
    1990, are members of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease
    for any reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the
    Board; provided, however, that if the election, or nomination
    for election by the Company's stockholders, of any new
    director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
    Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of
    this Agreement, be considered as a member of the Incumbent
    Board; provided further, however, that no individual shall be
    considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
    initially asssumed office as a result of either an actual or
    threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11
    promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

                   (c)  Approval by stockholders of the Company
    of:
     
                        (1)  A merger, consolidation or
                   reorganization involving the Company, unless

                        (i) the stockholders of the Company,
                        immediately before such merger,
                        consolidation or reorganization, own,
                        directly or indirectly immediately
                        following such merger, consolidation
                        or reorganization, at least sixty percent
                        (60%) of the combined voting power of the
                        outstanding voting securities of the
                        corporation resulting from such merger or
                        consolidation or reorganization (the
                        "Surviving Corporation") in substantially
                        the same proportion as their ownership of
                        the Voting Securities immediately before
                        such merger, consolidation or
                        reorganization,

                        (ii) the individuals who were members of
                        the Incumbent Board immediately prior to
                        the execution of the agreement providing
                        for such merger, consolidation or
                        reorganization constitute at least
                        two-thirds of the members of the board of
                        directors of the Surviving Corporation,

                        (iii) no Person (other than the Company,
                        any Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan
                        (or any trust forming a part thereof)
                        maintained by the Company, the Surviving
                        Corporation or any Subsidiary, or any
                        Person who, immediately prior to such
                        merger, consolidation or reorganization
                        had Beneficial Ownership of fifteen
                        percent (15%) or more of the then
                        outstanding Voting Securities) has
                        Beneficial Ownership of fifteen percent
                        (15%) or more of the combined voting
                        power of the Surviving Corporation's then
                        outstanding voting securities, and

                        (iv) a transaction described in clauses
                        (i) through (iii) shall herein be
                        referred to as a "Non-Control
                        Transaction";

                        (2) A complete liquidation or dissolution
                   of the Company; or

                        (3) An agreement for the sale or other
                   disposition of all or substantially all of the
                   assets of the Company to any Person (other
                   than a transfer to a Subsidiary).

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not
    be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject
    Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the
    permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a
    result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company
    which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
    Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
    any additional Voting Securities which increases the
    percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in
    Control shall occur.

                   (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in
    this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive's employment
    is terminated following the Effective Date but within one (1)
    year prior to a Change in Control and [the Executive
    reasonably demonstrates that] such termination (i) was at the
    request of a third party who has indicated an intention or
    taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in
    Control and who effectuates a Change in Control (a "Third
    Party") or (ii) otherwise occurred in connection with, or in
    anticipation of, a Change in Control which actually occurs,
    then for all purposes of this Agreement, the date of a Change
    in Control with respect to the Executive shall mean the date
    immediately prior to the date of such termination of the
    Executive's employment.

              2.6.  Company.  For purposes of this Agreement, the
    "Company" shall mean Tandy Corporation and shall include its
    "Successors and Assigns" (as hereinafter defined).

              2.7.  Disability.  For purposes of this Agreement,
    "Disability" shall mean a physical or mental infirmity which
    impairs the Executive's ability to substantially perform [his
    or her] duties with the Company for a period of one hundred
    eighty (180) consecutive days and the Executive has not
    returned to [his or her] full time employment prior to the
    Termination Date as stated in the "Notice of Termination" (as
    hereinafter defined).

              2.8.  (a) Good Reason.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence after a
    Change in Control of any of the events or conditions
    described in Subsections (i) through (ix) hereof:

                   (i)  a change in the Executive's status,
              title, position or responsibilities (including
              reporting responsibilities) which, in the
              Executive's reasonable judgment, represents an
              adverse change in [his or her] status, title,
              position or responsibilities as in effect at any
              time within ninety (90) days preceding the date of
              the Change in Control or at any time thereafter;
              the assignment to the Executive of any duties or
              responsibilities which, in the Executive's
              reasonable judgment, are inconsistent with such
              status, title, position or responsibilities as in
              effect at any time within ninety (90) days
              preceding the date of the Change in Control or at
              any time thereafter; or any removal of the
              Executive from or failure to reappoint or reelect
              [him or her] to any of [his or her] offices or
              positions, except in connection with the
              termination of the Executive's employment for
              Cause, or as a result of [his or her] death, or by
              the Executive other than for Good Reason;

                   (ii)  a reduction in the rate of the
              Executive's base salary below the Base Amount or
              any failure to pay the Executive any compensation
              or benefits to which [he or she] is entitled within
              fifteen (15) days of the date notice of such
              failure to pay is given to the Company and, in the
              case of any annual bonus, within forty-five (45)
              days following the end of the fiscal year pursuant
              to which such bonus relates;

                   (iii)  a change in the accounting policies or
              practices as in effect during the ninety (90) days
              preceding the Change in Control or at any time
              thereafter which, in the Executive's reasonable
              judgment, results in a reduction in [his or her]
              earning potential;

                   (iv)  the Company's requiring the Executive to
              be based at any place outside a 20-mile radius from
              [his or her] place of employment on the day prior
              to the Change in Control, except for reasonably
              required travel on the Company's business which is
              not materially greater than such travel
              requirements prior to the Change in Control;

                   (v)  the failure by the Company to
              (A) continue in effect (without reduction in
              benefit levels, reward opportunities and/or bonus
              potential for comparable performance) any material
              compensation or benefit plan in which the Executive
              was participating at any time within ninety (90)
              days preceding the Change in Control or at any time
              thereafter including, but not limited to, the plans
              listed on Appendix A, unless such plan is replaced
              with a plan that provides substantially equivalent
              compensation or benefits to the Executive, or
              (B) provide the Executive with compensation and
              benefits, in the aggregate at least equal (in terms
              of benefit levels and/or reward opportunities) to
              those provided for under each other employee
              benefit plan, program and practice in which the
              Executive was participating at any time within
              ninety (90) days preceding the Change in Control or
              at any time thereafter;

                   (vi)  the insolvency or the filing (by any
              party, including the Company) of a petition for
              bankruptcy, of the Company, which petition is not
              dismissed within sixty (60) days;

                   (vii)  any material breach by the Company of
              any provision hereof;

                   (viii)  any purported termination of the
              Executive's employment for Cause by the Company
              which does not comply with the terms of Section 2.4
              hereof; and

                   (ix)  the failure of the Company to obtain an
              agreement, satisfactory to the Executive, from any
              Successor or Assign of the Company, to assume and
              agree to perform this Agreement, as contemplated in
              Section 6 hereof.

                   (b) Any event or condition described in this
    Section 2.8(a)(i) through (ix) which occurs following the
    Effective Date but within one (1) year prior to a Change in
    Control but which the Executive reasonably demonstrates (i)
    was at the request of a Third Party or (ii) otherwise arose
    in connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in
    Control which actually occurs, shall constitute Good Reason
    for purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding that it
    occurred prior to the Change in Control.

              2.9.  Notice of Termination.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, following a Change in Control, "Notice of
    Termination" shall mean a written notice of termination from
    the Company of the Executive's employment which indicates the
    specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon
    and which sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and
    circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of
    the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.

              2.10.  Pro Rata Bonus.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Pro Rata Bonus" shall mean an amount equal to the
    Bonus Amount multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
    is the number of days in the fiscal year through the
    Termination Date and the denominator of which is 365.

              2.11.  Successors and Assigns.  For purposes of
    this Agreement, "Successors and Assigns" shall mean a
    corporation or other entity acquiring all or substantially
    all the assets and business of the Company (including this
    Agreement) whether by operation of law or otherwise.

              2.12.  Termination Date.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Termination Date" shall mean in the case of the
    Executive's death, [his or her] date of death, in the case of
    Good Reason, the last day of [his or her] employment, and in
    all other cases, the date specified in the Notice of
    Termination; provided, however, that if the Executive's
    employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or due to
    Disability, the date specified in the Notice of Termination
    shall be at least 30 days from the date the Notice of
    Termination is given to the Executive, provided that in the
    case of Disability the Executive shall not have returned to
    the full-time performance of [his or her] duties during such
    period of at least 30 days.

         3.  Termination of Employment.

              3.1.  If, during the term of this Agreement, the
    Executive's employment with the Company shall be terminated
    within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control,
    the Executive shall be entitled to the following compensation
    and benefits:

                   (a)  If the Executive's employment with the
    Company shall be terminated (1) by reason of the Executive's
    death, (2) by the Company for Cause or Disability, or (3) by
    the Executive other than for Good Reason and other than
    during the 60-day period commencing on the first anniversary
    of the date of the occurrence of a Change in Control (the
    "Window Period"), the Company shall pay to the Executive the
    Accrued Compensation and, if such termination is other than
    by the Company for Cause, a Pro Rata Bonus.

                   (b)  If the Executive's employment with the
    Company shall be terminated for any reason other than as
    specified in Section 3.1(a) or during the Window Period, the
    Executive shall be entitled to the following:

                   (i)  the Company shall pay the Executive all
    Accrued Compensation and a Pro-Rata Bonus;

                   (ii)  the Company shall pay the Executive as
    termination pay and in lieu of any further compensation for
    periods subsequent to the Termination Date, in a single
    payment an amount (the "Termination Amount") in cash equal to
    two times the sum of (A) the Base Amount and (B) the Bonus
    Amount;

                   (iii)  for twenty-four (24) months from the
    Termination Date (the "Continuation Period"), the Company
    shall at its expense continue on behalf of the Executive and
    [his or her] dependents and beneficiaries the fringe
    benefits, (excluding those benefit plans numbered 1 through 8
    inclusive on Appendix A but including an automobile or
    automobile allowance and the related expenses of public
    liability insurance, collision coverage, repairs and
    maintenance) and the life insurance, disability, medical,
    dental and hospitalization benefits provided (x) to the
    Executive at any time during the 90-day period prior to the
    Change in Control or at any time thereafter or (y) to other
    similarly situated executives who continue in the employ of
    the Company during the Continuation Period; provided,
    however, that with respect to any Executive who was entitled
    to the use of an automobile provided by the Company within
    the ninety (90) day period prior to a Change in Control or at
    any time thereafter, the Executive shall be paid a cash
    payment equal to the value of the Company provided automobile
    to the Executive for the Continuation Period.  The coverage
    and benefits (including deductibles and contributions by the
    Executive, if any) provided in this Section 3.1(b)(iii)
    during the Continuation Period shall be no less favorable to
    the Executive and [his or her] dependents and beneficiaries,
    than the most favorable of such coverages and benefits during
    any of the periods referred to in clauses (x) and (y) above. 
    The Company's obligation hereunder with respect to the
    foregoing benefits (except for the automobile or automobile
    allowance and the related expenses of public liability
    insurance, collision coverage, repairs and maintenance) shall
    be limited to the extent that the Executive obtains any such
    benefits pursuant to a subsequent employer's benefit plans,
    in which case the Company may reduce the coverage of any
    benefits it is required to provide the Executive hereunder as
    long as the aggregate coverages and benefits of the combined
    benefit plans is no less favorable to the Executive than the
    coverages and benefits required to be provided hereunder. 
    This Subsection (iii) shall not be interpreted so as to limit
    any benefits to which the Executive, [his or her] dependents
    or beneficiaries may be entitled under any of the Company's
    employee benefit plans, programs or practices following the
    Executive's termination of employment, including without
    limitation, retiree medical and life insurance benefits;

                   (iv)  the Company shall pay in a single
    payment an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the
    maximum amount the Executive could have contributed under the
    Deferred Salary and Investment Plan, Stock Purchase Program
    and Supplemental Stock Program as in effect on the date
    immediately prior to the Change in Control during the
    Continuation Period had [he or she] continued in the
    employment with the Company during the Continuation Period at
    the greater of [his or her] annualized gross salary and wages
    as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control or at
    any time thereafter; and 

                   (v)  (A) the restrictions on any outstanding
    incentive awards (including restricted stock and granted
    performance shares or units) granted to the Executive
    including, but not limited to, awards granted under the
    Company's 1985 Stock Option Plan, or under any other
    incentive plan or arrangement shall lapse and such incentive
    award shall become 100% vested, all stock options and stock
    appreciation rights granted to the Executive shall become
    immediately exercisable and shall become 100% vested, and all
    performance units granted to the Executive shall become 100%
    vested and (B) the Executive shall have the right to require
    the Company to purchase, for cash, any shares of unrestricted
    stock or shares purchased upon exercise of any options, at a
    price equal to the fair market value of such shares on the
    date of purchase by the Company.

                   (c)  The amounts provided for in Sections
    3.1(a) and 3.1(b)(i), (ii), (iii) (only as to the automobile
    allowance and the related expenses of public liablity
    insurance, collision coverage, repairs and maintenance) and
    (iv) shall be paid in a single lump sum cash payment within
    five (5) days after the Executive's Termination Date (or
    earlier, if required by applicable law).

                   (d)  The Executive shall not be required to
    mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this
    Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise and no
    such payment shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any
    compensation or benefits provided to the Executive in any
    subsequent employment except as provided in Section
    3.1(b)(iii).

              3.2.  (a)  The termination pay and termination
    benefits provided for in this Section 3 shall be in lieu of
    any other severance or termination pay to which the Executive
    may be entitled under any Company severance or termination
    plan, program, policy or practice.

                   (b)  The Executive's entitlement to any other
    compensation or benefits (other than the Pro Rata Bonus and
    other than the termination pay and termination benefits as
    provided under this Section 3) shall be determined in
    accordance with the Company's employee benefit plans
    (including, the plans listed on Appendix A) and other
    applicable programs, policies and practices then in effect.

         4.  Notice of Termination.  Following a Change in
    Control, any purported termination of the Executive's
    employment by the Company and/or the Employer shall be
    communicated by Notice of Termination to the Executive.  For
    purposes of this Agreement, no such purported termination
    shall be effective without such Notice of Termination.

         5.  Excise Tax Payments.

              (a)  In the event that any payment or benefit
    (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), to the
    Executive or for [his or her] benefit paid or payable or
    distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this
    Agreement or otherwise in connection with, or arising out of,
    [his or her] employment with the Company or a change in
    ownership or effective control of the Company or of a
    substantial portion of its assets (a "Payment" or
    "Payments"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by
    Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are
    incurred by the Exeuctive with respect to such excise tax
    (such excise tax, together with any such interest and
    penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    "Excise Tax"), then the Executive will be entitled to receive
    an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount
    such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes
    (including any interest or penalties, other than interest and
    penalties imposed by reason of the Executive's failure to
    file timely a tax return or pay taxes shown due on [his or
    her] return, imposed with respect to such taxes and the
    Excise Tax), including any Excise Tax imposed upon the
    Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the
    Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the
    Payments.

                   (b)  An initial determination as to whether a
    Gross-Up Payment is required pursuant to this Agreement and
    the amount of such Gross-Up Payment shall be made at the
    Company's expense by an accounting firm selected by the
    Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive which is
    designated as one of the five largest accounting firms in the
    United States (the "Accounting Firm").  The Accounting Firm
    shall provide its determination (the "Determination"),
    together with detailed supporting calculations and
    documentation to the Company and the Executive within five
    days of the Termination Date if applicable, or such other
    time as requested by the Company or by the Executive
    (provided the Executive reasonably believes that any of the
    Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax) and if the
    Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by
    the Executive with respect to a Payment or Payments, it shall
    furnish the Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable
    to the Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with
    respect to any such Payment or Payments.  Within ten days of
    the delivery of the Determination to the Executive, the
    Executive shall have the right to dispute the Determination
    (the "Dispute").  The Gross-Up Payment, if any, as determined
    pursuant to this Paragraph 5(b) shall be paid by the Company
    to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the
    Accounting Firm's determination.  The existence of the
    Dispute shall not in any way affect the Executive's right to
    receive the Gross-Up Payment in accordance with the
    Determination.  If there is no Dispute, the Determination
    shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and
    the Executive subject to the application of Paragraph 5(c)
    below.

                   (c)  As a result of the uncertainty in the
    application of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, it is
    possible that a Gross-Up Payment (or a portion thereof) will
    be paid which should not have been paid (an "Excess Payment")
    or a Gross-Up Payment (or a portion thereof) which should
    have been paid will not have been paid (an "Underpayment").
    An Underpayment shall be deemed to have occurred (i) upon
    notice (formal or informal) to the Executive from any
    governmental taxing authority that the Executive's tax
    liability (whether in respect of the Executive's current
    taxable year or in respect of any prior taxable year) may be
    increased by reason of the imposition of the Excise Tax on a
    Payment or Payments with respect to which the Company has
    failed to make a sufficient Gross-Up Payment, (ii) upon a
    determination by a court, (iii) by reason of determination by
    the Company (which shall include the position taken by the
    Company, together with its consolidated group, on its federal
    income tax return) or (iv) upon the resolution of the Dispute
    to the Executive's satisfaction.  If an Underpayment occurs,
    the Executive shall promptly notify the Company and the
    Company shall promptly, but in any event, at least five days
    prior to the date on which the applicable government taxing
    authority has requested payment, pay to the Executive an
    additional Gross-Up Payment equal to the amount of the
    Underpayment plus any interest and penalties (other than
    interest and penalties imposed by reason of the Executive's
    failure to file timely a tax return or pay taxes shown due on
    the Executive's return) imposed on the Underpayment.  An
    Excess Payment shall be deemed to have occurred upon a "Final
    Determination" (as hereinafter defined) that the Excise Tax
    shall not be imposed upon a Payment or Payments (or portion
    thereof) with respect to which the Executive had previously
    received a Gross-Up Payment.  A "Final Determination" shall
    be deemed to have occurred when the Executive has received
    from the applicable government taxing authority a refund of
    taxes or other reduction in the Executive's tax liability by
    reason of the Excise Payment and upon either (x) the date a
    determination is made by, or an agreement is entered into
    with, the applicable governmental taxing authority which
    finally and conclusively binds the Executive and such taxing
    authority, or in the event that a claim is brought before a
    court of competent jurisdiction, the date upon which a final
    determination has been made by such court and either all
    appeals have been taken and finally resolved or the time for
    all appeals has expired or (y) the statute of limitations
    with respect to the Executive's applicable tax return has
    expired.  If an Excess Payment is determined to have been
    made, the amount of the Excess Payment shall be treated as a
    loan by the Company to the Executive and the Executive shall
    pay to the Company on demand (but not less than 10 days after
    the determination of such Excess Payment and written notice
    has been delivered to the Executive) the amount of the Excess
    Payment plus interest at an annual rate equal to the
    Applicable Federal Rate provided for in Section 1274(d) of
    the Code from the date the Gross-Up Payment (to which the
    Excess Payment relates) was paid to the Executive until the
    date of repayment to the Company.

                   (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in
    this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that, according
    to the Determination, an Excise Tax will be imposed on any
    Payment or Payments, the Company shall pay to the applicable
    government taxing authorities as Excise Tax withholding, the
    amount of the Excise Tax that the Company has actually
    withheld from the Payment or Payments.

         6.  Successors; Binding Agreement.

                   (a)  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
    shall inure to the benefit of the Company, its Successors and
    Assigns and the Company shall require any Successor or Assign
    to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in
    the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would
    be required to perform it if no such succession or assignment
    had taken place.

                   (b)  Neither this Agreement nor any right or
    interest hereunder shall be assignable or transferable by the
    Executive, [his or her] beneficiaries or legal
    representatives, except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
    and be enforceable by the Executive's legal personal
    representative.

         7.  Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay all legal
    fees and related expenses (including the costs of experts,
    evidence and counsel) incurred by the Executive as they
    become due as a result of (a) the Executive's termination of
    employment (including all such fees and expenses, if any,
    incurred in contesting or disputing any such termination of
    employment), (b) the Executive seeking to obtain or enforce
    any right or benefit provided by this Agreement (including,
    but not limited to, any such fees and expenses incurred in
    connection with (i) the Dispute and (ii) the Gross-Up Payment
    whether as a result of any applicable government taxing
    authority proceeding, audit or otherwise) or by any other
    plan or arrangement maintained by the Company under which the
    Executive is or may be entitled to receive benefits, and (c)
    the Executive's hearing before the Board as contemplated in
    Section 2.4 of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
    circumstances set forth in clauses (a) and (b) (other than as
    a result of the Executive's termination of employment under
    circumstances described in Section 2.5(d)) occurred on or
    after a Change in Control.

         8.  Notice.  For the purposes of this Agreement, notices
    and all other communications provided for in the Agreement
    (including the Notice of Termination) shall be in writing and
    shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally
    delivered or sent by certified mail, return receipt
    requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective
    addresses last given by each party to the other, provided
    that all notices to the Company shall be directed to the
    attention of the Board with a copy to the Secretary of the
    Company.  All notices and communications shall be deemed to
    have been received on the date of delivery thereof or on the
    third business day after the mailing thereof, except that
    notice of change of address shall be effective only upon
    receipt.

         9.  Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Nothing in this
    Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing
    or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or
    other plan or program provided by the Company (except for any
    severance or termination policies, plans, programs or
    practices) and for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall
    anything herein limit or reduce such rights as the Executive
    may have under any other agreements with the Company (except
    for any severance or termination agreement).  Amounts which
    are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise
    entitled to receive under any plan or program of the Company
    shall be payable in accordance with such plan or program,
    except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

         10.  Settlement of Claims.  The Company's obligation to
    make the payments provided for in this Agreement and
    otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
    affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation,
    any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
    which the Company may have against the Executive or others.

         11.  Miscellaneous.  No provision of this Agreement may
    be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver,
    modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed
    by the Executive and the Company.  No waiver by either party
    hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto
    of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this
    Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed
    a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at
    the same or at any prior or subsequent time.  No agreement or
    representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with
    respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either
    party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.

         12.  Governing Law.  THE VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION,
    CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL IN ALL
    RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
    ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT GIVING
    EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF; PROVIDED,
    HOWEVER, THAT IN ANY ACTION INVOLVING THE EXECUTIVE AND THE
    COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OR ASSERTION THAT THE
    EXECUTIVE'S EMPLOYMENT WAS PROPERLY TERMINATED FOR CAUSE, THE
    COMPANY HAS THE BURDEN OF PROVING THAT THE EXECUTIVE'S
    EMPLOYMENT WAS PROPERLY TERMINATED FOR CAUSE.

         13.  Forum.  Any suit brought by the Executive under
    this Agreement may be brought in the appropriate state or
    federal court for Tarrant County, Texas, or for the county
    wherein the Executive maintains [his or her] residence.  Any

         14.  Severability.  The provisions of this Agreement
    shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or
    unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
    validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

         15.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the
    entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes
    all prior agreements, if any, understandings and

                    TERMINATION PROTECTION AGREEMENT
                        FOR DIVISION EXECUTIVES 


         THIS AGREEMENT made as of the day _______ of August,
    1990, by and between the "Company" (as hereinafter defined)
    and ________________ (the "Executive").

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the
    "Board") recognizes that the possibility of a "Change in
    Control" (as hereinafter defined) exists and that the threat
    or the occurrence of a Change in Control can result in
    significant distractions of its key management personnel
    because of the uncertainties inherent in such a situation;

         WHEREAS, the Board has determined that it is essential
    and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders
    to retain the services of the Executive in the event of a
    threat or occurrence of a Change in Control and to ensure
    [his or her] continued dedication and efforts in such event
    without undue concern for [his or her] personal financial and
    employment security; and

         WHEREAS, in order to induce the Executive to remain in
    the employ of the Company, particularly in the event of a
    threat or the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company
    desires to enter into this Agreement with the Executive to
    provide the Executive with certain benefits in the event [his
    or her] employment is terminated as a result of, or in
    connection with, a Change in Control and to provide the
    Executive with the "Gross-Up Payment" (as hereinafter
    defined) and certain other benefits whether or not the
    Executive's employment is terminated.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective
    agreements of the parties contained herein, it is agreed as
    follows:

         1.  Term of Agreement.  This Agreement shall commence as
    of August 22, 1990 and shall continue in effect until August
    22, 1992; provided, however, that commencing on August 22,
    1991 and on each August 22 thereafter, the term of this
    Agreement shall be automatically extended for one (1) year
    unless either the Company or the Executive shall have given
    written notice to the other at least ninety (90) days prior
    thereto that the term of this Agreement shall not be so
    extended; and provided, further, however, that
    notwithstanding any such notice by the Company not to extend,
    the term of this Agreement shall not expire prior to the
    expiration of twenty-four (24) months after the occurrence of
    a Change in Control.

         2.  Definitions.

              2.1.
    Accrued Compensation.  For purposes of this Agreement,
    "Accrued Compensation" shall mean an amount which shall
    include all amounts earned or accrued through the
    "Termination Date" (as hereinafter defined) but not paid as
    of the Termination Date including (i) base salary, and (ii)
    reimbursement for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred
    by the Executive on behalf of the Company during the period
    ending on the Termination Date, (iii) vacation pay, if
    required by applicable law and (iv) bonuses and incentive
    compensation (other than the "Pro Rata Bonus" (as hereinafter
    defined)).

              2.2.
    Base Amount.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Base Amount"
    shall mean the greater of the Executive's annual base salary
    (a) at the rate in effect on the Termination Date or (b) at
    the highest rate in effect at any time during the ninety (90)
    day period prior to the Change in Control, and shall include
    all amounts of [his or her] base salary that are deferred
    under the qualified and non-qualified employee benefit plans
    of the Company.

              2.3.
    Bonus Amount.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Bonus Amount"
    shall mean the highest annual bonus paid or payable to the
    Executive for any fiscal year in respect of the three (3)
    full fiscal years ended prior to the Change in Control.

              2.4.
    Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, a termination of
    employment is for "Cause" if the Executive has been convicted
    of a felony or the termination is evidenced by a resolution
    adopted in good faith by two-thirds of the Board that the
    Executive (a) intentionally and continually failed
    substantially to perform [his or her] reasonably assigned
    duties with the Company (other than a failure resulting from
    the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness
    or from the Executive's assignment of duties that would
    constitute "Good Reason" as hereinafter defined) which
    failure continued for a period of at least thirty (30) days
    after a written notice of demand for substantial performance
    has been delivered to the Executive specifying the manner in
    which the Executive has failed substantially to perform, or
    (b) intentionally engaged in conduct which is demonstrably
    and materially injurious to the Company; provided, however,
    that no termination of the Executive's employment shall be
    for Cause as set forth in clause (b) above until (x) there
    shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a
    written notice setting forth that the Executive was guilty of
    the conduct set forth in clause (b) and specifying the
    particulars thereof in detail, and (y) the Executive shall
    have been provided an opportunity to be heard in person by
    the Board (with the assistance of the Executive's counsel if
    the Executive so desires).  No act, nor failure to act, on
    the Executive's part, shall be considered "intentional"
    unless the Executive has acted, or failed to act, with a lack
    of good faith and with a lack of reasonable belief that the
    Executive's action or failure to act was in the best interest
    of the Company.

              2.5.
    Change in Control.  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change
    in Control" shall mean any of the following events:

               (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from
    the Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the
    "Voting Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person is
    used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"))
    immediately after which such Person has "Beneficial
    Ownership" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
    under the 1934 Act) of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
    combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
    Voting Securities; provided, however, that in determining
    whether a Change in Control has occurred, Voting Securities
    which are acquired in a "Non-Control Acquisition" (as
    hereinafter defined) shall not constitute an acquisition
    which would cause a Change in Control.  A "Non-Control
    Acquisition" shall mean an acquisition by (1) an employee
    benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained
    by (x) the Company or (y) any corporation or other Person of
    which a majority of its voting power or its equity securities
    or equity interest is owned directly or indirectly by the
    Company (a "Subsidiary"), (2) the Company or any Subsidiary,
    or (3) any Person in connection with a "Non-Control
    Transaction" (as hereinafter defined).

                   (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22,
    1990, are members of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease
    for any reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the
    Board; provided, however, that if the election, or nomination
    for election by the Company's stockholders, of any new
    director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
    Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of
    this Agreement, be considered as a member of the Incumbent
    Board; provided further, however, that no individual shall be
    considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
    initially asssumed office as a result of either an actual or
    threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11
    promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

                   (c)  Approval by stockholders of the Company
    of:

                        (1)  A merger, consolidation or
                   reorganization involving the Company, unless 

                        (i)  the stockholders of the
                        Company, immediately before such merger,
                        consolidation or reorganization, own,
                        directly or indirectly immediately
                        following such merger, consolidation or
                        reorganization, at least sixty percent
                        (60%) of the combined voting power of the
                        outstanding voting securities of the
                        corporation resulting from such merger or
                        consolidation or reorganization (the
                        "Surviving Corporation") in substantially
                        the same proportion as their ownership of
                        the Voting Securities immediately before
                        such merger, consolidation or
                        reorganization,

                        (ii)  the individuals who were members of
                        the Incumbent Board immediately prior to
                        the execution of the agreement providing
                        for such merger, consolidation or
                        reorganization constitute at least
                        two-thirds of the members of the boardof
                        directors of the Surviving Corporation,

                        (iii)  no Person (other than the Company,
                        any Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan
                        (or any trust forming a part thereof)
                        maintained by the Company, the Surviving
                        Corporation or any Subsidiary, or any
                        Person who, immediately prior to such
                        merger, consolidation or reorganization
                        had Beneficial Ownership of fifteen
                        percent (15%) or more of the then
                        outstanding Voting Securities) has
                        Beneficial Ownership of fifteen percent
                        (15%) or more of the combined voting
                        power of the Surviving Corporation's then
                        outstanding voting securities, and

                        (iv)  a transaction described in clauses
                        (i) through (iii) shall herein be
                        referred to as a "Non-Control
                        Transaction";

                        (2)  A complete liquidation or
                   dissolution of the Company; or

                        (3)  An agreement for the sale or other
                   disposition of all or substantially all of the
                   assets of the Company to any Person (other
                   than a transfer to a Subsidiary).

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not
    be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject
    Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the
    permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a
    result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company
    which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
    Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
    any additional Voting Securities which increases the
    percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in
    Control shall occur.

                   (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in
    this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive's employment
    is terminated following the Effective Date but within one (1)
    year prior to a Change in Control and [the Executive
    reasonably demonstrates that] such termination (i) was at the
    request of a third party who has indicated an intention or
    taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in
    Control and who effectuates a Change in Control (a "Third
    Party") or (ii) otherwise occurred in connection with, or in
    anticipation of, a Change in Control which actually occurs,
    then for all purposes of this Agreement, the date of a Change
    in Control with respect to the Executive shall mean the date
    immediately prior to the date of such termination of the
    Executive's employment.

              2.6.  Company.  For purposes of this Agreement, the
    "Company" shall mean Tandy Corporation and shall include its
    "Successors and Assigns" (as hereinafter defined).

              2.7.  Disability.  For purposes of this Agreement,
    "Disability" shall mean a physical or mental infirmity which
    impairs the Executive's ability to substantially perform [his
    or her] duties with the Company for a period of one hundred
    eighty (180) consecutive days and the Executive has not
    returned to [his or her] full time employment prior to the
    Termination Date as stated in the "Notice of Termination" (as
    hereinafter defined).

              2.8.  (a) Good Reason.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence after a
    Change in Control of any of the events or conditions
    described in Subsections (i) through (ix) hereof:

              (i)  a change in the Executive's status, title,
              position or responsibilities (including reporting
              responsibilities) which, in the Executive's
              reasonable judgment, represents an adverse change
              in [his or her] status, title, position or
              responsibilities as in effect at any time within
              ninety (90) days preceding the date of the Change
              in Control or at any time thereafter; the
              assignment to the Executive of any duties or
              responsibilities which, in the Executive's
              reasonable judgment, are inconsistent with such
              status, title, position or responsibilities as in
              effect at any time within ninety (90) days
              preceding the date of the Change in Control or at
              any time thereafter; or any removal of the
              Executive from or failure to reappoint or reelect
              [him or her] to any of [his or her] offices or
              positions, except in connection with the
              termination of the Executive's employment for
              Cause, or as a result of [his or her] death, or by
              the Executive other than for Good Reason;

              (ii)  a reduction in the rate of the Executive's
              base salary below the Base Amount or any failure to
              pay the Executive any compensation or benefits to
              which [he or she] is entitled within fifteen (15)
              days of the date notice of such failure is given to
              the Company and, in the case of any annual bonus,
              within forty-five (45) days following the end of
              the fiscal year pursuant to which such bonus
              relates;

              preceding the Change in Control or at any time
              thereafter which, in the Executive's reasonable
              judgment, results in a reduction in [his or her]
              earning potential;

              (iv)  the Company's requiring the Executive to be
              based at any place outside a 20-mile radius from
              [his or her] place of employment on the day prior
              to the Change in Control, except for reasonably
              required travel on the Company's business which is
              not materially greater than such travel
              requirements prior to the Change in Control;

              (v)  the failure by the Company to (A) continue in
              effect (without reduction in benefit levels, reward
              opportunities and/or bonus potential for comparable
              performance) any material compensation or benefit
              plan in which the Executive was participating at
              any time within ninety (90) days preceding the
              Change in Control or at any time thereafter
              including, but not limited to, the plans listed on
              Appendix A, unless such plan is replaced with a
              plan that provides substantially equivalent
              compensation or benefits to the Executive, or
              (B) provide the Executive with compensation and
              benefits, in the aggregate at least equal (in terms
              of benefit levels and/or reward opportunities) to
              those provided for under each other employee
              benefit plan, program and practice in which the
              Executive was participating at any time within
              ninety (90) days preceding the Change in Control or
              at any time thereafter;

              (vi)  the insolvency or the filing (by any party,
              including the Company) of a petition for
              bankruptcy, of the Company, which petition is not
              dismissed within sixty (60) days;

              (vii)  any material breach by the Company of any
              provision hereof;

              (viii)  any purported termination of the
              Executive's employment for Cause by the Company
              which does not comply with the terms of Section 2.4
              hereof; and

              (ix)  the failure of the Company to obtain an
              agreement, satisfactory to the Executive, from any
              Successor or Assign of the Company, to assume and
              agree to perform this Agreement, as contemplated in
              Section 6 hereof.

                   (b)  Any event or condition described in this
    Section 2.8(a)(i) through (ix) which occurs following the
    Effective Date but within one (1) year prior to a Change in
    Control but which the Executive reasonably demonstrates (i)
    was at the request of a Third Party or (ii) otherwise arose
    in connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in
    Control which actually occurs, shall constitute Good Reason
    for purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding that it
    occurred prior to the Change in Control.

              2.9.  Notice of Termination.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, following a Change in Control, "Notice of
    Termination" shall mean a written notice of termination from
    the Company of the Executive's employment which indicates the
    specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon
    and which sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and
    circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of
    the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.

              2.10.  Pro Rata Bonus.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Pro Rata Bonus" shall mean an amount equal to the
    Bonus Amount multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
    is the number of days in the fiscal year through the
    Termination Date and the denominator of which is 365.

              2.11.  Successors and Assigns.  For purposes of
    this Agreement, "Successors and Assigns" shall mean a
    corporation or other entity acquiring all or substantially
    all the assets and business of the Company (including this
    Agreement) whether by operation of law or otherwise.

              2.12.  Termination Date.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Termination Date" shall mean in the case of the
    Executive's death, [his or her] date of death, in the case of
    Good Reason, the last day of [his or her] employment, and in
    all other cases, the date specified in the Notice of
    Termination; provided, however, that if the Executive's
    employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or due to
    Disability, the date specified in the Notice of Termination
    shall be at least 30 days from the date the Notice of
    Termination is given to the Executive, provided that in the
    case of Disability the Executive shall not have returned to
    the full-time performance of [his or her] duties during such
    period of at least 30 days.

         3.  Termination of Employment.

              3.1.  If, during the term of this Agreement, the
    Executive's employment with the Company shall be terminated
    within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control,
    the Executive shall be entitled to the following compensation
    and benefits:

                   (a)  If the Executive's employment with the
    Company shall be terminated (1) by reason of the Executive's
    death, (2) by the Company for Cause or Disability, or (3) by
    the Executive other than for Good Reason and other than
    during the 60-day period commencing on the first anniversary
    of the date of the occurrence of a Change in Control (the
    "Window Period"), the Company shall pay to the Executive the
    Accrued Compensation and, if such termination is other than
    by the Company for Cause, a Pro Rata Bonus.

                   (b)  If the Executive's employment with the
    Company shall be terminated for any reason other than as
    specified in Section 3.1(a) or during the Window Period, the
    Executive shall be entitled to the following:

                   (i)  the Company shall pay the Executive all
    Accrued Compensation and a Pro-Rata Bonus;

                   (ii)  the Company shall pay the Executive as
    termination pay and in lieu of any further compensation for
    periods subsequent to the Termination Date, in a single
    payment an amount (the "Termination Amount") in cash equal to
    two times the sum of (A) the Base Amount and (B) the Bonus
    Amount;

                   (iii)  for twenty-four (24) months from the
    Termination Date (the "Continuation Period"), the Company
    shall at its expense continue on behalf of the Executive and
    [his or her] dependents and beneficiaries the fringe
    benefits, (excluding those benefit plans numbered 1 through 8
    inclusive on Appendix A but including an automobile or
    automobile allowance and the related expenses of public
    liability insurance, collision coverage, repairs and
    maintenance) and the life insurance, disability, medical,
    dental and hospitalization benefits provided (x) to the
    Executive at any time during the 90-day period prior to the
    Change in Control or at any time thereafter or (y) to other
    similarly situated executives who continue in the employ of
    the Company during the Continuation Period; provided,
    however, that with respect to any Executive who was entitled
    to the use of an automobile provided by the Company within
    the ninety (90) day period prior to a Change in Control or at
    any time thereafter, the Executive shall be paid a cash
    payment equal to the value of the Company provided automobile
    to the Executive for the Continuation Period.  The coverage
    and benefits (including deductibles and contributions by the
    Executive, if any) provided in this Section 3.1(b)(iii)
    during the Continuation Period shall be no less favorable to
    the Executive and [his or her] dependents and beneficiaries,
    than the most favorable of such coverages and benefits during
    any of the periods referred to in clauses (x) and (y) above. 
    The Company's obligation hereunder with respect to the
    foregoing benefits (except for the automobile or automobile
    allowance and the related expenses of public liability
    insurance, collision coverage, repairs and maintenance) shall
    be limited to the extent that the Executive obtains any such
    benefits pursuant to a subsequent employer's benefit plans,
    in which case the Company may reduce the coverage of any
    benefits it is required to provide the Executive hereunder as
    long as the aggregate coverages and benefits of the combined
    benefit plans is no less favorable to the Executive than the
    coverages and benefits required to be provided hereunder.
    This Subsection (iii) shall not be interpreted so as to limit
    any benefits to which the Executive, [his or her] dependents
    or beneficiaries may be entitled under any of the Company's
    employee benefit plans, programs or practices following the
    Executive's termination of employment, including without
    limitation, retiree medical and life insurance benefits;

                   (iv)  the Company shall pay in a single
    payment an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the
    maximum amount the Executive could have contributed under the
    Deferred Salary and Investment Plan, Stock Purchase Program
    and Supplemental Stock Program as in effect on the date
    immediately prior to the Change in Control during the
    Continuation Period had [he or she] continued in the
    employment with the Company during the Continuation Period
    the greater of [his or her] annualized gross salary and wages
    as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control or at
    any time thereafter; and

                   (v)  (A) the restrictions on any outstanding
    incentive awards (including restricted stock and granted
    performance shares or units) granted to the Executive
    including, but not limited to, awards granted under the
    Company's 1985 Stock Option Plan, or under any other
    incentive plan or arrangement shall lapse and such incentive
    award shall become 100% vested, all stock options and stock
    appreciation rights granted to the Executive shall become
    immediately exercisable and shall become 100% vested, and all
    performance units granted to the Executive shall become 100%
    vested and (B) the Executive shall have the right to require
    the Company to purchase, for cash, any shares of unrestricted
    stock or shares purchased upon exercise of any options, at a
    price equal to the fair market value of such shares on the
    date of purchase by the Company.

                   (c)  The amounts provided for in Sections
    3.1(a) and 3.1(b)(i), (ii), (iii) (only as to the automobile
    allowance and the related expenses of public liability
    insurance, collision coverage, repairs and maintenance) and
    (iv) shall be paid in a single lump sum cash payment within
    five (5) days after the Executive's Termination Date (or
    earlier, if required by applicable law).

                   (d)  The Executive shall not be required to
    mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this
    Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise and no
    such payment shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any
    compensation or benefits provided to the Executive in any
    subsequent employment except as provided in Section
    3.1(b)(iii).

              3.2.  (a)  The termination pay and termination
    benefits provided for in this Section 3 shall be in lieu of
    any other severance or termination pay to which the Executive
    may be entitled under any Company severance or termination
    plan, program, policy or practice.

                   (b)  The Executive's entitlement to any other
    compensation or benefits (other than the Pro Rata Bonus and
    other than the termination pay and termination benefits as
    provided under this Section 3) shall be determined in
    accordance with the Company's employee benefit plans
    (including, the plans listed on Appendix A) and other
    applicable programs, policies and practices then in effect.

              3.3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
    Agreement to the contrary, the termination of the Executive's
    employment with the Company in connection with the sale,
    divestiture or other disposition of a "Division" (as
    hereinafter defined) (or part thereof) shall not be deemed to
    be a termination of employment of the Executive for purposes
    of this Agreement provided the Executive is offered
    employment by the purchaser or acquiror of such Division (or
    part thereof) and the Company obtains an agreement from such
    purchaser or acquiror as contemplated in Section 6(c) and the
    Executive shall not be entitled to benefits from the Company
    under this Agreement as a result of such sale, divestiture,
    or other disposition, or as a result of any subsequent
    termination of employment.  "Division" shall mean [name of
    Division].

         4.  Notice of Termination.  Following a Change in
    Control, any purported termination of the Executive's
    employment by the Company shall be communicated by Notice of
    Termination to the Executive.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, no such purported termination shall be effective
    without such Notice of Termination.

         5.  Excise Tax Payments.

                   (a)  In the event that any payment or benefit
    (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), to the
    Executive or for [his or her] benefit paid or payable or
    distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this
    Agreement or otherwise in connection with, or arising out of,
    [his or her] employment with the Company or a change in
    ownership or effective control of the Company or of a
    substantial portion of its assets (a "Payment" or
    "Payments"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by
    Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are
    incurred by the Exeuctive with respect to such excise tax
    (such excise tax, together with any such interest and
    penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    "Excise Tax"), then the Executive will be entitled to receive
    an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount
    such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes
    (including any interest or penalties, other than interest and
    penalties imposed by reason of the Executive's failure to
    file timely a tax return or pay taxes shown due on [his or
    her] return, imposed with respect to such taxes and the
    Excise Tax), including any Excise Tax imposed upon the
    Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the
    Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the
    Payments.

                   (b)  An initial determination as to whether a
    Gross-Up Payment is required pursuant to this Agreement and
    the amount of such Gross-Up Payment shall be made at the
    Company's expense by an accounting firm selected by the
    Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive which is
    designated as one of the five largest accounting firms in the
    United States (the "Accounting Firm").  The Accounting Firm
    shall provide its determination (the "Determination"),
    together with detailed supporting calculations and
    documentation to the Company and the Executive within five
    days of the Termination Date if applicable, or such other
    time as requested by the Company or by the Executive
    (provided the Executive reasonably believes that any of the
    Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax) and if the
    Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by
    the Executive with respect to a Payment or Payments, it shall
    furnish the Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable
    to the Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with
    respect to any such Payment or Payments.  Within ten days of
    the delivery of the Determination to the Executive, the
    Executive shall have the right to dispute the Determination
    (the "Dispute").  The Gross-Up Payment, if any, as determined
    pursuant to this Paragraph 5(b) shall be paid by the Company
    to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the
    Accounting Firm's determination.  The existence of the
    Dispute shall not in any way affect the Executive's right to
    receive the Gross-Up Payment in accordance with the
    Determination.  If there is no Dispute, the Determination
    shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and
    the Executive subject to the application of Paragraph 5(c)
    below.

                   (c)  As a result of the uncertainty in the
    application of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, it is
    possible that a Gross-Up Payment (or a portion thereof) will
    be paid which should not have been paid (an "Excess Payment")
    or a Gross-Up Payment (or a portion thereof) which should
    have been paid will not have been paid (an "Underpayment").
    An Underpayment shall be deemed to have occurred (i) upon
    notice (formal or informal) to the Executive from any
    governmental taxing authority that the Executive's tax
    liability (whether in respect of the Executive's current
    taxable year or in respect of any prior taxable year) may be
    increased by reason of the imposition of the Excise Tax on a
    Payment or Payments with respect to which the Company has
    failed to make a sufficient Gross-Up Payment, (ii) upon a
    determination by a court, (iii) by reason of determination by
    the Company (which shall include the position taken by the
    Company, together with its consolidated group, on its federal
    income tax return) or (iv) upon the resolution of the Dispute
    to the Executive's satisfaction.  If an Underpayment occurs,
    the Executive shall promptly notify the Company and the
    Company shall promptly, but in any event, at least five days
    prior to the date on which the applicable government taxing
    authority has requested payment, pay to the Executive an
    additional Gross-Up Payment equal to the amount of the
    Underpayment plus any interest and penalties (other than
    interest and penalties imposed by reason of the Executive's
    failure to file timely a tax return or pay taxes shown due on
    the Executive's return) imposed on the Underpayment.  An
    Excess Payment shall be deemed to have occurred upon a "Final
    Determination" (as hereinafter defined) that the Excise Tax
    shall not be imposed upon a Payment or Payments (or portion
    thereof) with respect to which the Executive had previously
    received a Gross-Up Payment.  A "Final Determination" shall
    be deemed to have occurred when the Executive has received
    from the applicable government taxing authority a refund of
    taxes or other reduction in the Executive's tax liability by
    reason of the Excise Payment and upon either (x) the date a
    determination is made by, or an agreement is entered into
    with, the applicable governmental taxing authority which
    finally and conclusively binds the Executive and such taxing
    authority, or in the event that a claim is brought before a
    court of competent jurisdiction, the date upon which a final
    determination has been made by such court and either all
    appeals have been taken and finally resolved or the time for
    all appeals has expired or (y) the statute of limitations
    with respect to the Executive's applicable tax return has
    expired.  If an Excess Payment is determined to have been
    made, the amount of the Excess Payment shall be treated as a
    loan by the Company to the Executive and the Executive shall
    pay to the Company on demand (but not less than 10 days after
    the determination of such Excess Payment and written notice
    has been delivered to the Executive) the amount of the Excess
    Payment plus interest at an annual rate equal to the
    Applicable Federal Rate provided for in Section 1274(d) of
    the Code from the date the Gross-Up Payment (to which the
    Excess Payment relates) was paid to the Executive until the
    date of repayment to the Company.

                   (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in
    this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that, according
    to the Determination, an Excise Tax will be imposed on any
    Payment or Payments, the Company shall pay to the applicable
    government taxing authorities as Excise Tax withholding, the
    amount of the Excise Tax that the Company has actually
    withheld from the Payment or Payments.

         6.  Successors; Binding Agreement.

                   (a)  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
    shall inure to the benefit of the Company and its Successors
    and Assigns and the Company shall require any Successor or
    Assign to expressly assume and agree to perform this
    Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the
    Company would be required to perform it if no such succession
    or assignment had taken place.

                   (b)  Neither this Agreement nor any right or
    interest hereunder shall be assignable or transferable by the
    Executive, [his or her] beneficiaries or legal
    representatives, except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
    and be enforceable by the Executive's legal personal
    representative.

                   (c)  In the event that the Division (or part
    thereof) is sold, divested, or otherwise disposed of by the
    Company subsequent to a Change in Control and the Executive
    is offered employment by the purchaser or acquiror thereof,
    the Company shall require such purchaser or acquiror to
    assume, and agree to perform the Company's obligations under
    this Agreement, in the same manner, and to the same extent
    that the Company would be required to perform if no such
    acquisition or purchase had taken place.

         7.  Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay all legal
    fees and related expenses (including the costs of experts,
    evidence and counsel) incurred by the Executive as they
    become due as a result of (a) the Executive's termination of
    employment (including all such fees and expenses, if any,
    incurred in contesting or disputing any such termination of
    employment), (b) the Executive seeking to obtain or enforce
    any right or benefit provided by this Agreement (including,
    but not limited to, any such fees and expenses incurred in
    connection with (i) the Dispute and (ii) the Gross-Up Payment
    whether as a result of any applicable government taxing
    authority proceeding, audit or otherwise) or by any other
    plan or arrangement maintained by the Company under which the
    Executive is or may be entitled to receive benefits, and (c)
    the Executive's hearing before the Board as contemplated in
    Section 2.4 of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
    circumstances set forth in clauses (a) and (b) (other than as
    a result of the Executive's termination of employment under
    circumstances described in Section 2.5(d)) occurred on or
    after a Change in Control.

         8.  Notice.  For the purposes of this Agreement, notices
    and all other communications provided for in the Agreement
    (including the Notice of Termination) shall be in writing and
    shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally
    delivered or sent by certified mail, return receipt
    requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective
    addresses last given by each party to the other, provided
    that all notices to the Company shall be directed to the
    attention of the Board with a copy to the Secretary of the
    Company.  All notices and communications shall be deemed to
    have been received on the date of delivery thereof or on the
    third business day after the mailing thereof, except that
    notice of change of address shall be effective only upon
    receipt.

         9.  Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Nothing in this
    Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing
    or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or
    other plan or program provided by the Company (except for any
    severance or termination policies, plans, programs or
    practices) and for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall
    anything herein limit or reduce such rights as the Executive
    may have under any other agreements with the Company (except
    for any severance or termination agreement).  Amounts which
    are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise
    entitled to receive under any plan or program of the Company
    shall be payable in accordance with such plan or program,
    except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

         10.  Settlement of Claims.  The Company's obligation to
    make the payments provided for in this Agreement and
    otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
    affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation,
    any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
    which the Company may have against the Executive or others.

         11.  Miscellaneous.  No provision of this Agreement may
    be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver,
    modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed
    by the Executive and the Company.  No waiver by either party
    hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto
    of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this
    Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed
    a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at
    the same or at any prior or subsequent time.  No agreement or
    representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with
    respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either
    party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.

         12.  Governing Law.  THE VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION,
    CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL IN ALL
    RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
    ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT GIVING

    HOWEVER, THAT IN ANY ACTION INVOLVING THE EXECUTIVE AND THE
    COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OR ASSERTION THAT THE
    EXECUTIVE'S EMPLOYMENT WAS PROPERLY TERMINATED FOR CAUSE, THE
    COMPANY HAS THE BURDEN OF PROVING THAT THE EXECUTIVE'S
    EMPLOYMENT WAS PROPERLY TERMINATED FOR CAUSE.

         13.  Forum.  Any suit brought by the Executive under
    this Agreement may be brought in the appropriate state or
    federal court for Tarrant County, Texas, or for the county
    wherein the Executive maintains [his or her] residence.  Any

         14.  Severability.  The provisions of this Agreement
    shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or
    unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
    validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

         15.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the
    entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes

                     TERMINATION PROTECTION AGREEMENT
                        FOR SUBSIDIARY EXECUTIVES


         THIS AGREEMENT made as of the day of August, 1990, by
    and among the "Company" (as hereinafter defined) the
    "Employer" (as hereinafter defined) and (the "Executive").

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the
    "Board") recognizes that the possibility of a "Change in
    Control" (as hereinafter defined) exists and that the threat
    or the occurrence of a Change in Control can result in
    significant distractions of its key management personnel
    because of the uncertainties inherent in such a situation;

         WHEREAS, the Board has determined that it is essential
    and in the best interest of the Company, its stockholders and
    the Employer to retain the services of the Executive in the
    event of a threat or occurrence of a Change in Control and to
    ensure [his or her] continued dedication and efforts in such
    event without undue concern for [his or her] personal
    financial and employment security; and

         WHEREAS, in order to induce the Executive to remain in
    the employ of the Employer, particularly in the event of a
    threat or the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company
    and the Employer desire to enter into this Agreement with the
    Executive to provide the Executive with certain benefits in
    the event [his or her] employment is terminated as a result
    of, or in connection with, a Change in Control and to provide
    the Executive with the "Gross-Up Payment" (as hereinafter
    defined) and certain other benefits whether or not the
    Executive's employment is terminated.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective
    agreements of the parties contained herein, it is agreed as
    follows:

         1.  Term of Agreement.  This Agreement shall commence as
    of August 22, 1990 and shall continue in effect until August
    22, 1992; provided, however, that commencing on August 22,
    1991 and on each August 22 thereafter, the term of this
    Agreement shall be automatically extended for one (1) year
    unless either the Company or the Executive shall have given
    written notice to the other at least ninety (90) days prior
    thereto that the term of this Agreement shall not be so
    extended; and provided, further, however, that
    notwithstanding any such notice by the Company not to extend,
    the term of this Agreement shall not expire prior to the
    expiration of twenty-four (24) months after the occurrence of
    a Change in Control.

         2.  Definitions.

              2.1.
    Accrued Compensation.  For purposes of this Agreement,
    "Accrued Compensation" shall mean an amount which shall
    include all amounts earned or accrued through the
    "Termination Date" (as hereinafter defined) but not paid as
    of the Termination Date including (i) base salary, and (ii)
    reimbursement for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred
    by the Executive on behalf of the Employer during the period
    ending on the Termination Date, (iii) vacation pay, if
    required by applicable law, and (iv) bonuses and incentive
    compensation (other than the "Pro Rata Bonus" (as hereinafter
    defined))].

              2.2.
    Base Amount.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Base Amount"
    shall mean the greater of the Executive's annual base salary
    (a) at the rate in effect on the Termination Date or (b) at
    the highest rate in effect at any time during the ninety (90)
    day period prior to the Change in Control, and shall include
    all amounts of [his or her] base salary that are deferred
    under the qualified and non-qualified employee benefit plans
    of the Company and/or the Employer.

              2.3.
    Bonus Amount.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Bonus Amount"
    shall mean the highest annual bonus paid or payable to the
    Executive for any fiscal year in respect of the three (3)
    full fiscal years ended prior to the Change in Control.

              2.4.
    Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement, a termination of
    employment is for "Cause" if the Executive has been convicted
    of a felony or the termination is evidenced by a resolution
    adopted in good faith by two-thirds of the Board that the
    Executive (a) intentionally and continually failed
    substantially to perform [his or her] reasonably assigned
    duties with the Employer (other than a failure resulting from
    the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness
    or from the Executive's assignment of duties that would
    constitute "Good Reason" as hereinafter defined) which
    failure continued for a period of at least thirty (30) days
    after a written notice of demand for substantial performance
    has been delivered to the Executive specifying the manner in
    which the Executive has failed substantially to perform, or
    (b) intentionally engaged in conduct which is demonstrably
    and materially injurious to the Company and/or the Employer;
    provided, however, that no termination of the Executive's
    employment shall be for Cause as set forth in clause (b)
    above until (x) there shall have been delivered to the
    Executive a copy of a written notice setting forth that the
    Executive was guilty of the conduct set forth in clause (b)
    and specifying the particulars thereof in detail, and (y) the
    Executive shall have been provided an opportunity to be heard
    in person by the Board (with the assistance of the
    Executive's counsel if the Executive so desires).  No act,
    nor failure to act, on the Executive's part, shall be
    considered "intentional" unless the Executive has acted, or
    failed to act, with a lack of good faith and with a lack of
    reasonable belief that the Executive's action or failure to
    act was in the best interest of the Company and/or the
    Employer.

              2.5.

    Change in Control.  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change
    in Control" shall mean any of the following events:

              (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from the
    Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting
    Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person is used for
    purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) immediately after
    which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
    meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided,
    however, that in determining whether a Change in Control has
    occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a
    "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
    constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in
    Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an
    acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a trust
    forming a part thereof) maintained by (x) the Company or (y)
    any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its
    voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is
    owned directly or indirectly by the Company (a "Subsidiary"),
    (2) the Company or any Subsidiary, or (3) any Person in
    connection with a "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter
    defined).

              (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990,
    are members of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for
    any reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the Board;
    provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for
    election by the Company's stockholders, of any new director
    was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
    Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of
    this Agreement, be considered as a member of the Incumbent
    Board; provided further, however, that no individual shall be
    considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
    initially asssumed office as a result of either an actual or
    threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11
    promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

              (c)  Approval by stockholders of the Company of:

                   (1)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization
          involving the Company, unless

                   (i)  the stockholders of the Company,
                   immediately before such merger, consolidation
                   or reorganization, own, directly or indirectly
                   immediately following such merger,
                   consolidation or reorganization, at least
                   sixty percent (60%) of the combined voting
                   power of the outstanding voting securities of
                   the corporation resulting from such merger or
                   consolidation or reorganization (the
                   "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the
                   same proportion as their ownership of the
                   Voting Securities immediately before such
                   merger, consolidation or reorganization,

                   (ii)  the individuals who were members of the
                   Incumbent Board immediately prior to the
                   execution of the agreement providing for such
                   merger, consolidation or reorganization
                   constitute at least two-thirds of the members
                   of the board of directors of the Surviving
                   Corporation,

                   (iii)  no Person (other than the Company, any
                   Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan (or any
                   trust forming a part thereof) maintained by
                   the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
                   Subsidiary, or any Person who, immediately
                   prior to such merger, consolidation or
                   reorganization had Beneficial Ownership of
                   fifteen percent (15%) or more of the then
                   outstanding Voting Securities) has Beneficial
                   Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of
                   the combined voting power of the Surviving
                   Corporation's then outstanding voting
                   securities, and

                   (iv)  a transaction described in clauses (i)
                   through (iii) shall herein be referred to as a
                   "Non-Control Transaction";

                   (2) A complete liquidation or dissolution of
              the Company; or

                   (3)  An agreement for the sale or other
              disposition of all or substantially all of the
              assets of the Company to any Person (other than a
              transfer to a Subsidiary).

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not
    be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject
    Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the
    permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a
    result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company
    which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
    Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
    any additional Voting Securities which increases the
    percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in
    Control shall occur.

                   (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in
    this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive's employment
    is terminated following the Effective Date but within one (1)
    year prior to a Change in Control and [the Executive
    reasonably demonstrates that] such termination (i) was at the
    request of a third party who has indicated an intention or
    taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in
    Control and who effectuates a Change in Control (a "Third
    Party") or (ii) otherwise occurred in connection with, or in
    anticipation of, a Change in Control which actually occurs,
    then for all purposes of this Agreement, the date of a Change
    in Control with respect to the Executive shall mean the date
    immediately prior to the date of such termination of the
    Executive's employment.

              2.6.  Company.  For purposes of this Agreement, the
    "Company" shall mean Tandy Corporation and shall include its
    "Successors and Assigns" (as hereinafter defined).

              2.7.  Disability.  For purposes of this Agreement,
    "Disability" shall mean a physical or mental infirmity which
    impairs the Executive's ability to substantially perform [his
    or her] duties with the Employer for a period of one hundred
    eighty (180) consecutive days and the Executive has not
    returned to [his or her] full time employment prior to the
    Termination Date as stated in the "Notice of Termination" (as
    hereinafter defined).

              2.8.  Employer.  For purposes of this Agreement,
    "Employer" shall mean [name of subsidiary].

              2.9.  (a) Good Reason.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean the occurrence after a
    Change in Control of any of the events or conditions
    described in Subsections (i) through (ix) hereof:

                   (i)  a change in the Executive's status,
                   title, position or responsibilities (including
                   reporting responsibilities) which, in the
                   Executive's reasonable judgment, represents an
                   adverse change in [his or her] status, title,
                   position or responsibilities as in effect at
                   any time within ninety (90) days preceding the
                   date of the Change in Control or at any time
                   thereafter; the assignment to the Executive of
                   any duties or responsibilities which, in the
                   Executive's reasonable judgment, are
                   inconsistent with such status, title, position
                   or responsibilities as in effect at any time
                   within ninety (90) days preceding the date of
                   the Change in Control or at any time
                   thereafter; or any removal of the Executive

                   termination of the Executive's employment for
                   Cause, or as a result of [his or her] death,

                   compensation or benefits to which [he or she]
                   is entitled within fifteen (15) days of the

                   within forty-five (45) days following the end
                   of the fiscal year pursuant to which such
                   bonus relates;

                   (iii)  a change in the accounting policies or
                   practices as in effect during the ninety (90)
                   days preceding the Change in Control or at any
                   time thereafter which, in the Executive's
                   reasonable judgment, results in a reduction in
                   [his or her] earning potential;

                   (iv)  the Employer's requiring the Executive
                   to be based at any place outside a 20-mile

                   except for reasonably required travel on the
                   Employer's business which is not materially
                   greater than such travel requirements prior to
                   the Change in Control;

                   (v)  the failure by the Company and/or the

                   reduction in benefit levels, reward
                   opportunities and/or bonus potential for
                   comparable performance) any material
                   compensation or benefit plan in which
                   the Executive was participating at any time
                   within ninety (90) days preceding the Change
                   in Control or at any time thereafter
                   including, but not limited to, the plans
                   listed on Appendix A, unless such plan is

                   and/or the Employer of any provision hereof;

                   (viii)  any purported termination of the
                   Executive's employment for Cause by the

                   comply with the terms of Section 2.4 hereof;
                   and

                   (ix)  the failure of the Company and the
                   Employer to obtain an agreement, satisfactory
                   to the Executive, from any Successor or Assign
                   of the Company, to assume and agree to perform
                   this Agreement, as contemplated in Section 6
                   hereof.

                        (b)  Any event or condition described in
    this Section 2.10(a)(i) through (ix) which occurs following
    the Effective Date but within one (1) year prior to a Change
    in Control but which the Executive reasonably demonstrates
    (i) was at the request of a Third Party or (ii) otherwise
    arose in connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in
    Control which actually occurs, shall constitute Good Reason
    for purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding that it
    occurred prior to the Change in Control.

              2.10.  Notice of Termination.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, following a Change in Control, "Notice of
    Termination" shall mean a written notice of termination from
    the Employer of the Executive's employment which indicates
    the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied
    upon and which sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and
    circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of
    the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated.

              2.11.  Pro Rata Bonus.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Pro Rata Bonus" shall mean an amount equal to the
    Bonus Amount multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
    is the number of days in the fiscal year through the
    Termination Date and the denominator of which is 365.

              2.12.  Successors and Assigns.  For purposes of
    this Agreement, "Successors and Assigns" shall mean a
    corporation or other entity acquiring all or substantially
    all the assets and business of the Company (including this
    Agreement) whether by operation of law or otherwise.

              2.13.  Termination Date.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, "Termination Date" shall mean in the case of the
    Executive's death, [his or her] date of death, in the case of
    Good Reason, the last day of [his or her] employment, and in
    all other cases, the date specified in the Notice of
    Termination; provided, however, that if the Executive's
    employment is terminated by the Employer for Cause or due to
    Disability, the date specified in the Notice of Termination
    shall be at least 30 days from the date the Notice of
    Termination is given to the Executive, provided that in the
    case of Disability the Executive shall not have returned to
    the full-time performance of [his or her] duties during such
    period of at least 30 days.

         3.  Termination of Employment.

              3.1.  If, during the term of this Agreement, the
    Executive's employment with the Employer shall be terminated
    within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control,
    the Executive shall be entitled to the following compensation
    and benefits:

                   (a)  If the Executive's employment with the
    Employer shall be terminated (1) by reason of the Executive's
    death, (2) by the Company for Cause or Disability, or (3) by
    the Executive other than for Good Reason and other than
    during the 60-day period commencing on the first anniversary
    of the date of the occurrence of a Change in Control (the
    "Window Period"), the Company shall pay to the Executive the
    Accrued Compensation and, if such termination is other than
    by the Employer for Cause, a Pro Rata Bonus.

                   (b)  If the Executive's employment with the
    Employer shall be terminated for any reason other than as
    specified in Section 3.1(a) or during the Window Period, the
    Executive shall be entitled to the following:

                   (i)  the Company shall pay the Executive all
    Accrued Compensation and a Pro-Rata Bonus;

                   (ii)  the Company shall pay the Executive as
    termination pay and in lieu of any further compensation for
    periods subsequent to the Termination Date, in a single
    payment an amount (the "Termination Amount") in cash equal to
    two times the sum of (A) the Base Amount and (B) the Bonus
    Amount;

                   (iii)  for twenty-four (24) months from the
    Termination Date (the "Continuation Period"), the Company
    shall at its expense continue on behalf of the Executive and
    [his or her] dependents and beneficiaries the fringe
    benefits, (excluding those benefit plans numbered 1 through 8
    inclusive on Appendix A but including an automobile or
    automobile allowance and the related expenses of public
    liability insurance, collision coverage, repairs and
    maintenance) and the life insurance, disability, medical,
    dental and hospitalization benefits provided (x) to the
    Executive at any time during the 90-day period prior to the
    Change in Control or at any time thereafter or (y) to other
    similarly situated executives who continue in the employ of
    the Company and/or the Employer during the Continuation
    Period; provided, however, that with respect to any Executive
    who was entitled to the use of an automobile provided by the
    Company and/or the Employer within the ninety (90) day period
    prior to a Change in Control or at any time thereafter, the
    Executive shall be paid a cash payment equal to the value of
    the Company and/or the Employer provided automobile to the
    Executive for the Continuation Period.  The coverage and
    benefits (including deductibles and contributions by the
    Executive, if any) provided in this Section 3.1(b)(iii)
    during the Continuation Period shall be no less favorable to
    the Executive and [his or her] dependents and beneficiaries,
    than the most favorable of such coverages and benefits during
    any of the periods referred to in clauses (x) and (y) above. 
    The Company's and/or the Employer's obligation hereunder with
    respect to the foregoing benefits (except for the automobile
    or automobile allowance and the related expenses of public
    liability insurance, collision coverage, repairs and
    maintenance) shall be limited to the extent that the
    Executive obtains any such benefits pursuant to a subsequent
    employer's benefit plans, in which case the Company and/or
    the Employer may reduce the coverage of any benefits it is
    required to provide the Executive hereunder as long as the
    aggregate coverages and benefits of the combined benefit
    plans is no less favorable to the Executive than the
    coverages and benefits required to be provided hereunder.
    This Subsection (iii) shall not be interpreted so as to limit
    any benefits to which the Executive, [his or her] dependents
    or beneficiaries may be entitled under any of the Company's
    and/or the Employer's employee benefit plans, programs or
    practices following the Executive's termination of
    employment, including without limitation, retiree medical and
    life insurance benefits;

                   (iv)  the Company shall pay in a single
    payment an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the
    maximum amount the Executive could have contributed under the
    Deferred Salary and Investment Plan, Stock Purchase Program
    and Supplemental Stock Program as in effect on the date
    immediately prior to the Change in Control during the
    Continuation Period had [he or she] continued in the
    employment with the Employer during the Continuation Period
    at the greater of [his or her] annualized gross salary and
    wages as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control
    or at any time thereafter; and

                   (v)  (A) the restrictions on any outstanding
    incentive awards (including restricted stock and granted
    performance shares or units) granted to the Executive
    including, but not limited to, awards granted under the
    Company's 1985 Stock Option Plan, or under any other
    incentive plan or arrangement shall lapse and such incentive
    award shall become 100% vested, all stock options and stock
    appreciation rights granted to the Executive shall become
    immediately exercisable and shall become 100% vested, and all
    performance units granted to the Executive shall become 100%
    vested and (B) the Executive shall have the right to require
    the Company to purchase, for cash, any shares of unrestricted
    stock or shares purchased upon exercise of any options, at a
    price equal to the fair market value of such shares on the
    date of purchase by the Company.

                   (c)  The amounts provided for in Sections
    3.1(a) and 3.1(b)(i), (ii), (iii) (only as to the automobile
    allowance and the related expenses of public liability
    insurance, collision coverage, repairs and maintenance) and
    (iv) shall be paid in a single lump sum cash payment within
    five (5) days after the Executive's Termination Date (or
    earlier, if required by applicable law).

                   (d)  The Executive shall not be required to
    mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this
    Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise and no
    such payment shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any
    compensation or benefits provided to the Executive in any
    subsequent employment except as provided in Section
    3.1(b)(iii).

              3.2.  (a)  The termination pay and termination
    benefits provided for in this Section 3 shall be in lieu of
    any other severance or termination pay to which the Executive
    may be entitled under any Company and/or Employer severance
    or termination plan, program, policy or practice.

                   (b)  The Executive's entitlement to any other
    compensation benefits (other than the Pro Rata Bonus and
    other than the termination pay and termination benefits as
    provided in this Section 3) shall be determined in accordance
    with the Company's and/or the Employer's employee benefit
    plans (including, the plans listed on Appendix A) and other
    applicable programs, policies and practices then in effect.

              3.3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
    Agreement to the contrary, the termination of the Executive's
    employment with the Employer in connection with the sale,
    divestiture or other disposition of the Employer (or part
    thereof) shall not be deemed to be a termination of
    employment of the Executive for purposes of this Agreement
    provided the Executive is offered employment by the purchaser
    or acquiror of the Employer (or part thereof) and the Company
    and the Employer obtain an agreement from such purchaser or
    acquiror as contemplated in Section 6(c) and the Executive
    shall not be entitled to benefits from the Company under this
    Agreement as a result of such sale, divestiture, or other
    disposition, or as a result of any subsequent termination of
    employment.

         4.  Notice of Termination.  Following a Change in
    Control, any purported termination of the Executive's
    employment by the Employer shall be communicated by Notice of
    Termination to the Executive.  For purposes of this
    Agreement, no such purported termination shall be effective
    without such Notice of Termination.

         5.  Excise Tax Payments.

                   (a)  In the event that any payment or benefit
    (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), to the
    Executive or for [his or her] benefit paid or payable or
    distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this
    Agreement or otherwise in connection with, or arising out of,
    [his or her] employment with the Employer or a change in
    ownership or effective control of the Company or of a
    substantial portion of its assets (a "Payment" or
    "Payments"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by
    Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are
    incurred by the Exeuctive with respect to such excise tax
    (such excise tax, together with any such interest and
    penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    "Excise Tax"), then the Executive will be entitled to receive
    an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount
    such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes
    (including any interest or penalties, other than interest and
    penalties imposed by reason of the Executive's failure to
    file timely a tax return or pay taxes shown due on [his or
    her] return, imposed with respect to such taxes and the
    Excise Tax), including any Excise Tax imposed upon the
    Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the
    Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the
    Payments.

                   (b)  An initial determination as to whether a
    Gross-Up Payment is required pursuant to this Agreement and
    the amount of such Gross-Up Payment shall be made at the
    Company's expense by an accounting firm selected by the
    Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive which is
    designated as one of the five largest accounting firms in the
    United States (the "Accounting Firm").  The Accounting Firm
    shall provide its determination (the "Determination"),
    together with detailed supporting calculations and
    documentation to the Company and the Executive within five
    days of the Termination Date if applicable, or such other
    time as requested by the Company or by the Executive
    (provided the Executive reasonably believes that any of the
    Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax) and if the
    Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by
    the Executive with respect to a Payment or Payments, it shall
    furnish the Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable
    to the Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with
    respect to any such Payment or Payments.  Within ten days of
    the delivery of the Determination to the Executive, the
    Executive shall have the right to dispute the Determination
    (the "Dispute").  The Gross-Up Payment, if any, as determined
    pursuant to this Paragraph 5(b) shall be paid by the Company
    to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the
    Accounting Firm's determination.  The existence of the
    Dispute shall not in any way affect the Executive's right to
    receive the Gross-Up Payment in accordance with the
    Determination.  If there is no Dispute, the Determination
    shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and
    the Executive subject to the application of Paragraph 5(c)
    below.

                   (c)  As a result of the uncertainty in the
    application of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, it is
    possible that a Gross-Up Payment (or a portion thereof) will
    be paid which should not have been paid (an "Excess Payment")
    or a Gross-Up Payment (or a portion thereof) which should
    have been paid will not have been paid (an "Underpayment"). 
    An Underpayment shall be deemed to have occurred (i) upon
    notice (formal or informal) to the Executive from any
    governmental taxing authority that the Executive's tax
    liability (whether in respect of the Executive's current
    taxable year or in respect of any prior taxable year) may be
    increased by reason of the imposition of the Excise Tax on a
    Payment or Payments with respect to which the Company has
    failed to make a sufficient Gross-Up Payment, (ii) upon a
    determination by a court, (iii) by reason of determination by
    the Company (which shall include the position taken by the
    Company, together with its consolidated group, on its federal
    income tax return) or (iv) upon the resolution of the Dispute
    to the Executive's satisfaction.  If an Underpayment occurs,
    the Executive shall promptly notify the Company and the
    Company shall promptly, but in any event, at least five days
    prior to the date on which the applicable government taxing
    authority has requested payment, pay to the Executive an
    additional Gross-Up Payment equal to the amount of the
    Underpayment plus any interest and penalties (other than
    interest and penalties imposed by reason of the Executive's
    failure to file timely a tax return or pay taxes shown due on
    the Executive's return) imposed on the Underpayment.  An
    Excess Payment shall be deemed to have occurred upon a "Final
    Determination" (as hereinafter defined) that the Excise Tax
    shall not be imposed upon a Payment or Payments (or portion
    thereof) with respect to which the Executive had previously
    received a Gross-Up Payment.  A "Final Determination" shall
    be deemed to have occurred when the Executive has received
    from the applicable government taxing authority a refund of
    taxes or other reduction in the Executive's tax liability by
    reason of the Excise Payment and upon either (x) the date a
    determination is made by, or an agreement is entered into
    with, the applicable governmental taxing authority which
    finally and conclusively binds the Executive and such taxing
    authority, or in the event that a claim is brought before a
    court of competent jurisdiction, the date upon which a final
    determination has been made by such court and either all
    appeals have been taken and finally resolved or the time for
    all appeals has expired or (y) the statute of limitations
    with respect to the Executive's applicable tax return has
    expired.  If an Excess Payment is determined to have been
    made, the amount of the Excess Payment shall be treated as a
    loan by the Company to the Executive and the Executive shall
    pay to the Company on demand (but not less than 10 days after
    the determination of such Excess Payment and written notice
    has been delivered to the Executive) the amount of the Excess
    Payment plus interest at an annual rate equal to the
    Applicable Federal Rate provided for in Section 1274(d) of
    the Code from the date the Gross-Up Payment (to which the
    Excess Payment relates) was paid to the Executive until the
    date of repayment to the Company.

                   (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in
    this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that, according
    to the Determination, an Excise Tax will be imposed on any
    Payment or Payments, the Company shall pay to the applicable
    government taxing authorities as Excise Tax withholding, the
    amount of the Excise Tax that the Company has actually
    withheld from the Payment or Payments.

         6.  Successors; Binding Agreement.

                   (a)  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
    shall inure to the benefit of the Company, its Successors and
    Assigns and the Employer and the Company shall require any
    Successor or Assign to expressly assume and agree to perform
    this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that
    the Company and/or the Employer would be required to perform
    it if no such succession or assignment had taken place.

                   (b)  Neither this Agreement nor any right or
    interest hereunder shall be assignable or transferable by the
    Executive, [his or her] beneficiaries or legal
    representatives, except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
    and be enforceable by the Executive's legal personal
    representative.

                   (c)  In the event that the Employer (or part
    thereof) is sold, divested, or otherwise disposed of by the
    Company subsequent to a Change in Control and the Executive
    is offered employment by the purchaser or acquiror thereof,
    the Company shall require such purchaser or acquiror to
    assume, and agree to perform the Company's and the Employer's
    obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner, and to
    the same extent that the Company and the Employer would be
    required to perform if no such acquisition or purchase had
    taken place.

         7.  Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay all legal
    fees and related expenses (including the costs of experts,
    evidence and counsel) incurred by the Executive as they
    become due as a result of (a) the Executive's termination of
    employment (including all such fees and expenses, if any,
    incurred in contesting or disputing any such termination of
    employment), (b) the Executive seeking to obtain or enforce
    any right or benefit provided by this Agreement (including,
    but not limited to, any such fees and expenses incurred in
    connection with (i) the Dispute and (ii) the Gross-Up Payment
    whether as a result of any applicable government taxing
    authority proceeding, audit or otherwise) or by any other
    plan or arrangement maintained by the Company and/or the
    Employer under which the Executive is or may be entitled to
    receive benefits, and (c) the Executive's hearing before the
    Board as contemplated in Section 2.4 of this Agreement;
    provided, however, that the circumstances set forth in
    clauses (a) and (b) (other than as a result of the
    Executive's termination of employment under circumstances
    described in Section 2.5(d)) occurred on or after a Change in
    Control.

         8.  Notice.  For the purposes of this Agreement, notices

    conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No
    agreement or representations, oral or otherwise, express or
    implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been

                         TANDY CORPORATION
                    TERMINATION PROTECTION PLAN

                             "LEVEL I"

         WHEREAS, the "Board" of the "Company" (as those terms
    are hereinafter defined) recognizes that the possibility of a
    future "Change in Control" (as hereinafter defined) exists
    and that the threat or occurrence of a Change in Control
    could result in significant distractions to its employees
    because of the uncertainties inherent in such a situation;
    and

         WHEREAS, the Board has determined that it is essential
    and in the best interest of the Company, its stockholders and
    the Employer to retain the services of certain of its
    employees in the event of a threat or the occurence of a
    Change in Control of the Company and to ensure their
    continued dedication and efforts in such event without undue
    concern for their employment and personal financial security.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in order to fulfill these purposes, the
    following is hereby adopted.


                             ARTICLE I

                        ESTABLISHMENT OF PLAN

         1.0  As of the Effective Date, the Company hereby
    establishes the Tandy Corporation Termination Protection Plan
    Level I (the "Plan") as set forth in this document.


                             ARTICLE II

                             DEFINITIONS

         As used herein the following words and phrases shall
    have the following respective meanings for purposes of the
    Plan unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

         2.1  Accrued Compensation.  "Accrued Compensation" shall
    mean an amount which shall include all amounts earned or
    accrued through the "Termination Date" (as hereinafter
    defined) but not paid as of the Termination Date including
    (i) base salary, (ii) reimbursement for reasonable and
    necessary expenses incurred by the "Participant" (as
    hereinafter defined) on behalf of the Employer during the
    period ending on the Termination Date, (iii) vacation pay as
    required by law, and (iv) bonuses and incentive compensation
    (other than the "Pro Rata Bonus" (as hereinafter defined)).

         2.2  Base Amount.  "Base Amount" shall mean the greater
    of the Participant's annual base salary (a) at the rate in
    effect on the Termination Date or (b) at the highest rate in
    effect at any time during the ninety (90) day period prior to
    the Change in Control, and shall include all amounts of the
    Participant's base salary that are deferred under the
    Employer's qualified and non-qualified employee benefit
    plans.

         2.3  Board.  "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors
     of the Company.

         2.4  Bonus Amount.  "Bonus Amount" shall mean the
    highest annual bonus paid or payable to the Participant for
    any fiscal year in respect of the three (3) full fiscal years
    ended prior to the Change in Control.

         2.5  Cause.  The Participant's Employer may terminate
    the Participant's employment for "Cause" if the Participant
    (a) has been convicted of a felony, (b) failed substantially
    to perform his or her reasonably assigned duties with his or
    her Employer (other than a failure resulting from his or her
    incapacity due to physical or mental illness), or (c) has
    intentionally engaged in conduct which is demonstrably and
    materially injurious to the Company and/or Employer.  No act,
    or failure to act, on the Paricipant's part, shall be
    considered "intentional" unless the Participant has acted, or
    failed to act, with a lack of good faith and with a lack of
    reasonable belief that the Participant's action or failure to
    act was in the best interest of the Company and/or Employer.

         2.6  Change in Control.  "Change in Control" shall mean
    the occurrence during the "Term" (as hereinafter defined) of
    any of the following events:

              (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from the
    Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting
    Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person is used for
    purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) immediately after
    which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
    meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided,
    however, in determining whether a Change in Control has
    occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a
    "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
    constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in
    Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an
    acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a trust
    forming a part thereof) maintained by (a) the Company or (b)
    any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its
    voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is
    owned directly or indirectly by the Company (a "Company
    Subsidiary"), (2) the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or
    (3) any Person in connection with a "Non-Control Transaction"
    (as hereinafter defined).

              (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990,
    are members of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for
    any reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the Board;
    provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for
    election by the Company's stockholders, of any new director
    was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
    Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of the
    Program, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board;
    provided further, however, that no individual shall be
    considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
    initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or
    threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11
    promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

              (c)  Approval by stockholders of the Company of:

                   (1)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization
              involving the Company, unless

                   (i)  the stockholders of the Company,
              immediately before such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization, own, directly or indirectly
              immediately following such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization, at least sixty percent (60%) of the
              combined voting power of the outstanding voting
              securities of the corporation resulting from such
              merger or consolidation or reorganization (the
              "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the same
              proportion as their ownership of the Voting
              Securities immediately before such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization,

                   (ii)  the individuals who were members of the
              Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution
              of the agreement providing for such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization constitute at least
              two-thirds of the members of the board of directors
              of the Surviving Corporation,

                   (iii)  no Person (other than the Company and
              its Company Subsidiaries, any employee benefit plan
              (or any trust forming a part thereof) maintained by
              the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
              Company Subsidiary, or any Person who, immediately
              prior to such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization had Beneficial Ownership of fifteen
              percent (15%) or more of the then outstanding
              Voting Securities) has Beneficial Ownership of
              fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined
              voting power of the Surviving Corporation's then
              outstanding voting securities, and

                   (iv)  a transaction described in clauses (i)
              through (iii) shall herein be referred to as a
              "Non-Control Transaction";

                   (2)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of
              the Company; or

                   (3)  An agreement for the sale or other
              disposition of all or substantially all of the
              assets of the Company to any Person (other than a
              transfer to a Company Subsidiary).

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not
    be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject
    Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the
    permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a
    result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company
    which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
    Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
    any additional Voting Securities which increases the
    percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in
    Control shall occur.

              (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan
    to the contrary, if the Participant's employment is
    terminated during the Term but within one (1) year prior to a
    Change in Control and the Participant reasonably demonstrates
    that such termination (i) was at the request of a third party
    who has indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably
    calculated to effect a Change in Control and who effectuates
    a Change in Control (a "Third Party") or (ii) otherwise
    occurred in connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change
    in Control which actually occurs, then for all purposes of
    the Plan, the date of a Change in Control with respect to the
    Participant shall mean the date immediately prior to the date
    of such termination of the Participant's employment.

         2.7  Company.  "Company" shall mean Tandy Corporation
    and shall include its "Successors and Assigns" (as
    hereinafter defined).

         2.8  Disability.  "Disability" shall mean a physical or
    mental infirmity which impairs the Participant's ability to
    substantially perform his or her duties with his or her
    Employer for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
    days and the Participant has not returned to his or her full
    time employment prior to the Termination Date as stated in
    the "Notice of Termination" (as hereinafter defined).

    occurrence after a Change in Control of any of the events or
    conditions described in Subsections (i) through (iv) hereof:

              Participant's base salary below the Base Amount or
              any failure to pay the Participant any
              compensation or benefits to which he or
              she is entitled within fifteen (15) days of the
              date notice of such failure to pay is given to the
              Employer and, in the case of any annual bonus,
              within forty-five (45) days following the end of
              the fiscal year to which such bonus relates;

                   (ii)  the Employer's requiring him or her to
              be based at any place outside a 20-mile radius
              from his or her place of employment on the day
              prior to the Change in Control, except for
              reasonably required travel on the Employer's
              business which is not materially greater than such
              travel requirements prior to the Change in
              Control;

                   (iii)  the failure by the Employer to
              (A) continue in effect (without reduction in
              benefit levels, reward opportunities and/or bonus
              potential for comparable performance) any material
              compensation or benefit plan in which the
              Participant was participating at any time within
              ninety (90) days preceding the Change in Control or
              at any time thereafter including but not limited
              to, the plans listed on Schedule B, unless such
              plan is replaced with a plan that provides
              substantially equivalent compensation or benefits
              to the Participant, or (B) provide the Participant

                   (iv)  the failure of the Company and/or the
              Employer to obtain an agreement from any Successor
              or Assign of the Company, to assume and agree to
              perform the Plan, as contemplated in Section

    Control, "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice of
    termination of the Participant's employment from the Employer
    which indicates the specific termination provision in the

    be an Eligible Employee of the Employer at any time prior to
    a Change in Control.  A Participant entitled to receive any

    the Plan until all amounts he or she is entitled to have been
    paid to him or her.

                             ARTICLE IV

    Employer for Cause or Disability, or (c) by the Participant
    without Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled to
    receive and the Company shall pay, his or her Accrued
    Compensation and, if such termination is other than by his or
    her Employer for Cause, a Pro Rata Bonus.

         4.2  Payment in Event of Certain Terminations of
    Employment.  In the event that a Participant's employment
    with his or her Employer is terminated following a Change in
    Control during the Term by the Participant or by his or her
    Employer for any reason other than as specified in Section
    4.1, the Participant shall be entitled to receive under the
    Plan:

              (a)  a cash payment equal to the sum of:

                   (i)    his or her Accrued Compensation and Pro
                          Rata Bonus,

                   (ii)   his or her Base Amount, and

                   (iii)  his or her Bonus Amount;

              (b)  for a period of twelve (12) months beginning
    on the Participant's Termination Date (the "Continuation
    Period"), the Company shall at its expense continue on behalf
    of the Participant and his or her dependents and
    beneficiaries the fringe benefits (excluding those benefit
    plans numbered 1 through 8 inclusive on Schedule B but
    including an Employer-provided automobile or automobile
    allowance and the related expenses of public liability
    insurance, collision coverage, repairs and maintenance) and
    life insurance, disability, medical, dental and
    hospitalization benefits provided (i) to the Participant any
    time during the 90-day period prior to the Change in Control
    or at any time thereafter or (ii) to other similarly situated
    employees who continue in the employ of the Company and/or
    the Employer during the Continuation Period; provided,
    however, that with respect to any Participant who was
    entitled to the use of an automobile provided by his or her
    Employer within the ninety (90) day period prior to a Change
    in Control or at anytime thereafter, he or she shall be paid
    a cash payment equal to the value to him or her for the
    Continuation Period of the Employer-provided automobile.  The
    coverage and benefits (including deductibles, costs and
    contributions by the Participant, if any) provided in this
    Section 4.2(b) during the Continuation Period shall be no
    less favorable to the Participant and his or her dependants
    and beneficiaries than the most favorable of such coverages
    and benefits during any of the periods referred to in clauses
    (i) and (ii) above.  The obligation hereunder with respect to
    the foregoing benefits (except for the automobile or
    automobile allowance) shall be limited if the Participant
    obtains any such benefits pursuant to a subsequent employer's
    benefit plans, in which case the Employer (or the Company, as
    the case may be) may reduce the coverage of any benefits it
    is required to provide the Participant hereunder as long as
    the aggregate coverages and benefits of the combined benefit
    plans is no less favorable to the Participant than the
    coverages and benefits required to be provided hereunder. 
    This Subsection (b) shall not be interpreted so as to limit
    any benefits to which the Participant, his or her dependents
    or beneficiaries may be entitled under any of the Company's
    or the Employer's employee benefit plans, programs or
    practices following his or her termination of employment,
    including without limitation, retiree medical and life
    insurance benefits;

              (c)  the Company shall pay in a single payment an
    amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the maximum amount
    the Participant could have contributed under the Deferred
    Salary and Investment Plan, Stock Purchase Program and
    Supplemental Stock Program as in effect on the date
    immediately prior to the Change in Control during the
    Continuation Period had he or she continued in employment
    with the Employer during the restructure period at the
    greater of his or her annualized gross salary and wages as in
    effect immediately prior to the Change in Control or at any
    time thereafter; and

              (d)  The amounts provided for in Sections 4.1,
    4.2(a), 4.2(b) (only as to the automobile allowance and the
    related expenses of public liability insurance, collision
    coverage, repairs and maintenance) and 4.2(c) shall be paid
    in a single lump sum cash payment within five (5) days after
    the Participant's Termination Date (or earlier, if required
    by applicable law).

         4.3  Mitigation.  The Participant shall not be required
    to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in the
    Plan by seeking other employment or otherwise and no such
    payment shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any
    compensation or benefits provided to the Participant in any
    subsequent employment.

         4.4  Termination Pay.  The payments and benefits
    provided for in Section 4.2(a)(ii) and (iii) shall reduce the
    amount of any cash severance or termination pay payable to
    the Participant under any other Employer severance or
    termination plan, program, policy or practice.

         4.5  Other Benefits.  The Participant's entitlement to
    any other compensation or benefits (other than the Pro Rata
    Bonus) shall be determined in accordance with the Employer's
    employee benefit plans (including, the plans listed on
    Schedule B) and other applicable programs, policies and
    practices then in effect.


                              ARTICLE V

                      TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

         5.1  Notice of Termination Required.  Following a Change
    in Control, any purported termination of the Participant's
    employment by the Employer shall be communicated by Notice of
    Termination to the Participant.  For purposes of the Plan, no
    such purported termination shall be effective without such
    Notice of Termination.


                              ARTICLE VI

                 LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY

         6.1  Excise Tax Limitation.

              (a)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan
    to the contrary, to the extent that the payments and benefits
    provided under the Plan and benefits provided to, or for the
    benefit of, the Participant under any other Employer plan or
    agreement (such payments or benefits are collectively
    referred to as the "Payments") would be subject to the excise
    tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the
    Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) if and to the
    extent that a reduction in the Payments would result in the
    Participant retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis
    (taking into account federal, state and local income taxes
    and the Excise Tax), than if the Participant received all of
    the Payments (such reduced amount is hereinafter referred to
    as the "Limited Payment Amount").  Unless the Participant
    shall have given prior written notice specifying a different
    order to the Company to effectuate the Limited Payment
    Amount, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Payments,
    by first reducing or eliminating those payments or benefits
    which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or
    eliminating cash payments, in each case in reverse order
    beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the
    farthest in time from the "Determination" (as hereinafter
    defined).  Any notice given by the Participant pursuant to
    the preceding sentence shall take precedence over the
    provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement
    governing the Participant's rights and entitlements to any
    benefits or compensation.

              (b)  An initial determination as to whether the
    Payments shall be reduced to the Limited Payment Amount
    pursuant to the Plan and the amount of such Limited Payment
    Amount shall be made by an accounting firm at the Company's
    expense selected by the Company which is designated as one of
    the five (5) largest accounting firms in the United States
    (the "Accounting Firm").  The Accounting Firm shall provide
    its determination (the "Determination"), together with
    detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the
    Company and the Participant within five (5) days of the
    Termination Date if applicable, or such other time as
    requested by the Company or by the Participant (provided the
    Participant reasonably believes that any of the Payments may
    be subject to the Excise Tax) and if the Accounting Firm
    determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Participant
    with respect to a Payment or Payments, it shall furnish the
    Participant with an opinion reasonably acceptable to the
    Participant that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect
    to any such Payment or Payments.  Within ten (10) days of the
    delivery of the Determination to the Participant, the
    Participant shall have the right to dispute the Determination
    (the "Dispute").  If there is no Dispute, the Determination
    shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and
    the Participant subject to the application of Paragraph
    6.1(c) below.

              (c)  As a result of the uncertainty in the
    application of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, it is
    possible that the Payments to be made to, or provided for the
    benefit of, the Participant either have been made or will not
    be made by the Company which, in either case, will be
    inconsistent with the limitations provided in Section 6(a)
    (hereinafter referred to as an "Excess Payment" or
    "Underpayment", respectively).  If it is established pursuant
    to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue
    Service (the "IRS") proceeding which has been finally and
    conclusively resolved, that an Excess Payment has been made,
    such Excess Payment shall be deemed for all purposes to be a
    loan to the Participant made on the date the Participant
    received the Excess Payment and the Participant shall repay
    the Excess Payment to the Company on demand (but not less
    than ten (10) days after written notice is received by the
    Participant) together with interest on the Excess Payment at
    the "Applicable Federal Rate" (as defined in Section 1274(d)
    of the Code) from the date of the Participant's receipt of
    such Excess Payment until the date of such repayment.  In the
    event that it is determined by (i) the Accounting Firm, the
    Company (which shall include the position taken by the
    Company, or together with its consolidated group, on its
    federal income tax return) or the IRS, (ii) pursuant to a
    determination by a court, or (iii) upon the resolution to the
    Participant's satisfaction of the Dispute, that an
    Underpayment has occurred, the Company shall pay an amount
    equal to the Underpayment to the Participant within ten (10)
    days of such determination or resolution together with
    interest on such amount at the Applicable Federal Rate from
    the date such amount would have been paid to the Participant
    until the date of payment.


                              ARTICLE VII

                         SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

         7.1  Successors and Assigns.

              (a)  The Plan shall be binding upon and shall inure
    to the benefit of the Company and the Employer.  The Company
    and the Employer shall require any Successor or Assign to
    expressly assume and agree to perform the Plan in the same
    manner and to the same extent that the Company and/or the
    Employer would be required to perform it if no such
    succession or assignment had taken place.

              (b)  Neither the Plan nor any right or interest
    hereunder shall be assignable or transferable by the
    Participant, his or her beneficiaries or legal
    representatives, except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution; provided, however, that the Plan shall inure to
    the benefit of and be enforceable by the Participant's legal
    personal representative.

         7.2  Sale of Business or Assets.  Notwithstanding
    anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, if a
    Participant's employment with his or her Employer is
    terminated in connection with the sale, divestiture or other
    disposition of any Subsidiary or division of the Company (or
    part thereof) such termination shall not be a termination of
    employment of the Participant for purposes of the Plan and
    the Participant shall not be entitled to benefits from the
    Company under the Plan as a result of such sale, divestiture,
    or other disposition, or as a result of any subsequent
    termination of employment, provided that (a) the Participant
    is offered employment by the purchaser or acquiror of such
    Subsidiary or division (or part thereof) and (b) the Company
    obtains an agreement from such purchaser or acquiror to
    perform the Company's and/or Employer's obligations under the
    Plan, in the same manner, and to the same extent that the
    Company and/or the Employer would be required to perform if
    no such purchase or acquisition had taken place.  In such
    circumstances, the purchaser or acquiror shall be solely
    responsible for providing any benefits payable under the Plan
    to any such Participant.


                              ARTICLE VIII

                   TERM, AMENDMENT AND PLAN TERMINATION

         8.1  Term.  The Plan shall continue in effect for a
    period of two (2) years commencing on the Effective Date and
    shall be automatically extended for one (1) year on the first
    anniversary of the Effective Date and on each anniversary of
    the Effective Date thereafter unless the Company shall have
    delivered a written notice to each Participant at least
    ninety (90) days prior to any extension that the Plan shall
    not be so extended; provided, however, that if a Change in
    Control occurs while the Plan is in effect, the Plan shall
    not end prior to the expiration of two (2) years following
    the Change in Control.

         8.2  Amendment and Termination.  Subject to Section 8.1,
    the Plan may be terminated or amended in any respect by
    resolution adopted by two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the
    Incumbent Board and Schedule A may be amended to (x) add
    Eligible Employees at any time (y) prior to a Change in
    Control, to eliminate any Eligible Employee by reason of his
    or her demotion in position by any duly authorized officer of
    the Company; provided, however, that no such amendment or
    termination of the Plan or Schedule A during the Term may be
    made (a) if such amendment or termination would adversely
    affect any right of an Eligible Employee who became an
    Eligible Employee (except as provided in clause (y) above)
    prior to the later of (i) the date of adoption of any such
    amendment or termination, or (ii) the effective date of any
    such amendment or termination, (b) at the request of a Third
    Party, or (c) otherwise in connection with, or in
    anticipation of, a Change in Control; and provided, further,
    however, that the Plan no longer shall be subject to
    amendment, change, substitution, deletion, revocation or
    termination in any respect whatsoever following a Change in
    Control.

         8.3  Form of Amendment.  The form of any amendment or
    termination of the Plan shall be a written instrument signed
    by a duly authorized officer or officers of the Company,
    certifying that the amendment or termination has been
    approved by the Board in accordance with Section 8.2.


                               ARTICLE IX

                              MISCELLANEOUS

         9.1  Contractual Right.  Upon and after a Change in
    Control, each Participant shall have a fully vested,
    nonforfeitable contractual right, enforceable against the
    Company, to the benefits provided for under Sections 4.1, 4.2
    and 4.3 of the Plan upon satisfaction of the applicable
    conditions specified in those Sections.

         9.2  Employment Status.  Prior to a Change in Control,
    each Eligible Employee shall continue in his or her status as
    an employee-at-will and the Plan does not constitute a
    contract of employment or impose on the Employer any
    obligation to (a) retain the Participant, (b) make any
    payments upon termination of employment, (c) change the
    status of the Participant's employment or (d) change any
    employment policies of the Employer.

         9.3  Notice.  For the purposes of the Plan, notices and
    all other communications provided for in the Plan (including
    the Notice of Termination) shall be in writing and shall be
    deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or
    sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
    prepaid, addressed to the respective addresses last given by
    each party to the other, provided that all notices to the
    Company and/or the Employer shall be directed to the
    attention of the Board with a copy to the Secretary of the
    Company.  All notices and communications shall be deemed to
    have been received on the date of delivery thereof or on the
    third business day after the mailing thereof, except that
    notice of change of address shall be effective only upon
    receipt.

         9.4  Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as provided in
    Section 4.4, nothing in the Plan shall prevent or limit the
    Participant's continuing or future participation in any
    benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided
    by the Company and/or the Employer for which the Participant
    may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or reduce such
    rights as the Participant may have under any other agreements
    with the Company and/or the Employer.  Amounts which are
    vested benefits or which the Participant is otherwise
    entitled to receive under any plan or program of the Company
    and/or the Employer shall be payable in accordance with such
    plan or program, except as explicitly modified by the Plan.
    No additional compensation provided under any benefit or
    compensation plans to the Participant shall be deemed to
    modify or otherwise affect the terms of the Plan or any of
    the Participant's entitlements hereunder.

         9.5  Settlement of Claims.  The Company's obligation to
    make the payments provided for in the Plan and otherwise to
    perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by
    any circumstances, including without limitation, any set-off,
    counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the
    Company and/or Employer may have against the Participant or
    others.

         9.6  Trust.  All benefits under the Plan shall be paid
    by the Company.  The Plan shall be unfunded and the benefits
    hereunder shall be paid only from the general assets of the
    Company; provided, however, notwithstanding anything
    contained in the Plan to the contrary, nothing herein shall
    prevent or prohibit the Company from establishing a trust or
    other arrangement for the purpose of providing for the
    payment of the benefits payable under the Plan.

         9.7  Waiver or Discharge.  No provision of the Plan may
    be waived or discharged unless such waiver or discharge is
    agreed to in writing and signed by the Participant, the
    Employer and the Company.  No waiver by either the Company,
    the Employer or any Participant at any time of any breach by
    either the Company, the Employer or any Participant of, or
    compliance with, any condition or provision of the Plan to be
    performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of
    similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or
    at any prior or subsequent time.

         9.8  Governing Law.  THE VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION,
    CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PLAN SHALL IN ALL
    RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
    ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT GIVING
    EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF; PROVIDED,
    HOWEVER, THAT IN ANY ACTION INVOLVING A PARTICIPANT, THE
    COMPANY AND/OR THE EMPLOYER WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OR
    ASSERTION THAT THE PARTICIPANT'S EMPLOYMENT WAS PROPERLY
    TERMINATED FOR CAUSE, THE COMPANY AND/OR THE EMPLOYER HAS THE
    BURDEN OF PROVING THAT THE PARTICIPANT'S EMPLOYMENT WAS
    PROPERLY TERMINATED FOR CAUSE.

         9.9  Validity and Severability.  The invalidity or
    unenforceability of any provision of the Plan shall not
    affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
    of the Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect, and
    any prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
    not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
    other jurisdiction.

         9.10  Legal Fees.  Following a Change in Control, the
    Company shall pay all legal fees and related expenses
    (including the costs of experts, evidence and counsel)
    incurred by the Participant as they become due as a result of
    (a) the Participant's termination of employment (including
    all such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in contesting or
    disputing any such termination of employment), or (b) the
    Participant's seeking to obtain or enforce any right or
    benefit provided by the Plan (including any such fees and
    expenses incurred in connection with the Dispute) or by any
    other plan or arrangement maintained by the Company and/or
    Employer under which the Participant is or may be entitled to
    receive benefits; provided however, that the circumstances
    set forth in clauses (a) and (b) (other than as a result of
    the Participant's termination of employment under
    circumstances described in Section 2.6(d)) occurred on or
    after a Change in Control; provided, further, however, in the
    event a court finally determines that the claim by the
    Participant for which legal fees were incurred and paid by
    the Company pursuant to this Section 9.10 was frivilous, the
    Company shall be reimbursed by the Participant for any legal
    fees paid under this Section 9.10 in respect of such
    frivilous claim.

         9.11  Forum.  Any suit brought by a Participant under
    the Plan may be brought in the appropriate state or federal
    court for Tarrant County, Texas, or for the county wherein
    the Participant maintains his or her residence.  Any suit
    brought by the Company and/or Employer under the Plan may
    only be brought in the county wherein the Participant
    maintains his or her residence, unless the Participant
    consents to suit elsewhere.

                      TERMINATION PROTECTION PLAN

                              "LEVEL II"


         WHEREAS, the "Board" of the "Company" (as those terms
    are hereinafter defined) recognizes that the possibility of a
    future "Change in Control" (as hereinafter defined) exists
    and that the threat or occurrence of a Change in Control
    could result in significant distractions to its employees
    because of the uncertainties inherent in such a situation;
    and

         WHEREAS, the Board has determined that it is essential
    and in the best interest of the Company, its stockholders and
    the "Employer" (as hereinafter defined) to retain the
    services of certain of its employees in the event of a threat
    or the occurence of a Change in Control and to ensure their
    continued dedication and efforts in such event without undue
    concern for their employment and personal financial security.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in order to fulfill these purposes, the
    following is hereby adopted.


                               ARTICLE I

                         ESTABLISHMENT OF PLAN

         1.0  As of the Effective Date, the Company hereby
    establishes the Tandy Corporation Termination Protection Plan
    Level II (the "Plan") as set forth in this document.


                               ARTICLE II

                              DEFINITIONS

         As used herein the following words and phrases shall
    have the following respective meanings for purposes of the
    Plan unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

         2.1  Accrued Compensation.  "Accrued Compensation" shall
    mean an amount which shall include all amounts earned or
    accrued through the "Termination Date" (as hereinafter
    defined) but not paid as of the Termination Date including

    necessary expenses incurred by the "Participant" (as
    hereinafter defined) on behalf of the Employer during the
    period ending on the Termination Date, (iii) vacation pay as
    required by law, and (iv) bonuses and incentive compensation
    (other than the "Pro Rata Bonus" (as hereinafter defined)).

         2.2  Base Amount.  "Base Amount" shall mean the greater
    of the Participant's annual base salary (a) at the rate in
    effect on the Termination Date or (b) at the highest rate in
    effect at any time during the ninety (90) day period prior to
    the Change in Control, and shall include all amounts of the
    Participant's base salary that are deferred under the
    Employer's qualified and non-qualified employee benefit
    plans.

         2.3  Board.  "Board" shall mean the Board of Directors
    of the Company.

         2.4  Bonus Amount.  "Bonus Amount" shall mean the

    the Participant's employment for "Cause" if the Participant
    (a) has been convicted of a felony, (b) failed substantially

    her Employer (other than a failure resulting from his or her
    incapacity due to physical or mental illness), or (c) has
    intentionally engaged in conduct which is demonstrably and
    materially injurious to the Company and/or Employer.  No act,
    or failure to act, on the Participant's part, shall be
    considered "intentional" unless the Participant has acted, or
    failed to act, with a lack of good faith and with a lack of
    reasonable belief that the Participant's act or failure to
    act was in the best interest of the Company and/or Employer.

         2.6  Change in Control.  "Change in Control" shall mean
    the occurrence during the "Term" (as hereinafter defined) of
    any of the following events:

              (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from the
    Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting
    Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person is used for
    purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) immediately after
    which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
    meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided,
    however, in determining whether a Change in Control has
    occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a
    "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
    constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in
    Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an
    acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a trust
    forming a part thereof) maintained by (a) the Company or (b)
    any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its
    voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is
    owned directly or indirectly by the Company (a "Company
    Subsidiary"), (2) the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or
    (3) any Person in connection with a "Non-Control Transaction"
    (as hereinafter defined).

              (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990,
    are members of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for
    any reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the Board;
    provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for
    election by the Company's stockholders, of any new director
    was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
    Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of the
    Program, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board;
    provided further, however, that no individual shall be
    considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
    initially asssumed office as a result of either an actual or
    threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11
    promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

              (c)  Approval by stockholders of the Company of:

                   (1)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization
              involving the Company, unless

                   (i)  the stockholders of the Company,
              immediately before such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization, own, directly or indirectly
              immediately following such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization, at least sixty percent (60%) of the
              combined voting power of the outstanding voting
              securities of the corporation resulting from such
              merger or consolidation or reorganization (the
              "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the same
              proportion as their ownership of the Voting
              Securities immediately before such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization,

                   (ii)  the individuals who were members of the
              Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution
              of the agreement providing for such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization constitute at least
              two-thirds of the members of the board of directors
              of the Surviving Corporation,

                   (iii)  no Person (other than the Company and
              its Company Subsidiaries, any employee benefit plan
              (or any trust forming a part thereof) maintained by
              the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
              Company Subsidiary, or any Person who, immediately
              prior to such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization had Beneficial Ownership of fifteen
              percent (15%) or more of the then outstanding
              Voting Securities) has Beneficial Ownership of
              fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined
              voting power of the Surviving Corporation's then
              outstanding voting securities, and 

                   (iv)  a transaction described in clauses (i)
              through (iii) shall herein be referred to as a
              "Non-Control Transaction";

                   (2)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of
              the Company; or 

                   (3)  An agreement for the sale or other
              disposition of all or substantially all of the
              assets of the Company to any Person (other than a
              transfer to a Company Subsidiary).

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not
    be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject
    Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the
    permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a
    result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company
    which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
    Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
    any additional Voting Securities which increases the
    percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in
    Control shall occur.

              (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan
    to the contrary, if the Participant's employment is
    terminated during the Term but within one (1) year prior to a
    Change in Control and the Participant reasonably demonstrates
    that such termination (i) was at the request of a third party
    who has indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably
    calculated to effect a Change in Control and who effectuates
    a Change in Control (a "Third Party") or (ii) otherwise
    occurred in connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change
    in Control which actually occurs, then for all purposes of
    the Plan, the date of a Change in Control with respect to the
    Participant shall mean the date immediately prior to the date
    of such termination of the Participant's employment.

         2.7  Company.  "Company" shall mean Tandy Corporation
    and shall include its "Successors and Assigns" (as
    hereinafter defined).

         2.8  Disability.  "Disability" shall mean a physical or
    mental infirmity which impairs the Participant's ability to
    substantially perform his or her duties with his or her
    Employer for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive
    days and the Participant has not returned to his or her full
    time employment prior to the Termination Date as stated in
    the "Notice of Termination" (as hereinafter defined).

    those positions set forth on Schedule A) and any individual
    set forth on Schedule B.  For purposes of this Section 2.10,
    an employee's annual compensation shall be determined by his
    or her annualized rate of salary in effect immediately prior
    to a Change in Control and the bonus paid to the employee in
    respect of the fiscal year ended immediately prior to the
    Change in Control.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, those
    employees who are employed in the categories of positions set
    forth on Schedule A, any employee covered by a collective
    bargaining agreement, any employee who is a party to a
    severance or termination protection agreement, or the
    Termination Protection Plan Level I, shall not be an
    "Eligible Employee" for purposes of the Plan.

         2.11  Employer.  "Employer" shall mean the Company or
    its divisions or its "Subsidiaries" (as hereinafter defined)
    with whom the Eligible Employee is employed.

         2.12  (a) Good Reason.  "Good Reason" shall mean the
    occurrence after a Change in Control of any of the events or

              base salary below the Base Amount or any failure to
              pay the Participant any compensation or benefits to
              which he or she is entitled within fifteen (15)
              days of the date notice of such failure to pay is
              given to the Employer and, in the case of any
              annual bonus, within forty-five (45) days following
              the end of the fiscal year to which such bonus
              relates;

              (ii)  the failure by the Employer to (A) continue
              in effect (without reduction in benefit levels,
              reward opportunities and/or bonus potential for
              comparable performance) any material compensation
              or benefit plan in which the Participant was
              participating at any time within ninety (90) days
              preceding the Change in Control or at any time
              thereafter including but not limited to, the plans
              listed on Schedule C, unless such plan is replaced

              benefits, in the aggregate at least equal (in terms
              of benefit levels and/or reward opportunities) to
              those provided for under each other employee
              benefit plan, program and practice in which the
              Participant was participating at any time within
              ninety (90) days preceding the Change in Control or
              at any time thereafter; and 

              (iii)  the failure of the Company and/or the
              Employer to obtain an agreement from any Successor
              or Assign of the Company, to assume and agree to
              perform the Plan, as contemplated in Section
              7.1 hereof.

              (b)  Any event or condition described in this
    Section 2.12(a)(i) through (iii) which occurs during the Term
    but within one (1) year prior to a Change in Control but
    which the Participant reasonably demonstrates (i) was at the
    request of a Third Party or (ii) otherwise arose in
    connection with or in anticipation of a Change in Control
    which actually occurs, shall constitute Good Reason for
    purposes of the Plan notwithstanding that it occurred prior
    to the Change in Control.

         2.13  Notice of Termination.  Following a Change in
    Control, "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice of
    termination of the Participant's employment from the Employer
    which indicates the specific termination provision in the
    Plan relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the
    facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for

    provision so indicated.

         2.14  Participant.  "Participant" shall mean an Eligible
    Employee who satisfies the requirements of Section 3.1 and
    who has not ceased to be a Participant pursuant to Section
    3.2.

         2.15  Pro-Rata Bonus.  "Pro-Rata Bonus" shall mean the
    Bonus Amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
    is the number of days in the Company's fiscal year through

    Notice of Termination is given to the Participant; provided,
    further, however, that in the case of Disability the
    Participant shall not have returned to the full-time
    performance of his or her duties during such period of at

                               ARTICLE III

                               ELIGIBILITY

         3.1  Participation.  Each employee shall become a
    Participant in the Plan immediately upon becoming an Eligible
    Employee.

         3.2  Duration of Participation.  A Participant shall
    cease to be a Participant in the Plan if he or she ceases to
    be an Eligible Employee of the Employer at any time prior to

                               ARTICLE IV

                          TERMINATION BENEFITS

         4.1  Payment of Accrued Compensation.  In the event that
    a Participant's employment with his or her Employer is
    terminated following a Change in Control during the Term (a)
    by reason of the Participant's death, (b) by his or her
    Employer for Cause or Disability, or (c) by the Participant
    without Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled to
    receive and the Company shall pay, his or her Accrued
    Compensation and if such termination is other than by his or
    her Employer for Cause, a Pro Rata Bonus.

         4.2  Payment in Event of Certain Terminations of
    Employment.  In the event that a Participant's employment is
    terminated following a Change in Control during the Term by
    the Participant or by his or her Employer for any reason
    other than as specified in Section 4.1, the Participant shall
    be entitled to receive under the Plan:

              (a)  a cash payment equal to the sum of:

              (i)       his or her Accrued Compensation and Pro
                        Rata Bonus,

              (ii)      one-half of his or her Base Amount, and

              (iii)     one-half of his or her Bonus Amount;

              (b)  for a period of six months following the
    Participant's Termination Date (the "Continuation Period"),
    the Company shall at its expense continue on behalf of the
    Participant and his or her dependents and beneficiaries the
    fringe benefits (excluding those benefit plans numbered 1
    through 8 inclusive on Schedule C but including an
    Employer-provided automobile or automobile allowance and the
    related expenses of public liability insurance, collision
    coverage, repairs and maintenance) and life insurance,
    disability, medical, dental and hospitalization benefits
    provided (i) to the Participant any time during the 90-day
    period prior to the Change in Control or at any time
    thereafter or (ii) to other similarly situated employees who
    continue in the employ of the Company and/or the Employer
    during the Continuation Period; provided, however, that with
    respect to any Participant who was entitled to the use of an
    automobile provided by the Employer within the ninety (90)
    day period prior to a Change in Control or at anytime
    thereafter, he or she shall be paid a cash payment equal to
    the value to him or her for the Continuation Period of the
    Employer-provided automobile.  The coverage and benefits
    (including deductibles, costs and contributions by the
    Participant, if any) provided in this Section 4.2(b) during
    the Continuation Period shall be no less favorable to the
    Participant and his or her beneficiaries than the most
    favorable of such coverages and benefits during any of the
    periods referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above.  The
    obligation hereunder with respect to the foregoing benefits
    (except for the automobile or automobile allowance) shall be
    limited if the Participant obtains any such benefits pursuant
    to a subsequent employer's benefit plans, in which case the
    Employer (or the Company, as the case may be) may reduce the
    coverage of any benefits it is required to provide the
    Participant hereunder as long as the aggregate coverages and
    benefits of the combined benefit plans is no less favorable
    to the Participant than the coverages and benefits required
    to be provided hereunder.  This Subsection (b) shall not be
    interpreted so as to limit any benefits to which the
    Participant, his or her dependents or beneficiaries may be
    entitled under any of the Employer's employee benefit plans,
    programs or practices following his or her termination of
    employment, including without limitation, retiree medical and
    life insurance benefits;

              (c)  the Company shall pay in a single payment an
    amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the maximum amount
    the Participant could have contributed under the Deferred
    Salary and Investment Plan, Stock Purchase Program and
    Supplemental Stock Program as in effect on the date
    immediately prior to the Change in Control during the
    Continuation Period had he or she continued in employment
    with the Employer during the Continuation Period at the
    greater of his or her annualized gross salary and wages as in
    effect immediately prior to the Change in Control or at any
    time thereafter; and

              (d)  The amounts provided for in Sections 4.1,
    4.2(a), 4.2(b) (only as to the automobile allowance and the
    related expenses of public liability insurance, collision
    coverage, repairs and maintenance) and 4.2(c) shall be paid
    in a single lump sum cash payment within five (5) days after
    the Participant's Termination Date (or earlier, if required
    by applicable law).

         4.3  Mitigation.  The Participant shall not be required
    to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in the
    Plan by seeking other employment or otherwise and no such
    payment shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any
    compensation or benefits provided to the Participant in any
    subsequent employment.

         4.4  Termination Pay.  The payments and benefits
    provided for in Section 4.2(a)(ii) and (iii) shall reduce the
    amount of any cash severance or termination pay payable to
    the Participant under any other Employer severance or
    termination plan, program, policy or practice.

         4.5 Other Benefits.  The Participant's entitlement to
    any other compensation or benefits (other than the Pro Rata
    Bonus) shall be determined in accordance with the Employer's
    employee benefit plans (including, the plans listed on
    Schedule C) and other applicable programs, policies and
    practices then in effect.


                               ARTICLE V

                      TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

         5.1  Notice of Termination Required.  Following a Change
    in Control, any purported termination of the Participant's
    employment by the Employer shall be communicated by Notice of
    Termination to the Participant.  For purposes of the Plan, no
    such purported termination shall be effective without such
    Notice of Termination.


                               ARTICLE VI

                 LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY

         6.1  Excise Tax Limitation.

              (a)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan
    to the contrary, to the extent that the payments and benefits
    provided under the Plan and benefits provided to, or for the
    benefit of, the Participant under any other Employer plan or
    agreement (such payments or benefits are collectively
    referred to as the "Payments") would be subject to the excise
    tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the
    Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) if and to the
    extent necessary so that no Payment to be made or benefit to
    be provided to the Participant shall be subject to the Excise
    Tax (such reduced amount is hereinafter referred to as the
    "Limited Payment Amount").  Unless the Participant shall have
    given prior written notice specifying a different order to
    the Company to effectuate the Limited Payment Amount, the
    Company shall reduce or eliminate the Payments, by first
    reducing or eliminating those payments or benefits which are
    not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash
    payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with
    payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in
    time from the Determination (as hereinafter defined).  Any
    notice given by the Participant pursuant to the preceding
    sentence shall take precedence over the provisions of any
    other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the
    Participant's rights and entitlements to any benefits or
    compensation.

              (b)  An initial determination as to whether the
    Payments shall be reduced to the Limited Payment Amount
    pursuant to the Plan and the amount of such Limited Payment
    Amount shall be made by an accounting firm at the Company's
    expense selected by the Company which is designated as one of
    the five largest accounting firms in the United States (the
    "Accounting Firm").  The Accounting Firm shall provide its
    determination (the "Determination"), together with detailed
    supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and
    the Participant within five (5) days of the Termination Date
    ifapplicable, or such other time as requested by the Company
    or by the Participant (provided the Participant reasonably
    believes that any of the Payments may be subject to the
    Excise Tax) and if the Accounting Firm determines that no
    Excise Tax is payable by the Participant with respect to a
    Payment or Payments, it shall furnish the Participant with an
    opinion reasonably acceptable to the Participant that no
    Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such Payment
    or Payments.  Within ten (10) days of the delivery of the
    Determination to the Participant, the Participant shall have
    the right to dispute the Determination (the "Dispute").  If
    there is no Dispute, the Determination shall be binding,
    final and conclusive upon the Company and the Participant
    subject to the application of Paragraph 6.1(c) below.

              (c)  As a result of the uncertainty in the
    application of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, it is
    possible that the Payments to be made to, or provided for the
    benefit of, the Participant either have been made or will not
    be made by the Company which, in either case, will be
    inconsistent with the limitations provided in Section 6(a)
    (hereinafter referred to as an "Excess Payment" or
    "Underpayment", respectively).  If it is established pursuant
    to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue
    Service (the "IRS") proceeding which has been finally and
    conclusively resolved, that an Excess Payment has been made,
    such Excess Payment shall be deemed for all purposes to be a
    loan to the Participant made on the date the Participant
    received the Excess Payment and the Participant shall repay
    the Excess Payment to the Company on demand (but not less
    than ten (10) days after written notice is received by the
    Participant) together with interest on the Excess Payment at
    the "Applicable Federal Rate" (as defined in Section 1274(d)
    of the Code) from the date of the Participant's receipt of
    such Excess Payment until the date of such repayment.  In the
    event that it is determined by (i) the Accounting Firm, the
    Company (which shall include the position taken by the
    Company, or together with its consolidated group, on its
    federal income tax return) or the IRS, (ii) pursuant to a
    determination by a court, or (iii) upon the resolution to the
    Participant's satisfaction of the Dispute, that an
    Underpayment has occurred, the Company shall pay an amount
    equal to the Underpayment to the Participant within ten (10)
    days of such determination or resolution together with
    interest on such amount at the Applicable Federal Rate from
    the date such amount would have been paid to the Participant
    until the date of payment.


                               ARTICLE VII

                         SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

         7.1  Successors and Assigns.

              (a)  The Plan shall be binding upon and shall inure
    to the benefit of the Company and the Employer.  The Company
    and the Employer shall require any Successor or Assign to
    expressly assume and agree to perform the Plan in the same
    manner and to the same extent that the Company and/or the
    Employer would be required to perform it if no such
    succession or assignment had taken place.

              (b)  Neither the Plan nor any right or interest
    hereunder shall be assignable or transferable by the
    Participant, his or her beneficiaries or legal
    representatives, except by will or by the laws of descent and
    distribution; provided, however, that the Plan shall inure to
    the benefit of and be enforceable by the Participant's legal
    personal representative.

         7.2  Sale of Business or Assets.  Notwithstanding
    anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, if a
    Participant's employment with his or her Employer is
    terminated in connection with the sale, divestiture or other
    disposition of any Subsidiary or division of the Company (or
    part thereof) such termination shall not be a termination of
    employment of the Participant for purposes of the Plan and
    the Participant shall not be entitled to benefits from the
    Company under the Plan as a result of such sale, divestiture,
    or other disposition, or as a result of any subsequent
    termination of employment, provided that (a) the Participant
    is offered employment by the purchaser or acquiror of such
    Subsidiary or division (or part thereof) and (b) the Company
    obtains an agreement from such purchaser or acquiror to
    perform the Company's and/or the Employer's obligations under
    the Plan, in the same manner, and to the same extent that the
    Company and/or the Employer would be required to perform if
    no such purchase or acquisition had taken place.  In such
    circumstances, the purchaser or acquiror shall be solely
    responsible for providing any benefits payable under the Plan
    to any such Participant.


                               ARTICLE VIII

                  TERM, AMENDMENT AND PLAN TERMINATION

         8.1  Term.  The Plan shall continue in effect for a
    period of two (2) years commencing on the Effective Date and
    shall be automatically extended for one (1) year on the first
    anniversary of the Effective Date and on each anniversary of
    the Effective Date thereafter unless the Company shall have
    delivered a written notice to each Participant at least
    ninety (90) days prior to any extension that the Plan shall
    not be so extended; provided, however, that if a Change in
    Control occurs while the Plan is in effect, the Plan shall
    not end prior to the expiration of two (2) years following
    the Change in Control.

         8.2  Amendment and Termination.  Subject to Section 8.1,
    the Plan may be terminated or amended in any respect by
    resolution adopted by two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the
    Incumbent Board and Schedules A and B may be amended to add
    Eligible Employees at any time by any duly authorized officer
    of the Company; provided, however, that no such amendment or
    termination of the Plan during the Term may be made (a) if
    such amendment or termination would adversely affect any
    right of an Eligible Employee who became an Eligible Employee
    prior to the later of (i) the date of adoption of any such
    amendment or termination, or (ii) the effective date of any
    such amendment or termination, (b) at the request of a Third
    Party, or (c) otherwise in connection with, or in
    anticipation of, a Change in Control; and provided, further,
    however, that the Plan no longer shall be subject to
    amendment, change, substitution, deletion, revocation or
    termination in any respect whatsoever following a Change in
    Control.

         8.3  Form of Amendment.  The form of any amendment or
    termination of the Plan shall be a written instrument signed
    by a duly authorized officer or officers of the Company,
    certifying that the amendment or termination has been
    approved by the Board in accordance with Section 8.2.


                               ARTICLE IX

                              MISCELLANEOUS

         9.1  Contractual Right.  Upon and after a Change in
    Control, each Participant shall have a fully vested,
    nonforfeitable contractual right, enforceable against the
    Company, to the benefits provided for under Sections 4.1, 4.2
    and 4.3 of the Plan upon satisfaction of the applicable
    conditions specified in those Sections.

         9.2  Employment Status.  Prior to a Change in Control,
    each Eligible Employee shall continue in his or her status as
    an employee-at-will and the Plan does not constitute a
    contract of employment or impose on the Employer any
    obligation to (a) retain the Participant, (b) make any
    payments upon termination of employment, (c) change the
    status of the Participant's employment or (d) change any
    employment policies of the Employer.

         9.3  Notice.  For the purposes of the Plan, notices and
    all other communications provided for in the Plan (including
    the Notice of Termination) shall be in writing and shall be
    deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or
    sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
    prepaid, addressed to the respective addresses last given by
    each party to the other, provided that all notices to the
    Company and/or the Employer shall be directed to the
    attention of the Board with a copy to the Secretary of the
    Company.  All notices and communications shall be deemed to
    have been received on the date of delivery thereof or on the
    third business day after the mailing thereof, except that
    notice of change of address shall be effective only upon
    receipt.

         9.4  Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as provided in
    Section 4.4, nothing in the Plan shall prevent or limit the
    Participant's continuing or future participation in any
    benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided
    by the Company and/or the Employer for which the Participant
    may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or reduce such
    rights as the Participant may have under any other agreements
    with the Company and/or the Employer.  Amounts which are
    vested benefits or which the Participant is otherwise
    entitled to receive under any plan or program of the Company
    and/or the Employer shall be payable in accordance with such
    plan or program, except as explicitly modified by the Plan.
    No additional compensation provided under any benefit or
    compensation plans to the Participant shall be deemed to
    modify or otherwise affect the terms of the Plan or any of
    the Participant's entitlements hereunder.

         9.5  Settlement of Claims.  The Company's obligation to
    make the payments provided for in the Plan and otherwise to
    perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by
    any circumstances, including without limitation, any set-off,
    counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the
    Company and/or the Employer may have against the Participant
    or others.

         9.6  Trust.  All benefits under the Plan shall be paid
    by the Company.  The Plan shall be unfunded and the benefits
    hereunder shall be paid only from the general assets of the
    Company; provided, however, notwithstanding anything
    contained in the Plan to the contrary, nothing herein shall
    prevent or prohibit the Company from establishing a trust or
    other arrangement for the purpose of providing for the
    payment of the benefits payable under the Plan.

         9.7  Waiver or Discharge.  No provision of the Plan may
    be waived or discharged unless such waiver or discharge is
    agreed to in writing and signed by the Participant, the
    Company and the Employer.  No waiver by either the Company,
    the Employer or any Participant at any time of any breach by
    either the Company, the Employer or any Participant of, or
    compliance with, any condition or provision of the Plan to be
    performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of
    similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or
    at any prior or subsequent time.

         9.8  Governing Law.  THE VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION,
    CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PLAN SHALL IN ALL
    RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
    ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT GIVING
    EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF; PROVIDED,
    HOWEVER, THAT IN ANY ACTION INVOLVING A PARTICIPANT, THE
    COMPANY AND/OR THE EMPLOYER WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OR
    ASSERTION THAT THE PARTICIPANT'S EMPLOYMENT WAS PROPERLY
    TERMINATED FOR CAUSE, THE COMPANY AND/OR THE EMPLOYER HAS THE
    BURDEN OF PROVING THAT THE PARTICIPANT'S EMPLOYMENT WAS
    PROPERLY TERMINATED FOR CAUSE.

         9.9  Validity and Severability.  The invalidity or
    unenforceability of any provision of the Plan shall not
    affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
    of the Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect, and
    any prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
    not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
    other jurisdiction.

         9.10  Legal Fees.  Following a Change in Control, the
    Company shall pay all legal fees and related expenses
    (including the costs of experts, evidence and counsel)
    incurred by the Participant as they become due as a result of
    (a) the Participant's termination of employment (including
    all such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in contesting or
    disputing any such termination of employment), or (b) the
    Participant's seeking to obtain or enforce any right or
    benefit provided by the Plan (including any such fees and
    expenses incurred in connection with the Dispute) or by any
    other plan or arrangement maintained by the Company and/or
    Employer under which the Participant is or may be entitled to
    receive benefits; provided however, that the circumstances
    set forth in clauses (a) and (b) (other than as a result of
    the Participant's termination of employment under
    circumstances described in Section 2.6(d)) occurred on or
    after a Change in Control; provided, further, however, in the
    event a court finally determines that the claim by the
    Participant for which legal fees were incurred and paid by
    the Company pursuant to this Section 9.10 was frivilous, the
    Company shall be reimbursed by the Participant for any legal
    fees paid under this Section 9.10 in respect of such
    frivilous claim.

         9.11  Forum.  Any suit brought by a Participant under
    the Plan may be brought in the appropriate state or federal
    court for Tarrant County, Texas, or for the county wherein
    the Participant maintains his or her residence.  Any suit
    brought by the Company and/or Employer under the Plan may
    only be brought in the county wherein the Participant
    maintains his or her residence, unless the Participant
    consents to suit elsewhere.

                   [TANDY CORPORATION LETTERHEAD]

                                       Date:



    [NAME]
    [Address]

    Dear [Name]:

         The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Tandy
    Corporation (the "Company") believes that the future threat
    or occurrence of a "Change in Control" (as defined in the
    Appendix) of the Company may cause you undue concern for your
    financial security and distract your attention from the
    operations of our businesses, which would be detrimental to
    the Company and its shareholders.

         In recognition of these concerns and notwithstanding
    anything contained in your Compensation Plan letter to the
    contrary, the Board has determined that in order to provide
    you with some measure of security in the event of a Change in
    Control of the Company, it has authorized the Company to
    agree as follows:

         The term of this letter agreement shall commence as of
    the date hereof and shall continue in effect for a period of
    at least 24 months; provided, however, that commencing on the
    first anniversary date hereof and each anniversary date
    thereafter the term shall be automatically extended for an
    additional 12 months unless the Company shall have given
    written notice to you at least 90 days prior thereto that the
    term of this letter agreement shall not be so extended;
    provided, further, however, that upon a Change in Control
    this letter agreement shall in no event be terminated prior
    to the complete and full satisfaction by the Company (or any
    successor thereto) of its obligations as set forth herein.

         For any fiscal year during which you are in the employ
    of the Company on the date of the occurrence of a Change in
    Control (the "Change in Control Year"), you hereby are
    guaranteed an annual bonus for the Change in Control Year
    (the "Change in Control Bonus") in an amount no less than the
    highest annual bonus that was paid or payable to you for any
    fiscal year during the three (3) full fiscal years ended
    prior to a Change in Control (the "Bonus Amount") provided
    that you are in the employ of the Company (or its successor)
    on the last day of the Change in Control Year.

         The Change in Control Bonus will be paid to you in cash
    within forty-five (45) business days (or earlier, if required
    by law) following the last day of the Change in Control Year
    whether or not you are in the employ of the Company (or its
    successor) on the date of payment.

         For the most recently ended fiscal year prior to the
    occurrence of a Change in Control (the "Prior Fiscal Year")
    for which your annual bonus has not yet been determined, you
    hereby are guaranteed an annual bonus for the Prior Fiscal
    Year equal to the Bonus Amount provided that you are in the
    employ of the Company on the last day of the Prior Fiscal
    Year.  In the event that your annual bonus for the Prior
    Fiscal Year has been determined but not yet paid upon the
    occurrence of a Change in Control, you hereby are guaranteed
    an annual bonus for the Prior Fiscal Year in the amount
    determined but unpaid prior to the occurrence of a Change in
    Control.  The payment for the Prior Fiscal Year as set forth
    in this paragraph will be paid to you in cash within
    forty-five (45) days of the end of the Prior Fiscal Year but
    in no event more than thirty (30) days following the date of
    the occurrence of a Change in Control (or earlier, if
    required by law), whether or not you are in employ of the
    Company (or its successor) on the date of payment.

                                     Sincerely,



                                     [Name]
                                     [Title]

    ATTEST:

    <PAGE>

                               APPENDIX
         Change in Control.  For purposes of this Letter
    Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall mean any of the
    following events:

    (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of
    any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting
    Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person is used for
    purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) immediately after
    which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
    meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided,
    however, that in determining whether a Change in Control has
    occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a
    "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
    constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in
    Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an
    acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a trust
    forming a part thereof) maintained by (x) the Company or (y)
    any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its
    voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is
    owned directly or indirectly by the Company (a "Subsidiary"),
    (2) the Company or any Subsidiary, or (3) any Person in
    connection with a "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter
    defined).

    (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990, are members
    of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any reason to
    constitute at least two-thirds of the Board; provided,
    however, that if the election, or nomination for election by
    the Company's stockholders, of any new director was approved
    by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Board, such
    new director shall, for purposes of this Letter Agreement, be
    considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; provided
    further, however, that no individual shall be considered a
    member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially
    asssumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened
    "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated
    under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

    (c)  Approval by stockholders of the Company of:

         (1)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization involving
         the Company, unless

              (i)  the stockholders of the Company, immediately
              before such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization, own, directly or indirectly
              immediately following such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization, at least sixty percent (60%) of the
              combined voting power of the outstanding voting
              securities of the corporation resulting from such
              merger or consolidation or reorganization (the
              "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the same
              proportion as their ownership of the Voting
              Securities immediately before such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization,

              (ii)  the individuals who were members of the
              Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution
              of the agreement providing for such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization constitute at least
              two-thirds of the members of the board of directors
              of the Surviving Corporation,

              (iii)  no Person (other than the Company, any
              Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan (or any trust
              forming a part thereof) maintained by the Company,
              the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary, or any
              Person who, immediately prior to such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial
              Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
              then outstanding Voting Securities) has Beneficial
              Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
              combined voting power of the Surviving
              Corporation's then outstanding voting securities,
              and

              (iv)  a transaction described in clauses (i)
              through (iii) shall herein be referred to as a
              "Non-Control Transaction";

         (2)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of the
         Company; or

         (3)  An agreement for the sale or other disposition of
         all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to
         any Person (other than a transfer to a Subsidiary).

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not
    be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject
    Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the
    permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a
    result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company
    which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
    Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
    any additional Voting Securities which increases the
    percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in
    Control shall occur.

    (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Letter
    Agreement to the contrary, if your employment is terminated
    following the date hereof but within one (1) year prior to a
    Change in Control and you reasonably demonstrate that such
    termination (i) was at the request of a third party who has
    indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably calculated
    to effect a Change in Control and who effectuates a Change in
    Control (a "Third Party") or (ii) otherwise occurred in
    connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in Control
    which actually occurs, then for all purposes of this Letter
    Agreement, the date of a Change in Control with respect to
    you shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such
    termination of your employment.

                TO PARTICIPANTS WITH DISCRETIONARY BONUS



                   [TANDY CORPORATION LETTERHEAD]

                                  Date:



    [NAME]
    [Address]

    Dear [Name]:

         The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Tandy
    Corporation (the "Company") believes that the future threat
    or occurrence of a "Change in Control" (as defined in the
    Appendix) of the Company may cause you undue concern for your
    financial security and distract your attention from the
    operations of our businesses, which would be detrimental to
    the Company and its shareholders.

         In recognition of these concerns and notwithstanding
    anything contained in your [Compensation Plan letter] to the
    contrary, the Board has determined that in order to provide
    you with some measure of security in the event of a Change in
    Control of the Company, it has authorized the Company to
    agree as follows:

         The term of this letter agreement shall commence as of
    the date hereof and shall continue in effect for a period of
    at least 24 months; provided, however, that commencing on the
    first anniversary date hereof and each anniversary date
    thereafter the term shall be automatically extended for an
    additional 12 months unless the Company shall have given
    written notice to you at least 90 days prior thereto that the
    term of this letter agreement shall not be so extended;
    provided, further, however, that upon a Change in Control
    this letter agreement shall in no event be terminated prior
    to the complete and full satisfaction by the Company (or any
    successor thereto) of its obligations as set forth herein.

         For any fiscal year during which you are in the employ
    of the Company on the date of the occurrence of a Change in
    Control (the "Change in Control Year"), you hereby are
    guaranteed an annual bonus for the Change in Control Year
    (the "Change in Control Bonus") in an amount no less than the
    annual bonus that was paid or payable to you for the most
    recently ended fiscal year prior to the occurrence of a
    Change in Control (the "Prior Fiscal Year") provided that you
    are in the employ of the Company (or its successor) on the
    last day of the Change in Control Year.

         The Change in Control Bonus will be paid to you in cash
    within forty-five (45) business days (or earlier, if required
    by law) following the last day of the Change in Control Year
    whether or not you are in the employ of the Company (or its
    successor) on the date of payment.

         For the Prior Fiscal Year, if your annual bonus has not
    been determined upon the occurence of a Change in Control,
    you hereby are guaranteed an annual bonus for the Prior
    Fiscal Year equal to the annual bonus paid or payable to you
    for the fiscal year which ended before the Prior Fiscal Year,
    provided that you are in the employ of the Company on the
    last day of the Prior Fiscal Year.  In the event that your
    annual bonus for the Prior Fiscal Year has been determined
    but not yet paid upon the occurrence of a Change in Control,
    you hereby are guaranteed an annual bonus for the Prior
    Fiscal Year in the amount determined but unpaid prior to the
    occurrence of a Change in Control.  The payment for the Prior
    Fiscal Year as set forth in this paragraph will be paid to
    you in cash within forty-five (45) days of the end of the
    Prior Fiscal Year but in no event more than thirty (30) days
    following the date of the occurrence of a Change in Control
    (or earlier, if required by law), whether or not you are in
    employ of the Company (or its successor) on the date of
    payment.

                                 Sincerely,



                                 [Name]

         Change in Control.  For purposes of this Letter
    Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall mean any of the
    following events:

    (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of
    any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting
    Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person is used for
    purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) immediately after
    which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
    meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided,
    however, that in determining whether a Change in Control has
    occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a
    "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
    constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in
    Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an
    acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a trust
    forming a part thereof) maintained by (x) the Company or (y)
    any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its
    voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is
    owned directly or indirectly by the Company (a "Subsidiary"),
    (2) the Company or any Subsidiary, or (3) any Person in
    connection with a "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter
    defined).

    (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990, are members
    of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any reason to
    constitute at least two-thirds of the Board; provided,
    however, that if the election, or nomination for election by
    the Company's stockholders, of any new director was approved
    by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Board, such
    new director shall, for purposes of this Letter Agreement, be
    considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; provided
    further, however, that no individual shall be considered a
    member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially
    asssumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened
    "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated
    under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or 

    (c)  Approval by stockholders of the Company of:

         (1)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization involving
         the Company, unless

              (i)  the stockholders of the Company, immediately
              before such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization, own, directly or indirectly
              immediately following such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization, at least sixty percent (60%) of the
              combined voting power of the outstanding voting
              securities of the corporation resulting from such
              merger or consolidation or reorganization (the
              "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the same
              proportion as their ownership of the Voting
              Securities immediately before such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization,

              (ii)  the individuals who were members of the
              Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution
              of the agreement providing for such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization constitute at least
              two-thirds of the members of the board of directors
              of the Surviving Corporation,

              (iii)  no Person (other than the Company, any
              Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan (or any trust
              forming a part thereof) maintained by the Company,
              the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary, or any
              Person who, immediately prior to such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial
              Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
              then outstanding Voting Securities) has Beneficial
              Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
              combined voting power of the Surviving
              Corporation's then outstanding voting securities,
              and

              (iv)  a transaction described in clauses (i)
              through (iii) shall herein be referred to as a
              "Non-Control Transaction";

         (2)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of the
         Company; or 

         (3)  An agreement for the sale or other disposition of
         all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to
         any Person (other than a transfer to a Subsidiary).

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not
    be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject
    Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the
    permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a
    result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company
    which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
    Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
    any additional Voting Securities which increases the
    percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in
    Control shall occur.

    (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Letter
    Agreement to the contrary, if your employment is terminated
    following the date hereof but within one (1) year prior to a
    Change in Control and you reasonably demonstrate that such
    termination (i) was at the request of a third party who has
    indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably calculated
    to effect a Change in Control and who effectuates a Change in
    Control (a "Third Party") or (ii) otherwise occurred in
    connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in Control
    which actually occurs, then for all purposes of this Letter
    Agreement, the date of a Change in Control with respect to
    you shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such
    termination of your employment.

                     TO PARTICIPANTS IN PAY PLAN



                   [TANDY CORPORATION LETTERHEAD]




                                   Date:

    [NAME]
    [Address]

    Dear [Name]:

         The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Tandy
    Corporation (the "Company") believes that the future threat
    or occurrence of a "Change in Control" (as defined in the
    Appendix) of the Company may cause you undue concern for your
    financial security and distract your attention from the
    operations of our businesses, which would be detrimental to
    the Company and its shareholders.

         In recognition of these concerns and notwithstanding
    anything contained in your [Pay Plan letter] to the contrary,
    the Board has determined that in order to provide you with
    some measure of security in the event of a Change in Control
    of the Company, it has authorized the Company to agree as
    follows:

         The term of this letter agreement shall commence as of
    the date hereof and shall continue in effect for a period of
    at least 24 months; provided, however, that commencing on the
    first anniversary date hereof and each anniversary date
    thereafter the term shall be automatically extended for an
    additional 12 months unless the Company shall have given
    written notice to you at least 90 days prior thereto that the
    term of this letter agreement shall not be so extended;
    provided, further, however, that upon a Change in Control
    this letter agreement shall in no event be terminated prior
    to the complete and full satisfaction by the Company (or any
    successor thereto) of its obligations as set forth herein.

         For any fiscal year during which you are in the employ
    of the Company on the date of the occurrence of a Change in
    Control (the "Change in Control Year"), you hereby are
    guaranteed an annual bonus for the Change in Control Year
    (the "Change in Control Bonus") in an amount no less than the
    bonus that would be payable to you for a full fiscal year
    under the Pay Plan as in effect on the date of the Change in
    Control (the "Bonus Amount") provided that you are in the
    employ of the Company (or its successor) on the last day of
    the Change in Control Year.

         The Change in Control Bonus will be paid to you in cash
    within forty-five (45) business days (or earlier, if required
    by law) following the last day of the Change in Control Year
    whether or not you are in the employ of the Company (or its
    successor) on the date of payment.

         For the most recently ended fiscal year prior to the
    occurrence of a Change in Control (the "Prior Fiscal Year")
    for which your annual bonus has not yet been determined, you
    hereby are guaranteed an annual bonus for the Prior Fiscal
    Year equal to the Bonus Amount provided that you are in the
    employ of the Company on the last day of the Prior Fiscal
    Year.  In the event that your annual bonus for the Prior
    Fiscal Year has been determined but not yet paid upon the
    occurrence of a Change in Control, you hereby are guaranteed
    an annual bonus for the Prior Fiscal Year in the amount
    determined but unpaid prior to the occurrence of a Change in
    Control.  The payment for the Prior Fiscal Year as set forth
    in this paragraph will be paid to you in cash within
    forty-five (45) days of the end of the Prior Fiscal Year but
    in no event more than thirty (30) days following the date of
    the occurrence of a Change in Control (or earlier, if
    required by law), whether or not you are in employ of the
    Company (or its successor) on the date of payment.

                                    Sincerely,



                                    [Name]

                               APPENDIX


    Change in Control.  For purposes of this Letter Agreement, a
    "Change in Control" shall mean any of the following events:

    (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of
    any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting
    Securities") by any "Person" (as the term person is used for
    purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) immediately after
    which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
    meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided,
    however, that in determining whether a Change in Control has
    occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a
    "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
    constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in
    Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an
    acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a trust
    forming a part thereof) maintained by (x) the Company or (y)
    any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its
    voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is
    owned directly or indirectly by the Company (a "Subsidiary"),
    (2) the Company or any Subsidiary, or (3) any Person in
    connection with a "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter
    defined).

    (b)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1990, are members
    of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for any reason to
    constitute at least two-thirds of the Board; provided,
    however, that if the election, or nomination for election by
    the Company's stockholders, of any new director was approved
    by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Board, such
    new director shall, for purposes of this Letter Agreement, be
    considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; provided
    further, however, that no individual shall be considered a
    member of the Incumbent Board if such individual initially
    asssumed office as a result of either an actual or threatened
    "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11 promulgated
    under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

    (c)  Approval by stockholders of the Company of:

         (1)  A merger, consolidation or reorganization involving
         the Company, unless

              (i)  the stockholders of the Company, immediately
              before such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization, own, directly or indirectly
              immediately following such merger, consolidation or
              reorganization, at least sixty percent (60%) of the
              combined voting power of the outstanding voting
              securities of the corporation resulting from such
              merger or consolidation or reorganization (the
              "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the same
              proportion as their ownership of the Voting
              Securities immediately before such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization,

              (ii)  the individuals who were members of the
              Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution
              of the agreement providing for such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization constitute at least
              two-thirds of the members of the board of directors
              of the Surviving Corporation,

              (iii)  no Person (other than the Company, any
              Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan (or any trust
              forming a part thereof) maintained by the Company,
              the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary, or any
              Person who, immediately prior to such merger,
              consolidation or reorganization had Beneficial
              Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
              then outstanding Voting Securities) has Beneficial
              Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
              combined voting power of the Surviving
              Corporation's then outstanding voting securities,
              and

              (iv)  a transaction described in clauses (i)
              through (iii) shall herein be referred to as a
              "Non-Control Transaction";

         (2)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of the
         Company; or 

         (3)  An agreement for the sale or other disposition of
         all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to
         any Person (other than a transfer to a Subsidiary).

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not
    be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject
    Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the
    permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a
    result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company
    which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
    Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
    any additional Voting Securities which increases the
    percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in
    Control shall occur.

    (d)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Letter
    Agreement to the contrary, if your employment is terminated
    following the date hereof but within one (1) year prior to a
    Change in Control and you reasonably demonstrate that such
    termination (i) was at the request of a third party who has
    indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably calculated
    to effect a Change in Control and who effectuates a Change in
    Control (a "Third Party") or (ii) otherwise occurred in
    connection with, or in anticipation of, a Change in Control
    which actually occurs, then for all purposes of this Letter
    Agreement, the date of a Change in Control with respect to
    you shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of such
    termination of your employment.

                       INDEMNITY AGREEMENT

         AGREEMENT, as of ____________ ___, 1991, (the
    "Agreement"), between Tandy Corporation, a Delaware
    corporation (the "Company"), and _________________________
    (the "Indemnitee").

         WHEREAS, it is essential to the Company to retain and
    attract as directors and officers the most capable persons
    available;

         WHEREAS, Indemnitee is a director and/or an officer of
    the Company;

         WHEREAS, both the Company and Indemnitee recognize the
    increased risk of litigation and other claims being asserted
    against directors and officers of public companies in today's
    environment;

         WHEREAS, the Bylaws of the Company require the Company
    to indemnify and advance expenses to its directors and
    officers to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the
    Indemnitee has been serving and continues to serve as a
    director and/or an officer of the Company in part in reliance
    on such Bylaws;

         WHEREAS, in recognition of Indemnitee's need for
    substantial protection against personal liability in order to
    enhance Indemnitee's continued service to the Company in an
    effective manner and Indemnitee's reliance on the aforesaid
    Bylaws, and in part to provide Indemnitee with specific
    contractual assurance that the protection promised by such
    Bylaws will be available to Indemnitee (regardless of, among
    other things, any amendment to or revocation of such Bylaws
    or other things, any amendment to or revocation of such
    Bylaws or any change in the composition of the Company's
    Board of Directors or acquisition transaction relating to the
    Company), the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for
    the indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to
    Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law and as set
    forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent insurance is
    maintained, for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under
    the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance
    policies;

         NOW, THEREFOR, in consideration of the premises and of
    Indemnitee continuing to serve the Company directly or, at
    its request, with another enterprise, and intending to be
    legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

              (i)  An acquisition (other than directly from the
    Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting
    Securities") by a "Person" (as the term person is used for
    purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities xchange
    Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")) immediately after
    which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the
    meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act) of
    fifteen percent (15%) or more of the combined voting power of
    the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities; provided,
    however, that in determining whether a Change in Control has
    occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a
    "Non-Control Acquisition" (as hereinafter defined) shall not
    constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in
    Control.  A "Non-Control Acquisition" shall mean an
    acquisition by (1) an employee benefit plan (or a trust
    forming a part thereof) maintained by (x) the Company or (y)
    any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its
    voting power or its equity securities or equity interest is

    connection with a "Non-Control Transaction" (as hereinafter
    defined).

              (ii)  The individuals who, as of August 22, 1991,
    are members of the Board (the "Incumbent Board"), cease for
    any reason to constitute at least two-thirds of the Board;
    provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for
    election by the Company's stockholders, of any new director
    was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
    Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of
    this Agreement, be considered as a member of the Incumbent
    Board; provided further, however, that no individual shall be
    considered a member of the Incumbent Board if such individual
    initially assumed office as a result of either an actual or
    threatened "Election Contest" (as described in Rule 14a-11
    promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened
    solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a
    Person other than the Board (a "Proxy Contest") including by
    reason of any agreement intended to avoid or settle any
    Election Contest or Proxy Contest; or

              (iii)  Approval by stockholders of the Company of:

                   (A)  a merger or consolidation involving the

    immediately before such merger, consolidation or
    reorganization, own, directly or indirectly immediately
    following such merger, consolidation or reorganization, at
    least sixty percent (60%) of the combined voting power of the
    outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting
    from such merger or consolidation or reorganization (the
    "Surviving Corporation") in substantially the same proportion
    as their ownership of the Voting Securities immediately
    before such merger, consolidation or reorganization,

                        (2)  the individuals who were members of
    the Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the
    agreement prior to the execution of the agreement providing

    of the Surviving Corporation,

                        (3)  no Person (other than the Company,
    any Subsidiary, any employee benefit plan (or any trust
    forming a part thereof) maintained by the Company, the
    Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary, or any Person who,
    immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or
    reorganization had Beneficial Ownership of fifteen percent
    (15%) or more of the then outstanding Voting Securities) has
    Beneficial Ownership of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
    combined voting power of the Surviving Corporation's then
    outstanding voting securities, and

                        (4)  a transaction described in clauses
    (1) through (3) shall herein be referred to as a "Non-Control
    Transaction;"

                   (B)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of
    the Company; or

                   (C)  An agreement for the sale or other
    disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
    Company to any Person (other than a transfer to a
    Subsidiary).

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not
    be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject
    Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the
    permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a
    result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company
    which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities
    outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a
    Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this
    sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities
    by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the
    Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of
    any additional Voting Securities which increases the
    percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities
    Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in
    Control shall occur.

         (b)  Claim: any threatened, pending or completed action,
    suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
    or investigative or other, including, without limitation, an
    action by or in the right of any other corporation of any
    type or kind, domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint
    venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
    whether predicated on foreign, federal, state or local law
    and whether formal or informal.

         (c)  Expenses: include attorney's fees and all other
    costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection
    with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
    participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to
    defend, be a witness in or participate in any Claim relating
    to any Indemnifiable vent.

         (d)  Indemnifiable vent: any event or occurrence related
    to the fact that Indemnitee is or was or has agreed to become
    a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the
    Company, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve in any
    capacity, at the request of the Company, in any other
    corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit
    plan, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of anything
    done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity.

         (e)  Potential Change in Control: shall be deemed to
    have occurred if (i) the Company enters into an agreement or
    arrangement, the consummation of which would result in the
    occurrence of a Change in Control; or (ii) the Board adopts a
    resolution to the effect that, for purposes of this
    Agreement, a Potential Change in Control has occurred.

         (f)  Voting Securities: any securities of the Company
    which vote generally in the election of directors.

    2.  Basic Indemnification Arrangement:

         (a)  In the event Indemnitee was, is or becomes a party
    to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be
    made a party to or witness or other participant in, a Claim
    by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable
    vent, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee (without regard
    to the negligence or other fault of the Indemnitee) to the
    fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as soon as
    practicable but in no event later than thirty days after
    written demand is presented to the Company, against any and
    all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes and
    amounts paid or to be paid in settlement (including all
    interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
    connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments,
    fines, penalties, excise taxes or amounts paid or to be paid
    in settlement) of such Claim.  If Indemnitee makes a request
    to be indemnified under this Agreement, the Board of
    Directors (acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are
    not parties to the Claim with respect to an Indemnifiable
    Event or, if such a quorum is not obtainable, acting upon an
    opinion in writing of independent legal counsel ("Board
    Action") shall, as soon as practicable but in no event later
    than thirty days after such request, authorize such
    indemnification.  Notwithstanding anything in the Restated
    Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Certificate
    of Incorporation"), the Bylaws of the Company or this
    Agreement to the contrary, following a Change in Control,
    Indemnitee shall, unless prohibited by law, be entitled to
    indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in connection with
    any Claim initiated by Indemnitee.

         (b)  Notwithstanding anything in the Certificate of
    Incorporation, the Bylaws or this Agreement to the contrary,
    if so requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance
    (within two business days of such request) any and all
    expenses relating to a Claim to Indemnitee (an "xpense
    Advance"), upon the receipt of a written undertaking by or on
    behalf of Indemnitee to repay such Expense Advance if a
    judgment or other final adjudication adverse to Indemnitee
    (as to which all rights or appeal therefrom have been
    exhausted or lapsed) establishes that Indemnitee, with
    respect to such Claim, is not eligible for indemnification.

         (c)  Notwithstanding anything in the Certificate of
    Incorporation, the Bylaws or in this Agreement to the
    contrary, if Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings in a
    court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination
    that Indemnitee should be indemnified under this Agreement,
    the Bylaws of the Company or applicable law, any Board Action
    or Arbitration (as defined in Section 3) that Indemnitee
    would not be permitted to be indemnified in accordance with
    Section 2(a) of this Agreement shall not be binding.  If
    there has been no Board Action or Arbitration, or if Board
    Action or Arbitration determines that Indemnitee would not be
    permitted to be indemnified, in any respect, in whole or in
    part, in accordance with Section 2(a) of this Agreement,
    Indemnitee shall have the right to commence litigation in the
    court which is hearing the action or proceeding relating to
    the Claim for which indemnification is sought or in any court
    in the States of Delaware or Texas having subject matter
    jurisdiction thereof and in which venue is proper seeking an
    initial determination by the court or challenging any such
    Board Action or Arbitration or any aspect thereof, and the
    Company thereby consents to service of process and to appear
    in any such proceeding.  Any Board Action not followed by
    Arbitration or such litigation, and any Arbitration not
    followed by such litigation, shall be conclusive and binding
    on the Company and Indemnitee.

    3.  Change in Control.  The Company agrees that if there is a
    Change in Control, Indemnitee, by giving written notice to
    the Company and the American Arbitration Association (the
    "Notice"), may require that any controversy or claim arising
    out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof,
    shall be settled by arbitration (the "Arbitration"), in Fort
    Worth, Texas, in accordance with the Rules of the American
    Arbitration Association (the "Rules").  The Arbitration shall
    be conducted by a panel of three arbitrators selected in
    accordance with the Rules within thirty days of delivery of
    the Notice.  The decision of the panel shall be made as soon
    as practicable after the panel has been selected, and the
    parties agree to use their reasonable efforts to cause the
    panel to deliver its decision within ninety days of its
    selection.  The Company shall pay all fees and expenses of
    the Arbitration.  The Arbitration shall be conclusive and
    binding on the Company and Indemnitee and Indemnitee may
    cause judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators to
    be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof;
    provided, however, that any Arbitration shall have no effect
    on Indemnitee's right to commence litigation pursuant to
    Section 2(c) of this Agreement, in which case, such
    Arbitration shall not be conclusive and binding on Indemnitee
    or the Company.

    4.  Establishment of Trust.  In the event of a Potential
    Change in Control or a Change in Control, the Company shall,
    promptly upon written request by Indemnitee, create a Trust
    for the benefit of Indemnitee and from time to time, upon
    written request of Indemnitee to the Company, shall fund such
    Trust in an amount, as set forth in such request, sufficient
    to satisfy any and all Expenses reasonably anticipated at the
    time of each such request to be incurred in connection with
    investigating, preparing for and defending any claim relating
    to an Indemnifiable Event, and any and all judgments, fines,
    penalties and settlement amounts of any and all Claims
    relating to an Indemnifiable vent from time to time actually
    paid or claimed, reasonably anticipated or proposed to be
    paid.  The terms of the Trust shall provide that upon a
    Change in Control (i) the Trust shall not be revoked or the
    principal thereof invaded, without the written consent of
    Indemnitee; (ii) the Trustee shall advance, within two
    business days of a request by Indemnitee, any and all
    Expenses to Indemnitee, not advanced directly by the Company
    to Indemnitee (and Indemnitee hereby agrees to reimburse the
    Trust under the circumstances under which Indemnitee would be
    required to reimburse the Company under Section 2(b) of this
    Agreement); (iii) the Trust shall continue to be funded by
    the Company in accordance with the funding obligation set
    forth above; (iv) the Trustee shall promptly pay to
    Indemnitee all amounts for which Indemnitee shall be entitled
    to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise;
    and (v) all unexpended funds in such Trust shall revert to
    the Company upon a final determination by Board Action or
    Arbitration or a court of competent jurisdiction, as the case
    may be, that Indemnitee has been fully indemnified under the
    terms of this Agreement.  The Trustee shall be chosen by
    Indemnitee.  Nothing in this Section 4 shall relieve the
    Company of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

    5.  Indemnification for Additional Expenses.  The Company
    shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all expenses
    (including attorneys' fees) and, if requested by Indemnitee,
    shall (within two business days of such request) advance such
    expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in
    connection with any claim asserted by or action brought by
    Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or advance payment of
    Expenses by the Company under this Agreement or any other
    agreement or Company Bylaw now or hereafter in effect
    relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events and/or (ii)
    recovery under any directors' and officers' liability
    insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of
    whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to
    such indemnification, advance expense payment or insurance
    recovery, as the case may be.

    6.  Partial Indemnity, Etc.  If Indemnitee is entitled, under
    any provisions of this Agreement to indemnification by the
    Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments,
    fines, penalties, excise taxes and amounts paid or to be paid
    in settlement of a Claim but not, however, for all of the
    total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless
    indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which
    Indemnitee is entitled.  Moreover, notwithstanding any other
    provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee
    has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of
    any or all Claims relating in whole or in part to an
    Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter
    therein, including, without limitation, dismissal without
    prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against any and
    all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes and
    amounts paid or to be paid in settlement of such Claim.  In
    connection with any determination by Board Action,
    Arbitration or a court of competent jurisdiction that
    Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the
    burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that
    Indemnitee is not so entitled.

    7.  No Presumption.  For purposes of this Agreement, the
    termination of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, by
    judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court
    approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere,
    or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that
    Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or
    have any particular belief or that a court has determined
    that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law or
    this Agreement.

    8.  Contribution.  In the event that the indemnification
    provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee
    for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of
    indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount
    incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines,
    penalties, excise taxes, amounts paid or to be paid in
    settlement and/or for expenses, in connection with any Claim
    relating to an Indemnifiable Event, in such proportion as is
    deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the
    circumstances of such action by Board Action or Arbitration
    or by the court before which such action was brought in order
    to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company
    and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or
    transaction(s) giving cause to such action; and/or (ii) the
    relative fault of the Company (and its other directors,
    officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection
    with such event(s) and/or transaction(s).  Indemnitee's right
    to contribution under this Paragraph 8 shall be determined in
    accordance with, pursuant to and in the same manner as, the
    provisions in Paragraphs 2 and 3 hereof relating to
    Indemnitee's right to indemnification under this Agreement.

    9.  Notice to the Company by Indemnitee.  Indemnitee agrees
    to promptly notify the Company in writing upon being served
    with or having actual knowledge of any citation, summons,
    complaint, indictment or any other similar document relating
    to any action which may result in a claim of indemnification
    or contribution hereunder.

    10.  Non-exclusivity, Etc.  The rights of the Indemnitee
    hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee
    may have under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or
    Bylaws or the Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise,
    and nothing herein shall be deemed to diminish or otherwise
    restrict Indemnitee's right to indemnification under any such
    other provision.  To the extent applicable law or the
    Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of Company, is in
    effect on the date hereof or at any time in the future,
    permit greater indemnification than as provided for in this
    Agreement, the parties hereto agree that Indemnitee shall
    enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by
    such law or provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or
    Bylaws and this Agreement shall be deemed amended without any
    further action by the Company or Indemnitee to grant such
    greater benefits.  Indemnitee may elect to have Indemnitee's
    rights hereunder interpreted on the basis of applicable law
    in effect at the time of execution of this Agreement, at the
    time of the occurrence of the Indemnifiable Event giving rise
    to a Claim or at the time indemnification is sought.

    11.  Liability Insurance.  To the extent the Company
    maintains at any time an insurance policy or policies
    providing directors' and officers' liability insurance,
    Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in
    accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of
    the coverage available for any other Company director or
    officer under such insurance policy.  The purchase and
    maintenance of such insurance shall not in any way limit or
    affect the rights and obligations of the parties hereto, and
    the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall not in any
    way be construed to limit or affect the rights and
    obligations of the Company and/or of the other parties under
    any such insurance policy.

    12.  Period of Limitations.  No legal action shall be brought
    and no cause of action shall be asserted by or on behalf of
    the Company or any affiliate of the Company against
    Indemnitee, Indemnitee's spouse, heirs, executors or personal
    or legal representatives after the expiration of two years
    from the date of accrual of such cause of action, and any
    claim or cause of action of the Company or its affiliate
    shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by
    the timely filing of a legal action within such two-year
    period; provided, however, that if any shorter period of
    limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of
    action such shorter period shall govern.

    13.  Amendments, Etc.  No supplement, modification or
    amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed
    in writing by both of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any
    of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
    constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether
    or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing
    waiver.

    14.  Subrogation.  In the event of payment under this
    Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of
    such payment to all of the rights of recovery with respect to
    such payment of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers
    required and shall do everything that may be necessary to
    secure such rights, including the execution of such documents
    necessary to enable to Company effectively to bring suit to
    enforce such rights.

    15.  No-Duplication of Payments.  The Company shall not be
    liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection
    with any claim made against Indemnitee to the extent
    Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (under any
    insurance policy, Bylaw or otherwise) of the amounts
    otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

    16.  Binding Effect, tc.  This Agreement shall be binding
    upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable against
    and by the parties hereto and their respective successors,
    assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by
    purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or
    substantially all of the business and/or assets of the
    Company), spouses, heirs and personal and legal
    representatives.  The Company shall require and cause any
    successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger,
    consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a
    substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the
    Company, by written agreement in form and substance
    satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to
    perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
    extent that the company would be required to perform if no
    such succession had taken place.  This Agreement shall
    continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues
    to serve as a director and/or officer of the Company or of
    any other enterprise at the Company's request.

    17.  Severability.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be
    severable in the event that any of the provisions thereof
    (including any provision within a single section, paragraph
    or sentence) are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
    be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, and the
    remaining provisions shall remain enforceable to the fullest
    extent permitted by law.

    18.  Notices.  All notices, requests, demands and other
    communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in
    writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
    delivered by hand or when mailed by certified registered
    mail, return receipt requested, with postage prepaid:


              A.  If to Indemnitee, to:

                  ___________________________________

    or to such other person or address which Indemnitee shall
    furnish to the Company in writing pursuant to the above.


              B.  If to the Company, to:

                  Tandy Corporation
                  1800 One Tandy Center

    or to such person or address as the Company shall furnish to
    Indemnitee in writing pursuant to the above.

    19.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and
    construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
    State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be
    performed in such State without giving effect to the
    principles of conflicts of laws.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly
    executed and delivered this Agreement as of the 26th day of
    August, 1991.

    (a)  Series B dividends for the year ended December 31, 1993
         are not net of income tax benefits associated with
         unallocated shares in the TESOP in accordance with EITF
         Issue No. 92-3.

    (b)  Effect of mandatory conversion of Series C preferred
         stock for the six months ended December 31, 1992 and the
         year ended June 30, 1992 have been restated to reflect
         the common shares issuable at the closing market at
         December 31, 1993 of $49.40.
    (c)  This calculation is submitted in accordance with
         Regulation S-K, Item 601(b)(11) although not required by
         footnote 2 to paragraph 14 of APB Opinion No. 15
         because it results in dilution of less than 3%.
    (d)  For the year ended December 31, 1993 and the six months
         ended December 31, 1992 these items are anti- dilutive
         and thus are omitted from the calculation.
