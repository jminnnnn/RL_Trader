PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL
RadioShack Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1967. We primarily engage
in the  retail  sale of  consumer  electronic  goods and  services  through  our
RadioShack store chain. Our strategy is to dominate cost-effective  solutions to
meet everyone's  routine  electronics needs and families'  distinct  electronics
wants.  Throughout  this report,  the terms  "our," "we," "us" and  "RadioShack"
refer to RadioShack Corporation, including its subsidiaries.

Company-Operated  Stores: At December 31, 2004, we operated 5,046 company stores
located  throughout  the United  States,  as well as in Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin  Islands.  These stores are located in major malls and strip centers,  as
well as individual storefronts. Each location carries a broad assortment of both
private label and third-party branded consumer electronics products. Our product
lines include  wireless  phones and  communication  devices such as scanners and
two-way   radios;   residential   telephones,   DVD   players,   computers   and
direct-to-home ("DTH") satellite systems; home entertainment,  wireless, imaging
and computer accessories; general and special purpose batteries; wire, cable and
connectivity  products;  and digital  cameras,  radio-controlled  cars and other
toys,  satellite radios,  memory players and wellness products.  We also provide
consumers access to third-party  services such as cellular and PCS phone and DTH
satellite  activation,  satellite radio service,  prepaid  wireless  airtime and
extended service plans.

Dealer  Outlets:  At December  31,  2004,  we also had a network of 1,788 dealer
outlets,  including 45 located outside of the U.S. These outlets provide private
label and third-party branded products and services to smaller communities.  The
dealers are  generally  engaged in other  retail  operations  and augment  their
businesses with our products and service offerings. Our sales derived outside of
the United States are not material.

Company-Operated  Kiosks:  At December 31, 2004, we operated 599 kiosks  located
throughout  the United  States.  These  kiosks are  primarily  inside SAM'S CLUB
locations,  as  well  as  in  major  malls.  These  locations,   which  are  not
RadioShack-branded,  offer  product  lines  including  wireless  telephones  and
associated accessories. We also provide consumers access to third-party cellular
and PCS phone services.

Retail Support Operations.  Our retail stores,  along with our kiosks and dealer
outlets,  are supported by an  established  infrastructure.  Below are the major
components of this support structure:

     RadioShack Global Sourcing ("RSGS") - RSGS serves our wide-ranging
     international import/export, sourcing, evaluation, logistics and quality
     control needs. While the majority of RSGS's activities support our
     business, RSGS also provides services for outside customers.

     Consumer Electronics Manufacturing - We operate three manufacturing
     facilities in the United States and one overseas manufacturing operation in
     the Asia-Pacific region. These four manufacturing facilities employed
     approximately 2,400 employees as of December 31, 2004. We manufacture a
     variety of products, primarily sold through our retail outlets, including
     telephony, antennas, wire and cable products, and a wide variety of "hard
     to find" parts and accessories for consumer electronics products.

     RadioShack.com - Products, services and information are available through
     our Web site www.radioshack.com. Online customers can purchase, return or
     exchange products available through this Web site either online or at their
     neighborhood RadioShack location.

     RadioShack Customer Support - Using state-of-the-art telephone systems, Web
     self-help guides and data networks, RadioShack Customer Support responds to
     more than 3.2 million phone calls and emails annually. The responses
     include answers to customers' unique requests for hard-to-find parts,
     batteries and accessories, customer service inquiries and direct sales
     requests related to our Web site and retail stores.

     RadioShack Service Centers - We maintain a service and support network to
     service the consumer electronics and personal computer retail industry in
     the U.S. At December 31, 2004, we had 15 RadioShack service centers in the
     U.S. and one in Puerto Rico that repair name brand and private label
     products sold through various sales channels. We are also a vendor-
     authorized service provider for third parties such as Compaq, Sony,
     Hewlett-Packard, RCA/Thomson, Kyocera, Nokia, Samsung, ATC Logistics &
     Electronics and LG Electronics, among others. In addition, we perform
     repairs for third-party service centers and extended service plan
     providers.
<PAGE>

     RadioShack Technology Services ("RSTS") - Our management information system
     architecture is composed of a distributed, online network of computers that
     links all stores, customer channels, delivery locations, service centers,
     credit providers, distribution facilities and our home office into a fully
     integrated system. Each store has its own server to support the
     point-of-sale ("POS") system. The majority of our company stores
     communicate through a broadband network, which provides efficient access to
     customer support data. This design also allows store management to track
     sales and/or inventory at the product, customer or sales associate level.
     RSTS provides the majority of our programming and systems analysis needs.

     Distribution Centers - We have eight distribution centers that ship over
     one million cartons each month to our retail stores and dealer outlets.
     Two of these distribution centers also serve as fulfillment centers for our
     online customers.

SEASONALITY
As with most other retailers,  our net sales and operating  revenues,  operating
income  and cash flows are  proportionally  greater  during  the winter  holiday
season  than  during  other  periods  of  the  year.  There  is a  corresponding
pre-seasonal  inventory build-up,  which requires working capital related to the
anticipated increased sales volume. This is described in more detail below under
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations"  ("MD&A") in the section  titled  "Cash Flow and  Liquidity."  Also,
refer to Note 25 of the "Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements"  for our
quarterly data, which shows  seasonality  trends.  We expect such seasonality to
continue.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
We own or are licensed to use many  trademarks  and service marks related to our
business   in  the  United   States  and  in  foreign   countries.   RadioShack,
RadioShack.com,  and "You've got questions.  We've got answers." are some of the
marks most widely used by us. We believe that the RadioShack  name and marks are
well  recognized  by consumers and that the name and marks are  associated  with
high-quality  products  and  services.  We also  believe  that  the  loss of the
RadioShack  name and  RadioShack  marks  would  have a  material  impact  on our
business.  Our private label manufactured  products are sold primarily under the
RadioShack  trademark.  We also own  various  patents  and  patent  applications
relating to electronic products sold by RadioShack.

SUPPLIERS AND BRANDED RELATIONSHIPS
Our business strategy depends,  in part, upon our ability to offer private label
and  third-party  branded  products,  as well as  third-party  services,  to our
customers.  We utilize a large number of suppliers  located in various  parts of
the world to obtain raw  materials  and  private  label  merchandise.  We do not
expect a lack of  availability  of raw  materials  or any single  private  label
product to have a material impact on our  operations.  We have formed vendor and
third-party service provider  relationships with well-recognized  companies and,
in the aggregate,  certain of these relationships are important to our business;
the loss of or  disruption  in supply  from  these  relationships  could  have a
material adverse effect on our net sales and operating  revenues.  Additionally,
we have been limited from time to time by various vendors and suppliers strictly
on an economic basis, where demand has exceeded supply. In the aggregate,  these
relationships  have or are  expected  to have a  significant  impact on both our
operations  and financial  strategy.  Our vendor and  third-party  relationships
include  companies  such as Sprint PCS,  Verizon  Wireless,  Echo Star Satellite
Corporation (DISH Network), Hewlett-Packard Company and Sirius Radio.

ORDER BACKLOG
We have no material backlog of orders for the products or services that we sell.

COMPETITION
Due to rising  consumer  demand for wireless  products and services,  as well as
rapid  consumer  acceptance  of new digital  technology  products,  the consumer
electronics retail business continues to be highly competitive, primarily driven
by technology and product cycles.

In the consumer  electronics  retailing  business,  competitive  factors include
price,   product   availability,   quality  and  features,   consumer  services,
manufacturing  and distribution  capability,  brand reputation and the number of
competitors.  We compete in the sale of our products  and services  with several
retail formats.  Consumer  electronics  retailers  include both Circuit City and
Best Buy.  Department  and specialty  stores,  such as Sears and The Home Depot,
compete on a more  select  product  category  scale.  Sprint,  Verizon and other
wireless  providers  compete  directly  with us in the wireless  phone  category
through their own retail and online  presence.  Mass merchants such as Wal-Mart,
Target and other  alternative  channels of distribution,  such as mail order and
e-commerce  retailers,  compete  with us on a more  widespread  basis.  Numerous
domestic and foreign  companies also  manufacture  products  similar to ours for
other  retailers,  which are sold  under  nationally-recognized  brand  names or
private labels.
<PAGE>

Management  believes we have three primary factors  differentiating  us from our
competition.  First is our extensive physical retail presence with approximately
7,400 convenient  retail locations in virtually every  neighborhood  nationwide.
Second, our specially trained sales staff is capable of providing cost-effective
solutions for our customers' routine electronics needs and distinct  electronics
wants,  assisting  customers  with  service  activation,  when  applicable,  and
assisting with the selection of appropriate  products and accessories.  Third is
our proven ability to accelerate the adoption rate of new technologies.

While  we  believe  we have an  effective  business  strategy,  we  cannot  give
assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future, given the
highly competitive nature of the consumer electronics retail business.  Also, in
light of the ever-changing  nature of the consumer  electronics retail industry,
we would be  adversely  affected  if our  competitors  were able to offer  their
products at  significantly  lower  prices.  Additionally,  we would be adversely
affected if our competitors were able to introduce innovative or technologically
superior  products  not yet  available  to us,  or if we were  unable  to obtain
certain  products  in a  timely  manner  or  for an  extended  period  of  time.
Furthermore,  our  business  would  be  adversely  affected  if we fail to offer
value-added  solutions or if our  competition  enhances their ability to provide
these value-added solutions.

EMPLOYEES
As of December  31,  2004,  we had  approximately  42,000  employees,  including
temporary seasonal employees. Approximately 9,400 temporary employees, hired for
the holiday selling season,  remained at year end. Our employees are not covered
by collective  bargaining  agreements,  nor are they members of labor unions. We
consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

1934, as amended, and its rules and regulations. The Exchange Act requires us to

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
Information  on our  properties is located in MD&A and the financial  statements
included in this Form 10-K and is  incorporated  into this Item 2 by  reference.
The following items are discussed further on the referenced pages:

We lease, rather than own, most of our retail and service center facilities. Our
stores are located primarily in major shopping malls,  stand-alone  buildings or
shopping centers owned by other entities.  We lease two distribution  centers in
the United States and six administrative  offices and one manufacturing plant in
the Asia-Pacific region. We own the property on which the other six distribution
centers and three manufacturing facilities are located within the United States.
We beneficially  own all of the property on which our new corporate  offices are
located in downtown Fort Worth, Texas. This land is currently held on our behalf
by a local  development  agency operated by the City of Fort Worth to facilitate
various incentive programs provided by the city.

RETAIL OUTLETS
The table below shows our retail locations broken down between  company-operated
stores, kiosks and dealer outlets.

(1)  Over the past two years, we have closed over 100  company-operated  stores,
     net of  new  store  openings  and  relocations.  This  trend  is due to not
     renewing  locations that fail to meet our financial  return hurdles.  It is
     anticipated that  company-operated  stores will decline in 2005 by about 50
     stores.

(2)  Kiosks consist of 546 SAM'S CLUB  locations and 53 Sprint  locations at the
     end of 2004 and 9 Sprint  locations  at year end 2003.  SAM'S  CLUB has the
     unconditional  right to assume  the  operation  of up to 75  locations  (in
     total) and to date has provided us with notice that,  effective April 2005,
     SAM'S CLUB will assume operation of 23 kiosk locations  previously operated
     by us. We expect the number of Sprint  kiosks to increase by  approximately
     150 during 2005.

(3)  Over the past two years, we have closed over 250 dealer outlets, net of new
     outlet openings or conversion to company-operated stores. This trend is due
     to the closure of smaller outlets that failed to meet our minimum  purchase
     requirements. It is anticipated that dealer outlets in 2005 will not change
     materially from 2004.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
We are  currently a party to various  class  action  lawsuits  alleging  that we
misclassified  certain  RadioShack  store  managers as exempt  from  overtime in
violation of the Fair Labor  Standards Act,  including a lawsuit styled Alphonse
L. Perez, et al. v. RadioShack Corporation,  filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  While the alleged damages in these
lawsuits are  undetermined,  they could be substantial.  We believe that we have
meritorious defenses, and we are vigorously defending these cases.  Furthermore,
we fully expect these cases to be  favorably  determined  as a matter of federal
law. If,  however,  an adverse  resolution of any of these lawsuits  occurs,  we
believe they could have a material  adverse  effect on our results of operations
for the year in which resolution occurs. However, we do not believe that such an
adverse  resolution  would have a material impact on our financial  condition or
liquidity.  The  liability,  if any,  associated  with  these  lawsuits  was not
determinable at December 31, 2004.

We have various other pending  claims,  lawsuits,  disputes with third  parties,
investigations and actions incidental to the operation of our business. Although
occasional  adverse  settlements or resolutions may occur and negatively  impact
earnings  in the  period or year of  settlement,  it is our  belief  that  their
ultimate  resolution  will not have a material  adverse  effect on our financial
condition or liquidity.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
No  matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders  during the fourth
quarter of 2004.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ("MD&A").

This MD&A  section  discusses  our  results  of our  operations,  liquidity  and
financial  condition,  risk  management  practices and certain  factors that may
affect our future results, including economic and industry-wide factors, as well
as our  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates.  You should read MD&A in

OVERVIEW
RadioShack is primarily a retailer of consumer electronics and services. We seek
to  differentiate   ourselves  from  our  various  competitors  by  focusing  on
dominating cost-effective solutions to meet everyone's routine electronics needs
and  families'  distinct  electronics  wants.  This  strategy  allows us to take
advantage of the unique opportunities provided by our extensive retail presence,
knowledgeable  sales staff, and relationships with reputable vendors. We believe
this strategy  provides us with the  opportunity to increase our market share in
the highly competitive  consumer  electronics area. In addition,  we continue to
focus on methods to reduce the costs of products  sold and selling,  general and
administrative  expense as a  percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues.
Furthermore,  we believe that by focusing on  opportunities  such as  innovative
products,  new  markets,   licensing  opportunities  and  creative  distribution
channels,  we can  ultimately  generate  increased  financial  returns  for  our
shareholders over the long term.

We have identified two key  opportunities to drive company growth,  which are in
alignment with our overall  strategy  described above. We are focusing on growth
of our core business,  which includes our company-operated  stores,  dealers and
our Web site  www.radioshack.com,  as well as businesses  that we consider to be
close to our core  strengths,  which  includes  retail  services,  international
operations and consumer electronics repairs.

With  respect to our core  business,  our  strategy is to enhance our brands and
customer  experiences in our stores.  We are  accomplishing  this by focusing on
improvement of our product assortment, store personnel and store environment. In
order to improve our product assortment, we are customizing key stores by market
area, with the goal of providing  products that are tailored to the customers of
that  particular  market.  We  are  also  focusing  on  high-performing  product
categories,  while  de-emphasizing  other product categories that have had lower
historical performances. In addition, we are attempting to identify technologies
that we believe we can grow, based on our established  ability to accelerate the
adoption  rate of new  technologies.  With  respect to store  personnel,  we are
enhancing our training,  compensation and store operating procedures,  including
our  receiving,  labor  scheduling  and  hours of  operation.  Finally,  we have
improved our store  environment by rolling out an updated store format to nearly
300 more stores in 2004.  We intend to  accelerate  this  roll-out  in 2005.  In
addition,  we make  continuous  enhancements  to our store  format as stores are
rolled out.

We are also focusing on businesses  that are  considered to be close to our core
strengths.  This  close-to-core  strategy includes expanding our retail services
business,  recognizing  innovative  product  channels  and  opportunities,   and
identifying   international  expansion  opportunities.   In  order  to  identify
innovative  product  channels  and  opportunities,  we are  focusing on creating
innovative   relationships   with  key  parties  such  as  vendors  and  product
developers,  utilizing new channels,  and  obtaining  intellectual  property and
licensing rights to innovative products.

In 2004, we  significantly  expanded our retail services  business by purchasing
the  wireless  kiosks in SAM'S  CLUB.  During the fourth  quarter of fiscal year
2004, we acquired  wireless  kiosk  fixtures and inventory  located within SAM'S
CLUB retail  locations,  as well as certain  other assets and  liabilities  from
Wireless Retail,  Inc. ("WRI").  The total purchase price was $59.1 million.  In
conjunction  with  this  transaction,  we  received  cash and  commitments  from
wireless carriers of $40.3 million.  Regarding our SAM'S CLUB operations, we pay
rent for the use of the  kiosk  area  within  SAM'S  CLUB  locations,  and while
utilizing our own employees, POS system, and store fixtures.
<PAGE>

Another component of our retail services business is our Sprint kiosk locations,
which are Sprint-branded and are located in malls. At these locations,  which we
staff,  we sell Sprint  wireless  hardware  and related  accessories.  We have a
profit-sharing  and  working-capital  arrangement  with Sprint  related to these
locations.  We expect to continue to identify  additional  opportunities  in our
overall retail services business in 2005.

KEY INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR MANAGEMENT
To identify our progress in achieving our solutions strategy, we use several key
financial  performance  metrics,  including  net  sales and  operating  revenues
metrics, gross margin metrics, and selling,  general and administrative ("SG&A")
expense and operating margin metrics.

Net Sales and Operating Revenues Metrics

As a  retailer,  we  consider  growth in  revenue to be a key  indicator  of our
overall  financial  performance.  We examine  our  revenue by using  several key
metrics, including overall change in net sales and operating revenue, comparable
company  store sales  growth,  average  tickets per store and average  sales per
ticket.

The  change in net sales  and  operating  revenue  provides  us with an  overall
indication of the demand for our products and services. Comparable company store
sales  growth  indicates  the extent to which  sales were  impacted by growth in
existing sales channels. Comparable company store sales include the sales of any
domestic,  retail  location  where  we  have  a  physical  presence,   including
company-operated  stores  and  kiosks,  that has  more  than 12 full  months  of
recorded sales. Average tickets per store, in conjunction with average sales per
ticket,  provide us with an  indication  of whether the changes in revenues were
generated by a higher  volume of  purchases  or by  purchases  of products  with
higher prices.

The table below summarizes these revenue metrics for the years indicated:

                                           2004      2003      2002
                                         --------  --------  --------
Net sales and operating revenues growth    4.1%      1.6%     (4.2%)
Comparable store sales growth               3%        2%       (1%)
Average tickets per store per day           66        72        73
Average sales per ticket                  $34.17    $30.77    $29.40

In addition to the metrics  above,  we review the revenue per square foot of our
various  channels  of  distribution  to  determine  productivity  of our product
assortment and the overall distribution channel.

Gross Margin Metrics

We also view our gross margin as a key metric of our financial  performance,  as
it  indicates  the extent to which we are able to reduce our  product  costs and
optimize product mix.

The table below summarizes gross margin for the years indicated:

                                           2004      2003      2002
                                         --------  --------  --------
Gross margin                               50.3%     49.8%     48.9%

SG&A Expense and Operating Margin Metrics

We believe that our ability to leverage our fixed expense base and, accordingly,
increase operating margin is an important indicator of our financial performance
and process efficiency.

The table below summarizes these metrics for the years indicated:

                                           2004      2003      2002
                                         --------  --------  --------
SG&A expense as a percentage of sales      36.7%     37.4%     37.8%
Operating margin                           11.5%     10.4%      9.3%

RETAIL OUTLETS
The table below shows our retail locations broken down between  company-operated
stores,  kiosks  and  dealer  outlets.  While  the  dealer  outlets  represented
approximately  24% of RadioShack's  total retail locations at December 31, 2004,
our  product  sales to  dealers  are less  than 10% of our  total  net sales and
operating revenues (see "Results of Operations" below).

                                     Average           At December 31,

(1)  Over the past two years, we have closed over 100  company-operated  stores,
     net of  new  store  openings  and  relocations.  This  trend  is due to not
     renewing  locations that fail to meet our financial  return hurdles.  It is
     anticipated that  company-operated  stores will decline in 2005 by about 50
     stores.

(2)  Kiosks consist of 546 SAM'S CLUB  locations and 53 Sprint  locations at the
     end of 2004 and 9 Sprint  locations  at year end 2003.  SAM'S  CLUB has the
     unconditional  right to assume  the  operation  of up to 75  locations  (in
     total) and to date has provided us with notice that,  effective April 2005,
     SAM'S CLUB will assume operation of 23 kiosk locations  previously operated
     by us. We expect the number of Sprint  kiosks to increase by  approximately
     150 during 2005.

(3)  Over the past two years, we have closed over 250 dealer outlets, net of new
     outlet openings or conversion to company-operated stores. This trend is due
     to the closure of smaller outlets that failed to meet our minimum  purchase
     requirements. It is anticipated that dealer outlets in 2005 will not change
     materially from 2004.

2004 COMPARED WITH 2003

NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES

Sales increased 4.1% to $4,841.2  million in 2004 from $4,649.3 million in 2003.
We had a 3% increase in comparable  company store sales.  These  increases  were
primarily  the result of a 22.5%  increase in our wireless  platform  sales.  An
increase in average  store volume and the addition of 590 kiosk  locations  also
contributed to our overall sales  increase.

Dealer and other sales,  which include sales to our dealer outlets,  in addition
to retail support  operations and other sales, were up $6.5 million for 2004, or
an  increase  of 2.1%,  when  compared  to 2003.  Sales  to our  dealers  remain
substantially less than 10% of our total sales.  Revenue from our retail support
operations,  service plans and other sales is generated  primarily  from outside
sales of our repair centers and domestic and overseas manufacturing, in addition
to our e-commerce  revenue.  The increase in these sales in 2004 was primarily a
result of our restructuring of our extended service  contract,  partially offset
due to the  disposition of RadioShack  Installation  Services  ("AmeriLink")  in
September  2003.

Sales in our  wireless  platform  (which  is made up of  wireless  handsets  and
communication  devices such as scanners and two-way radios) increased in dollars
and as a  percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues in 2004  compared to
2003.  This sales increase was due to both an increase in wireless  handset unit
sales and an increase in the revenue per wireless handsets. Emphasis on national
carrier  service and product  offerings  with  desirable  product  features  and
content,  such as color screens and cameras also drove the favorable results. We
anticipate sales in the wireless platform will increase for 2005, primarily as a
result of a full year of SAM'S CLUB kiosk sales and the planned expansion of our
Sprint  kiosks.

Sales  in  our  accessory   platform  (which   includes   accessories  for  home
entertainment  products,   wireless  handsets,   digital  imaging  products  and
computers,  as well as residential  phones and power)  decreased in both dollars
and as a percentage  of net sales and  operating  revenues in 2004,  compared to
2003.  The decrease in this platform  resulted  primarily from a decline in home
entertainment  accessories,  mostly  offset by increases  in wireless  power and
digital imaging accessories.

Sales in our modern home platform (which consists of residential telephones, all
home audio and video end-products, and direct-to-home ("DTH") satellite systems,
as well as desktop, laptop and handheld computers) decreased in both dollars and
as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues in 2004,  compared to 2003.
These decreases were primarily due to a sales decrease in DTH satellite systems,
audio  products and cordless  telephones,  as well as a planned  decrease in DTH
installation  revenue resulting from our sale of AmeriLink.

Sales in our personal  electronics  platform  (which includes  digital  cameras,
camcorders,  toys,  wellness  products,  memory  players and  satellite  radios)
increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating  revenues in
2004,  compared  to 2003.  These  increases  were  driven  primarily  by a sales
increase in digital imaging products, memory players and the introduction of our
satellite radio offering.

Sales  in our  power  platform  (which  includes  general  and  special  purpose
batteries  and battery  chargers)  decreased  slightly in both  dollars and as a
percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2004,  compared to 2003. These
declines  were  primarily  the  result of a sales  decline  in  special  purpose
batteries and battery chargers; however, the decline was substantially offset by
a sales increase in general purpose  batteries.

Sales in our service  platform (which includes prepaid  wireless  airtime,  bill
payment  revenue  and  warranty  service  plans)  decreased  in dollars and as a
percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2004,  compared to 2003. These
decreases  were  primarily due to a decrease in  wireless-related  services.
<PAGE>

Sales in our technical  platform  (which  includes wire and cable,  connectivity
products,  components  and tools,  as well as hobby and  robotic  end  products)
decreased  in both  dollars  and as a  percentage  of net  sales  and  operating
revenues in 2004,  compared to 2003.  These  decreases  were  primarily due to a
sales decline in wire and cable products and the related connectivity  products.


GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit for 2004 was $2,434.5  million or 50.3% of net sales and  operating
revenues,  compared  with  $2,315.7  million or 49.8% of net sales and operating
revenues in 2003,  resulting  in a 5.1%  increase in gross profit and a 50 basis
point increase in our gross profit  percentage.  These  increases over the prior
year  were  primarily  due to  significantly  less  margin  erosion  from  price
markdowns;  we sold over 40% less in  discontinued  and devalued  merchandise in
2004 versus the prior year. In addition, the benefits of centralized procurement
and better vendor management  enabled us to sell like-products year over year at
higher gross margins.

These  increases  were  partially  offset by a change in  merchandise  mix among
platforms,  resulting  in  increased  sales of lower  margin  products,  notably
wireless, and decreased sales of higher margin products like accessories.

</TABLE>

Our SG&A expense  increased  2.0% in dollars,  but decreased as a percent of net
sales and operating revenues to 36.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004, from
37.4% for the year ended  December  31, 2003.  The dollar  increase for 2004 was
primarily due to an increase in both payroll and commissions and advertising.
<PAGE>

Payroll expense increased in dollars, but decreased as a percentage of net sales
and operating  revenues.  This dollar increase was due to the higher sales-based
compensation we paid as a result of our 3% increase in company  comparable store
sales,  as well as our acquisition of the SAM'S CLUB kiosk locations and related
personnel in October 2004. We expect payroll  expense to increase in 2005 due to
the full-year effect of the acquisition of the SAM'S CLUB kiosk business and our
planned increase in the number of Sprint kiosk locations.

Advertising  expense increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and
operating  revenues.  This  increase  is  primarily  related to an  increase  in
expenditures  associated  with the  holiday  selling  season.  Additionally,  we
received fewer contributions from our vendors. We expect our advertising expense
to  increase in 2005 in dollars but  decrease as a  percentage  of net sales and
operating revenues, as a result of increased sales from our kiosk operations and
an improvement in operating efficiencies.

Rent expense  increased in dollars,  but decreased as a percent of net sales and
operating revenues.  The dollar increase was due primarily to lease renewals and
relocations at higher rates,  as well as the acquisition of the SAM'S CLUB kiosk
business in October 2004. We expect an increase in 2005 rent expense,  primarily
as a result of the full-year  effect of the  acquisition of the SAM'S CLUB kiosk
business and Sprint kiosk expansion.

Insurance  expense  decreased  in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and
operating  revenues,  as a result of both fewer  claims  and a  decrease  in the
number of participants in our insurance programs.  Our insurance expense relates
to  losses,  claims  and  insurance  premiums,  which  are  partially  offset by
contributions from health insurance participants.

In 2005,  we expect SG&A  expense to increase in dollars,  due to the  full-year
effect of our  acquisition  of the SAM'S CLUB  kiosk  business  and our  planned
Sprint kiosk  expansion.  We anticipate a slight decrease as a percentage of net
sales and operating  revenues,  due to anticipated  increased sales volume and a
continued focus on leveraging our fixed expense base.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

Depreciation and amortization  expense  increased $9.4 million dollars to $101.4
million and increased to 2.1% of net sales and operating  revenues,  compared to
2.0% for 2003. The increase in  depreciation  was primarily  attributable to new
store fixtures for existing company-operated stores, as well as the hardware and
software  associated with information  systems upgrades.  We expect depreciation
and  amortization  expense to increase by at least 10% in 2005 due to  increases
associated  with our new  corporate  headquarters,  which  is now  substantially
complete  and  occupied,  increased  spending  for our  store  remodel  program,
information system projects,  and the amortization of intangibles related to our
SAM'S CLUB kiosk business acquisition.

GAIN ON CONTRACT TERMINATION

There was no gain on contract  termination in 2004. For information on the prior
year gain on contract  termination,  see the discussion  below under the section
titled "2003 Compared with 2002."

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

There  was  no  significant   impairment  of  long-lived  assets  in  2004.  For
information  on  the  prior  year  impairment  of  long-lived  assets,  see  the
discussion below under the section titled "2003 Compared with 2002."

NET INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $18.2  million for 2004 versus
$22.9 million for 2003, a decrease of $4.7 million or 20.5%.

Interest expense  decreased to $29.6 million in 2004 from $35.7 million in 2003.
This  decrease  was  primarily  the result of a reduction  in the  average  debt
outstanding  throughout 2004. In addition, the capitalization of $6.6 million of
interest  expense related to the  construction of our new corporate  campus also
lowered  overall  interest  expense for the year ended  December 31, 2004,  when
compared to the same prior year period.

Interest income decreased  approximately 11% to $11.4 million in 2004 from $12.8
million in 2003, despite an increase in investment rates. This was primarily the
result of a $1.3 million  decrease in interest  received from tax settlements in
2004 compared to 2003, as well as a lower average investment balance.
<PAGE>

Interest  expense,  net of interest income, is expected to increase by more than
$6 million in 2005, when compared to 2004, due to the elimination of capitalized
interest  expense as a result of the substantial  completion of the construction
of our corporate headquarters.

OTHER INCOME, NET

During the year ended  December  31,  2004,  we received  payments  and recorded
income  of  $2.0  million  under  our  tax  sharing  agreement  with  O'Sullivan
Industries Holdings, Inc. ("O'Sullivan"),  compared to $3.1 million received and
recorded in the corresponding  prior year period.  Future payments under the tax
sharing  agreement will vary based on the level of O'Sullivan's  future earnings
and are also dependent on O'Sullivan's  overall financial  condition and ability
to pay. We cannot give any  assurances as to the amount or frequency of payment,
if any, that we may receive from O'Sullivan in future periods.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

Our  provision for income taxes  reflects an effective  income tax rate of 37.8%
for 2004 and 36.9% for 2003.  The increase in the  effective  tax rate for 2004,
when compared to 2003, was the result of a favorable tax settlement during 2003,
relating to prior year tax matters.  We  anticipate  that the effective tax rate
for 2005 will be approximately 38.2%.

2003 COMPARED WITH 2002

NET SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES

Sales  increased  approximately  1.6% to $4,649.3  million in 2003 from $4,577.2
million in 2002. We had a 2% increase in comparable  company store sales.  These
sales  increases  were possible  because of an increase in average store volume,
despite a decrease in 2003 of 40 company stores, net of store openings.

Sales  to  our  dealer  outlets  and  other  sales,   including  retail  support
operations,  were down for 2003,  when  compared  to 2002.  Sales to our  dealer
outlets remained  substantially less than 10% of our total sales. Retail support
operation  sales  were  generated  primarily  from  outside  sales of our repair
centers,  AmeriLink,  and domestic and overseas  manufacturing.  The decrease in
retail support operations sales from 2003 to 2002 was primarily the result of an
overall decline in our AmeriLink commercial  installation  business, the closure
of several of our manufacturing facilities in the third quarter of 2003, and the
sale of AmeriLink in September 2003.

Sales in our wireless  platform  increased in dollars and as a percentage of net
sales and operating revenues in 2003,  compared to 2002. This sales increase was
due  primarily  to an  increase  in the average  selling  price of our  wireless
handsets as a result of our continued  emphasis on national  carrier service and
product  offerings with desirable  product  features and content,  such as color
screens and cameras.

Sales in our  accessory  platform  increased  in  dollars,  but  decreased  as a
percentage of net sales and operating  revenues in 2003,  compared to 2002.  The
dollar  increase in this  platform was primarily the result of increases in both
wireless power and imaging  accessories sales, but partially offset by a decline
in sales of residential telephone and home entertainment accessories.

Sales in our modern home platform  decreased in both dollars and as a percentage
of net sales and operating  revenues in 2003,  compared to 2002. These decreases
were  primarily  due to decreased  sales of satellite  dishes and their  related
installation services, in addition to desktop CPUs and monitors.

Sales  in our  personal  electronics  platform  increased  in  dollars  and as a
percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2003,  compared to 2002. These
increases  were  driven  primarily  by sales  increases  in digital  cameras and
camcorders,  micro  radio-controlled  cars  and,  to a lesser  extent,  wellness
products  sold under our  LifewiseTM  brand.  This sales  increase was partially
offset by decreased sales of educational toys.

Sales in our power platform increased in both dollars and as a percentage of net
sales and  operating  revenues in 2003,  compared  to 2002.  This sales gain was
primarily due to increased sales of general and special purpose batteries.

Sales in our service  platform  increased in dollars and as a percentage  of net
sales and operating  revenues in 2003,  compared to 2002.  These  increases were
primarily due to an increase in our wireless services sales.

Sales in our technical platform decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of
net sales and operating revenues in 2003, compared to 2002. These decreases were
primarily due to a decline in sales of bulk and packaged  wire, as well as sales
decreases for technical components and hobby products.

<PAGE>

GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit for 2003 was $2,315.7  million or 49.8% of net sales and  operating
revenues,  compared  with  $2,238.3  million or 48.9% of net sales and operating
revenues in 2002,  resulting  in a 3.5%  increase in gross profit and a 90 basis
point increase in our gross profit  percentage.  These  increases over the prior
year were primarily due to the following:

We  experienced  over $40.0  million in benefit from our supply chain vendor and
strategic pricing initiatives. In connection with these initiatives, we utilized
online reverse  auctions,  realized more favorable terms from vendors,  improved
the impact of markdowns,  priced our products more  appropriately,  and utilized
other techniques and incentives to optimize gross profit.

We also improved our  merchandise  mix within  platforms by increasing the sales
mix for many of our higher margin products, while managing the mix down for many
lower margin products.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

Our SG&A expense  increased  0.7% in dollars,  but decreased as a percent of net
sales and operating revenues to 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2003, from
37.8% for the year ended  December  31, 2002.  The dollar  increase for 2003 was
primarily due to an increase in both payroll and  commissions  and  advertising,
partially  offset by a litigation  charge in 2002 related to the settlement of a
class action lawsuit in California.

Payroll  expense  increased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and
operating  revenues in 2003, due primarily to an increase in incentive pay based
on increased earnings, as well as the 2.6% increase in company store sales.

Advertising  expense  increased in dollars and as a percentage  of net sales and
operating revenues in 2003. These increases related to an increase in television
advertising, as well as a decrease in contributions from vendors.

Rent expense  increased in dollars for 2003 due primarily to lease  renewals and
relocations at higher rates,  as well as a slight  increase in the average store
size. Rent expense as a percent of net sales and operating revenues remained the
same for 2003,  compared to 2002,  due to fewer company stores and our continued
rent reduction efforts.

Insurance  expense  increased  in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and
operating revenues in 2003, when compared to 2002.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

Depreciation  and amortization  expense  decreased $2.7 million dollars to $92.0
million and remained at 2.0% of net sales and  operating  revenues for both 2003
and 2002.

GAIN ON CONTRACT TERMINATION

RadioShack  and  Microsoft  mutually  agreed  during  2002  to  terminate  their
agreement  and settle the  remaining  commitments  each had to one another.  The
termination  of this agreement took effect at the start of the fourth quarter of
2002, upon satisfaction of several  contractual  obligations.  The net financial
result was an $18.5 million gain (principally  cash received),  driven primarily
by the settlement of a multi-year obligation Microsoft had to connect our stores
with broadband capabilities.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AmeriLink  was  acquired  in 1999 to  provide us with  residential  installation
capabilities for the technologies and services offered in our retail stores.  As
a result of continued  difficulties in the DTH business and a refocus during the
fourth quarter of 2002 on our satellite installation  strategy,  together with a
revised  cash  flow  projection  for  our  overall  installation   business,  we
determined that the remaining  long-lived  assets associated with AmeriLink were
impaired.  We compared the carrying value of these long-lived  assets with their
fair value and determined  that the remaining  goodwill  balance of $8.1 million
was impaired and we, therefore,  recorded an impairment charge of this amount in
the accompanying 2002 Consolidated Statement of Income. As of December 31, 2002,
there was no  remaining  goodwill  balance  on our  balance  sheet  relating  to
AmeriLink. We sold AmeriLink in September 2003.

<PAGE>

NET INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest  expense,  net of interest  income,  was $22.9  million for 2003 versus
$34.4 million for 2002, a decrease of $11.5 million or 33.4%.

Interest  expense  decreased to $35.7 million in 2003 from $43.4 million in 2002
primarily as a result of a reduction in the average debt outstanding  throughout
2003. In addition,  our interest rate swap instruments and the capitalization of
$2.6  million  of  interest  expense  related  to the  construction  of our  new
corporate  campus  also  lowered  overall  interest  expense  for the year ended
December 31, 2003, when compared to the same prior year period.

Interest income increased over 42% to $12.8 million in 2003 from $9.0 million in
2002, primarily as a result of a $5.6 million increase in interest received from
income tax settlements in 2003, as compared to 2002.

OTHER INCOME, NET

In July 2003, we received payment of $15.7 million  resulting from the favorable
settlement of a lawsuit we had previously  filed. We recorded this settlement in
the  third  quarter  of 2003 as  other  income  of $10.7  million,  net of legal
expenses of $5.0 million paid as a result of the lawsuit.

In September 2003 we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary AmeriLink to INSTALLS inc,
LLC in a  cash-for-stock  sale,  resulting in a loss of $1.8  million,  based on
AmeriLink's book value, which was recorded in other income.

For the year ended  December 31, 2003,  we received and recorded  income of $3.1
million owed to us under a tax sharing  agreement with  O'Sullivan,  compared to
$33.9 million received and recorded in the  corresponding  prior year period. In
the second quarter of 2002, we received and recorded  income of $27.7 million in
partial settlement of amounts owed to us under this tax sharing agreement.  This
partial  settlement  followed  a ruling  in our favor by an  arbitration  panel.
Future payments under the tax sharing  agreement will vary based on the level of
O'Sullivan's  future  earnings and are also  dependent on  O'Sullivan's  overall
financial condition and ability to pay.

During the second half of 2002,  we received two payments  totaling $6.2 million
relating to quarterly payments under the tax sharing agreement with O'Sullivan.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

Our  provision for income taxes  reflects an effective  income tax rate of 36.9%
for 2003 and 38.0% for 2002.  The decrease in the  effective  tax rate for 2003,
when compared to 2002, was the result of a favorable tax  settlement  related to
prior year tax matters.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2003, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (the "FASB") issued
revised FIN 46,  "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation
of  Accounting  Research  Bulletin  No. 51" ("FIN  46R").  FIN 46R  requires the
consolidation  of an entity in which an  enterprise  absorbs a  majority  of the
entity's expected losses,  receives a majority of the entity's expected residual
returns,  or both,  as a result of  ownership,  contractual  or other  financial
interests  in the entity  (variable  interest  entities or  "VIEs").  FIN 46R is
applicable  for financial  statements of public  entities that have interests in
VIEs or  potential  VIEs  referred to as  special-purpose  entities  for periods
ending after December 31, 2003.  Applications  by public  entities for all other
types of entities are required in financial  statements for periods ending after
March 15, 2004. The application of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our
results of operations,  financial  position or liquidity,  and does not apply to
our dealer outlets.

In December 2004, the FASB issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
("SFAS") No. 123R "Share-Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R establishes standards for
the  accounting  for  transactions  in  which an  entity  exchanges  its  equity
instruments  for  goods  or  services.   This  Statement  focuses  primarily  on
accounting  for  transactions  in which an entity obtains  employee  services in
share-based payment transactions.  SFAS No. 123R requires that the fair value of
such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical  financial
statements as services are performed. Prior to SFAS 123R, only certain pro forma
disclosures  of fair value were  required.  We will adopt the provisions of SFAS
No.  123R  beginning  with the  third  quarter  of 2005.  We intend to elect the
modified  prospective  transition  method,  which will require that we recognize
compensation  expense for all new and unvested  share-based  payment awards from
the  effective  date.  Based on our  preliminary  analysis of SFAS No. 123R,  we
anticipate the after-tax impact of adoption on our results of operations for the
six months ending  December 31, 2005, will be an expense of  approximately  $6.8
million.
<PAGE>

During fiscal year 2004, we adopted  Emerging  Issues Task Force  ("EITF") Issue
No.  03-10,  "Application  of Issue No. 02-16 by  Resellers to Sales  Incentives
Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,"  which amends EITF No. 02-16.  According
to the amended guidance, if certain criteria are met,  consideration received by
a reseller in the form of reimbursement  from a vendor for honoring the vendor's
sales incentives  offered directly to consumers (i.e.,  manufacturers'  coupons)
should not be recorded as a reduction  of the cost of the  reseller's  purchases
from the vendor.  The adoption of EITF No. 03-10 did not  materially  impact our
results of operations, financial position or liquidity in fiscal year 2004.

In November  2004,  the FASB issued  SFAS No.  151,  "Inventory  Costs." The new
Statement  amends  Accounting  Research  Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,  "Inventory
Pricing,"  to clarify  the  accounting  for  abnormal  amounts of idle  facility
expense,  freight,  handling costs, and wasted material.  SFAS 151 requires that
these items be recognized as current-period charges and requires that allocation
of fixed  production  overhead to the cost of  conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the  production  facilities.  This statement is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect adoption of this statement
to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY
A summary of cash flows from  operating,  investing and financing  activities is
outlined in the table below.

                          Year Ended December 31,
                       ----------------------------
(In millions)            2004      2003      2002
- -------------          --------  --------  --------
Operating activities   $ 352.5   $ 651.9   $ 521.6
Investing activities    (290.2)   (188.9)    (99.0)
Financing activities    (259.1)   (274.8)   (377.5)

Cash Flow - Operating Activities

In 2004,  cash flows  provided by  operating  activities  were  $352.5  million,
compared to $651.9 million and $521.6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

During the year ended  December  31,  2004,  increases  in accounts  receivable,
consisting  primarily  of amounts due from our various  vendors and  third-party
service  providers,  used  $53.0  million  in cash,  compared  to $17.2  million
provided  in the  prior  year.  An  increase  in  vendor  and  service  provider
receivables due to an increase in sales of wireless  services resulted in a cash
usage by accounts receivable in 2004, while cash provided in 2003 was the result
of reductions of vendor and service provider  receivables and dealer receivables
from increased collections and lower sales of satellite television hardware.

During the year ended  December  31, 2004,  increases  in inventory  used $234.2
million in cash,  compared to $202.3 million  provided during 2003. The increase
in inventory since December 31, 2003, was primarily the result of abnormally low
inventory  levels  during  the  holiday  selling  season of 2003 and  additional
inventory  purchased to stock the new kiosk locations  during the fourth quarter
of 2004.

Typically,  our annual cash  requirements  for pre-seasonal  inventory  build-up
range  between  $200  million and $400  million.  The funding  required for this
build-up comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and
operating  revenues.  We had $437.9  million in cash and cash  equivalents as of
December 31, 2004, as a resource for our funding  needs.  Additional  capital is
available  under our $600 million  dollar  commercial  paper  program,  which is
supported  by a bank  credit  facility  that could be  utilized in the event the
commercial  paper  market is  unavailable  to us. We currently do not expect the
commercial  paper market to become  unavailable  to us nor that; we will need to
utilize our credit facility. As of December 31, 2004, we had no commercial paper
outstanding, nor had we utilized any of our credit facility.

During  the year  ended  December  31,  2004,  $161.8  million  more in cash was
provided by accounts payable as a result of effective management of our payables
in 2004 and an increase in inventory levels, when compared to the prior year.
<PAGE>

Cash Flow - Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities in 2004 was $290.2 million, compared to $188.9
million  and  $99.0  million  used  in  2003  and  2002,  respectively.  Capital
expenditures  for  2004 and  2003  increased  over  2002,  primarily  due to the
continued  construction  of our new  corporate  campus in 2004 and  2003,  while
capital expenditures for 2002 were primarily for our retail store expansions and
remodels and  information  systems  upgrades.  We also had capital  expenditures
relating  to retail  stores and  information  systems in both 2004 and 2003.  We
anticipate  that  our  capital   expenditure   requirements  for  2005  will  be
approximately  $200.0 million to $240.0 million.  Although capital  expenditures
for 2005 will be about the same as 2004,  expenditures  will occur in  different
areas.  Company-operated  store remodels and relocations,  approximately 150 new
Sprint kiosks and updated  information  systems  account for the majority of our
anticipated  2005  capital  expenditures.  See  further  discussion  on our  new
corporate  headquarters  below in the  section  titled  "Capital  Structure  and
Financial Condition." During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired
certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Wireless Retail, Inc. ("WRI").
These assets included  wireless  kiosks and inventory  located within SAM'S CLUB
retail  locations.  The total  purchase  price was $59.1  million.  See  further
discussion  on our  SAM'S  CLUB  kiosk  business  above  in the  section  titled
"Overview."  As of December  31,  2004,  we had $437.9  million in cash and cash
equivalents. These cash and cash equivalents, along with cash generated from our
net sales and operating revenues and, if necessary,  from our credit facilities,
are available to fund future capital expenditure needs.

Cash Flow - Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities was $259.1 million in 2004, compared to $274.8
million  and  $377.5  million  in 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  We used  $251.1
million for the  repurchase  of our common stock in 2004 and $286.2  million and
$329.9  million  for the  repurchase  of our  common  stock  in 2003  and  2002,
respectively.  Repurchases of common stock were made under our share  repurchase
and employee stock programs.  See the further discussion of our stock repurchase
programs  below  in  the  section  titled   "Capital   Structure  and  Financial
Condition." The 2004, 2003 and 2002 stock  repurchases  were partially funded by
$85.8 million, $51.5 million and $49.6 million, respectively,  received from the
sale of  treasury  stock  to  employee  benefit  plans  and  from  stock  option
exercises.  The balance of capital to  repurchase  shares was obtained from cash
generated  from  operations.  We  received  $32.3  million  from  the  sale  and
lease-back of our former corporate  technology center building during the second
quarter of 2002. This transaction was recorded as a financing  obligation due to
responsibilities which we retain during the lease period. Additionally,  our net
borrowings  decreased  $54.1 million in 2004,  compared to a slight  increase in
2003 and a decrease of $89.7  million in 2002.  Dividends  paid,  net of tax, in
2004, 2003 and 2002 amounted to $39.7 million,  $40.8 million and $39.8 million,
respectively.  This  change  in  dividends  paid over the last  three  years was
affected  by a  dividend  per  share  increase  and  yearly  share  repurchases,
resulting in fewer shares outstanding.

Free Cash Flow

Our free cash  flow,  defined  as cash  flows  from  operating  activities  less
dividends paid and additions to property, plant and equipment, was $83.4 million
in 2004, $421.5 million in 2003 and $375.0 million in 2002. The decrease in free
cash flow in 2004 was the result of a cash usage in working capital  components,
primarily  inventory.  The  increase in free cash flow between 2002 and 2003 was
the result of supply chain  initiatives,  including a greater  focus on reducing
inventory  weeks-of-supply.  We expect free cash flow to be  approximately  $200
million to $240 million in 2005.  The increase from 2004 is based  substantially
on the anticipated  increase in cash generated from working  capital,  primarily
from inventory reductions.

We believe free cash flow is an  appropriate  indication  of our ability to fund
share  repurchases,  repay maturing debt, change dividend payments or fund other
uses of capital that management  believes will enhance  shareholder  value.  The
comparable  financial  measure  to  free  cash  flow  under  generally  accepted
accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities, which were $352.5
million in 2004,  $651.9  million in 2003 and $521.6  million in 2002. We do not
intend the presentation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial  measure,  to be
considered in isolation or as a substitute  for measures  prepared in accordance
with GAAP.

The following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating  activities
to free cash flow.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
We consider our financial  structure  and  condition to be sound.  We had $437.9
million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004, as a resource for our
funding needs.  Additionally,  borrowings are available under our $600.0 million
commercial paper program,  which is supported by bank credit  facilities and can
be utilized in the event the commercial paper market becomes  unavailable to us.
However, we currently expect that the commercial paper market would be available
to us,  thus we do not expect to utilize our credit  facilities.  As of December
31, 2004, we had no commercial paper outstanding and had not utilized our credit
facilities.

Debt Obligations

Debt Ratings:  Our debt is considered  investment  grade by the rating agencies.
Below are the agencies' latest ratings by category,  as well as their respective
current outlook for the ratings.

                                                        Standard

                Outlook                       Stable    Stable     Stable

Factors  that can impact our credit  ratings  include  changes in our  operating
performance,  the economic  environment,  conditions  in the retail and consumer
electronics  industries,  our  financial  position  and changes in our  business
strategy.  We do not currently foresee any reasonable  circumstances under which
our credit  ratings would be  significantly  downgraded.  If a downgrade were to
occur,  it could  adversely  impact,  among other things,  our future  borrowing
costs,  access to capital  markets,  vendor financing terms and future new store
occupancy costs.

Our  senior  unsecured  debt  primarily  consists  of two  issuances  of 10-year
long-term notes and an issuance of medium-term notes.

Long-Term  Notes:  We have a $300.0  million debt shelf  registration  statement
which became  effective in August 1997. In August 1997, we issued $150.0 million
of 10-year unsecured long-term notes under this shelf registration. The interest
rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum with  interest  payable on  September 1 and
March 1 of each year. These notes are due September 1, 2007.

On May 11, 2001, we issued  $350.0  million of 10-year 7 3/8% notes in a private
offering  to  initial  purchasers  who in turn  offered  the notes to  qualified
institutional  buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual interest rate on the notes
is 7.375% per annum with  interest  payable  on  November  15 and May 15 of each
year.  The notes mature on May 15, 2011.  In August 2001,  under the terms of an
exchange  offering filed with the SEC, we exchanged  substantially  all of these
notes for a similar amount of publicly  registered notes.  Because no additional
debt was issued in the exchange  offering,  the net effect of this  exchange was
that no  additional  debt was issued,  and  substantially  all of the notes were
registered with the SEC.

During  the  third  quarter  of 2001,  we  entered  into an  interest  rate swap
agreement with  underlying  notional amount of $110.5 million with a maturity in
2007. In June and August 2003,  we entered into  interest  rate swap  agreements
with  underlying  notional  amounts of debt of $100.0 million and $50.0 million,
respectively,  and both with  maturities  in May 2011.  These swaps  effectively
convert a portion  of our  long-term  fixed  rate debt to a  variable  rate.  We
entered into these  agreements  to balance our fixed versus  floating  rate debt
portfolio to continue to take  advantage  of lower  short-term  interest  rates.
Under these agreements,  we have contracted to pay a variable rate of LIBOR plus
a markup and to receive a fixed rate of 6.95% for the swap  entered into in 2001
and  7.375%  for the  swaps  entered  into in  2003.  We have  designated  these
agreements as fair value hedging instruments.
<PAGE>

Medium-Term  Notes: We also issued, in various amounts and on various dates from
December 1997 through September 1999,  medium-term notes totaling $150.0 million
under the shelf registration described above. At December 31, 2004, $5.0 million
of these notes remained outstanding. The interest rate at December 31, 2004, for
the outstanding $5.0 million in medium-term notes was 6.42%.  These notes have a
maturity in 2008. As of December 31, 2004, there was no availability  under this
shelf registration.

Available Financing

Commercial  Paper:  We have  access  to  short-term  debt  instruments,  such as
commercial  paper  issuances,  which are available to supplement  our short-term
financing  needs.  The commercial  paper program,  when utilized,  has a typical
maturity  of 90 days or  less.  The  amount  of  commercial  paper  that  can be
outstanding  is limited to a maximum of the unused  portion of our $600  million
revolving credit facilities described in more detail below. We currently have no
commercial paper outstanding.

Credit  Facilities:  In the second  quarter of 2004,  we replaced  our  existing
$300.0 million 364-day  revolving  credit  facility with a new five-year  credit
facility  maturing in June 2009. The terms of this revolving credit facility are
substantially  similar  to the  previous  facility.  This  credit  facility,  in
addition to our existing $300.0 million five-year credit facility, which expires
in June 2007,  will support our  commercial  paper  borrowings  and is otherwise
available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2004, there were no
outstanding  borrowings under these credit facilities.  Our outstanding debt and
bank  syndicated  credit  facilities  have customary  covenants,  and we were in
compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2004.

Management  believes  that our  present  ability to borrow is  greater  than our
established  credit  lines  and  long-term  debt in  place.  However,  if market
conditions change and sales were to dramatically decline or we could not control
operating costs, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally, if
a scenario as described  above  occurred,  it could cause the rating agencies to
lower our credit  ratings,  thereby  increasing  our  borrowing  costs,  or even
causing a  reduction  in or  elimination  of our  access to debt  and/or  equity
markets.

Dividends

We have paid common stock cash  dividends  for 18 years.  On September 24, 2004,
our Board of Directors  declared an annual  dividend of $0.25 per common  share.
The  dividend  was paid on  December  20,  2004,  to  shareholders  of record on
December 1, 2004. The dividend  payment of $39.7 million was funded from cash on
hand.

Operating Leases

We use operating leases, primarily for our retail locations and two distribution
centers, to lower our capital requirements.

Share Repurchases

We repurchased  6.9 million shares of our common stock for $210.9 million during
the year ended December 31, 2004, under our share repurchase program.

We  intend  to  execute  share  repurchases  from  time to time in order to take
advantage of attractive  share price levels,  as determined by  management.  The
timing  and  terms  of these  transactions  depend  on  market  conditions,  our
liquidity and other  considerations.  In February  2003,  our Board of Directors
authorized a repurchase  program for 15.0 million shares,  which was in addition
to our 25.0  million  share  repurchase  program that was  completed  during the
second  quarter of 2003.  At February  18, 2005,  there were 2.5 million  shares
available to be repurchased  under this 15.0 million share  repurchase  program.
The 15.0 million  share  repurchase  program has no  expiration  date and allows
shares to be repurchased in the open market.  On February 25, 2005, our Board of
Directors  approved a new share  repurchase  program.  This new  program  allows
management to repurchase up to $250 million in open market  purchases and has no
expiration  date. We anticipate  that we will  repurchase,  under our authorized
repurchase  programs,  between  $200.0  million and $250.0 million of our common
stock during 2005. The funding required for these share repurchase programs will
come from cash generated from net sales and operating revenues and cash and cash
equivalents.  We will also  repurchase  shares in the open  market to offset the
sales of shares to our employee benefit plans.

Construction of Corporate Headquarters

In the fourth quarter of 2001 and the second quarter of 2002, we sold our former
corporate headquarters buildings.  We entered into sale-leaseback  agreements in
which our former corporate headquarters' land and buildings were sold and leased
back to us. These arrangements  provided us with the necessary time to construct
our new  headquarters,  which we began  partially  occupying  during  the fourth
quarter of 2004. Our total campus costs are estimated to be $261.5 million, with
completion expected during the first quarter of 2005.

</TABLE>


Our  debt-to-total  capitalization  ratio  decreased  in  2004  from  2003,  due
primarily to an increase in equity of $152.8  million from 2003.  Long-term debt
as a percentage of total  capitalization  decreased in 2004 due to a decrease in
long-term  debt,  as current  maturities of our  outstanding  notes moved to the
short-term  debt  classification,  as well as the  increase  in equity of $152.8
million from 2003.

Treasury Stock

On December 11, 2003,  our Board of Directors  approved the  retirement  of 45.0
million shares of our common stock held as treasury stock. These shares returned
to the status of authorized and unissued. See our 2003 Consolidated Statement of
Stockholders' Equity for additional details of this transaction.

</TABLE>

We have contingent  liabilities related to retail leases of locations which were
assigned  to other  businesses.  The  majority of these  contingent  liabilities
relate to various  lease  obligations  arising from leases that were assigned to
CompUSA,  Inc. as part of the sale of our  Computer  City,  Inc.  subsidiary  to
CompUSA,  Inc. in August 1998. In the event CompUSA or the other  assignees,  as
applicable, are unable to fulfill their obligations, we would be responsible for
rent due under the leases.  Our rent exposure  from the  remaining  undiscounted
lease  commitments  with no  projected  sublease  income is  approximately  $154
million.  However,  we have no  reason  to  believe  that  CompUSA  or the other
assignees will not fulfill their obligations under these leases or that we would
be unable to sublet the properties;  consequently,  we do not believe there will
be a material  impact on our financial  statements from any fulfillment of these
contingencies.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
Other than the operating  leases described above, we do not have any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities.

INFLATION
Inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years. We do not
expect  inflation  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  operations  in the
foreseeable future,  unless international events substantially affect the global
economy.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our consolidated  financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principals ("GAAP") in the United States. The application of
GAAP  requires us to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the reported
values of assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements,  the
reported  amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting  period,  and the
related  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  The use of estimates
is pervasive  throughout our financial  statements and is affected by management
judgment and uncertainties.  Our estimates,  assumptions and judgments are based
on  historical  experience,  current  market  trends and other  factors  that we
believe to be relevant and  reasonable  at the time the  consolidated  financial
statements are prepared.  We continually  evaluate the information  used to make
these  estimates as our business and the economic  environment  changes.  Actual
results may differ  materially from these estimates under different  assumptions
or conditions.

In the Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements,  we describe our significant
accounting  policies  used  in the  preparation  of the  consolidated  financial
statements. The accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are:
revenue  recognition;  inventory valuation under the cost method;  estimation of
reserves and valuation  allowances,  specifically related to insurance,  tax and
legal  contingencies;  and  valuation  of  long-lived  assets  and  intangibles,
including goodwill.

We consider an  accounting  policy or estimate to be critical if it requires our
most  difficult,  subjective  or  complex  judgments,  and  is  material  to the
portrayal of our financial condition,  changes in financial condition or results
of  operations.  The  selection,  application  and  disclosure  of our  critical
accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit and Compliance
Committee of our Board of Directors.
<PAGE>

Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private
label and  third-party  branded  products and services to consumers.  Revenue is
recognized,  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product  returns,  when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,  delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility
is reasonably assured.

Certain products, such as wireless telephones and satellite systems, require the
customer to use the services of a third-party  service provider.  In most cases,
the third-party service provider pays us a fee or commission for obtaining a new
customer,  as well as a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing
arrangement  between the service  provider and the  customer.  Fee or commission
revenue,  net of a reserve for  estimated  service  deactivations,  is generally
recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third-party
service provider.

Estimated  product  refunds and returns,  service plan  deactivations,  residual
revenue and commission revenue  adjustments are based on historical  information
pertaining to these items.  If actual results differ from these estimates due to
various factors,  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected. A
10% difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected
net sales and operating  revenues by  approximately  $1.7 million for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2004.

Inventory  Valuation:   Our  inventory  consists  primarily  of  finished  goods
available for sale at our retail  locations or within our  distribution  centers
and is recorded  at the lower of average  cost or  expected  sales price  (i.e.,
market value).  The cost  components  recorded  within  inventory are the vendor
invoice cost and certain allocated external and internal freight,  distribution,
warehousing  and other costs  required to  transport  the  merchandise  from the
vendor to the point-of-sale, usually a store.

Typically,  the  market  value  of  our  inventory  is  higher  than  its  cost.
Determination of the market value may be very complex and, therefore, requires a
high  degree  of  judgment.  In order  for  management  to make the  appropriate
determination  of market  value,  the following  items are commonly  considered:
inventory  turnover  statistics,  current selling prices,  seasonality  factors,
consumer  trends,  competitive  pricing,  performance  of  similar  products  or
accessories,  planned  promotional  incentives,  and estimated  costs to sell or
dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions.

If the  calculated  market  value is  determined  to be less  than the  recorded
average cost, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory
item.  Differences  between  management  estimates  and actual  performance  and
pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from
the  amount  recorded  at the  financial  statement  date,  and could also cause
fluctuations  in the amount of recorded cost of products  sold.

If our estimates  regarding  market value are  inaccurate or changes in consumer
demand affect  certain  products in an unforeseen  manner,  we may be exposed to
material losses or gains in excess of our established  valuation  reserve.

Estimation  of Reserves  and  Valuation  Allowances:  The amount of liability we
record for claims related to insurance,  tax and legal contingencies requires us
to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred.
We use our past history and experience,  as well as other specific circumstances
surrounding  these claims,  in evaluating the amount of liability that we should
record. As additional  information  becomes  available,  we assess the potential
liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate.
These revisions could materially  impact our results of operations and financial
position or liquidity.

We are insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, property and
other liability claims, with deductibles up to $0.5 million per occurrence. This
insurance  coverage  limits our  exposure for any  catastrophic  claims that may
arise  above  the  deductible.  We  also  have  a  self-insured  health  program
administered  by a third  party  covering  the  majority of our  employees  that
participate  in our health  insurance  programs.  We estimate  the amount of our
reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting
period. This estimate is based on information  provided by either an independent
actuarial  firm or third  party.  The  information  includes  historical  claims
experience,  demographic  factors,  severity factors,  and other factors we deem
relevant.  A 10% change in our  insurance  reserves at December 31, 2004,  would
have affected net income by approximately $7.5 million for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004.  As of December 31, 2004,  actual losses had not exceeded our
expectations.
<PAGE>

We are  subject to  periodic  audits  from  multiple  domestic  and  foreign tax
authorities related to income tax, sales and use tax, personal property tax, and
other forms of taxes.  These audits examine our tax positions,  timing of income
and deductions, and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions. As part
of our evaluation of these tax issues, we establish reserves in our consolidated
financial  statements  based on our estimate of current  probable tax exposures.
Depending  on the  nature of the tax  issue,  it could be  subject to audit over
several  years;  therefore,  our  estimated  reserve  balances  might  exist for
multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority.

Additionally,  we are involved in legal  proceedings and governmental  inquiries
associated  with  employment and other matters.  A reserve has been  established
based on our best estimates of the potential  liability in these  matters.  This
estimate has been developed in  consultation  with in-house and outside  counsel
and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.

Although  we believe  that our tax and legal  reserves  are based on  reasonable
judgments  and  estimates,  actual  results  could differ which may expose us to
material  gains  or  losses  in  future  periods.  These  actual  results  could
materially  affect our effective tax rate,  earnings,  deferred tax balances and
cash in the period of resolution.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles,  Including Goodwill:  Long-lived
assets, such as property and equipment,  are reviewed for impairment when events
or changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the  carrying  value of the assets
contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable.  Our evaluation of
potential  impairment  involves comparing the carrying value of the asset to the
estimated  fair value of the asset.  The fair value is  determined by estimating
the future  undiscounted  cash flows that the asset will  generate.  If the fair
value  calculated is less than the carrying  value,  we calculate the discounted
cash flows of the asset and record an impairment  loss. The  impairment  loss is
the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset and is
recorded  as a charge to  earnings  in the period  the  impairment  occurs.  The
carrying  value of the asset is  adjusted  to the new  carrying  value,  and any
subsequent  increases  in fair value are not  recorded.  Additionally,  if it is
determined  that the  estimated  remaining  useful  life of the asset  should be
decreased,  the  periodic  depreciation  expense  is  adjusted  based on the new
carrying value of the asset.

The  impairment   calculation  requires  us  to  apply  judgment  and  estimates
concerning  the future cash flows,  strategic  plans,  useful life and  discount
rates. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and  assumptions,
we may be exposed to  additional  impairment  charges which could be material to
our results of operations.

We have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable  intangibles related
to business  acquisitions that have occurred during the current and prior years.
The  original  valuation  of  these  intangibles  is  typically  performed  by a
third-party  appraiser  and may  include  the use of  estimates  that we provide
concerning future  profitability,  cash flows and other judgmental  factors.  We
review our goodwill and intangible  balances on an annual basis,  typically near
our fiscal year end, and whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate
the carrying  value of the goodwill or  intangibles  might exceed their  current
fair value.

The determination of fair value is based on various valuation techniques such as
discounted  cash flow and other  comparable  market  analyses.  These  valuation
techniques  require  us to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  regarding  future
profitability,  industry factors, planned strategic initiatives,  discount rates
and others factors.  If actual results or performance of certain  business units
are different  from our  estimates,  we may be exposed to an  impairment  charge
related to our  goodwill or  intangibles.  The total value of our  goodwill  and
intangibles at December 31, 2004, was $46.7 million.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

Matters   discussed  in  MD&A  and  in  other  parts  of  this  report   include
forward-looking  statements  within the meaning of the federal  securities laws.
These matters include  statements  concerning  management's plans and objectives
relating to our operations or economic performance and related  assumptions.  We
specifically  disclaim  any duty to update any of the  information  set forth in
this  report,   including  any   forward-looking   statements.   Forward-looking
statements  are made based on  management's  current  expectations  and  beliefs
concerning  future  events  and,  therefore,  involve  a  number  of  risks  and
uncertainties.  Management  cautions  that  forward-looking  statements  are not
guarantees,  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed
or implied in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause
our actual  results of  operations or financial  condition to differ  materially
include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following factors.

General Business Factors

o    Changes in national or regional U.S. economic  conditions,  including,  but
     not limited to, recessionary or inflationary trends,  equity market levels,
     consumer credit availability,  interest rates, consumers' disposable income
     and  spending  levels,  continued  rise of oil  prices,  job  security  and
     unemployment, and overall consumer confidence;
o    changes  in the  amount  and  degree of  promotional  intensity  exerted by
     current  competitors and potential new competition  from both retail stores
     and alternative  methods or channels of  distribution,  such as e-commerce,
     telephone shopping services and mail order;
o    any potential  tariffs  imposed on products  that we import from China,  as
     well as the potential  strengthening  of China's  currency against the U.S.
     dollar;
o    continuing  terrorist  activities in the U.S., as well as the international
     war on terrorism;
o    the  disruption  of  international,  national  or  regional  transportation
     systems;
o    the lack of availability or access to sources of inventory;
o    changes in the financial  markets that would reduce or eliminate our access
     to longer term capital or short-term credit availability;
o    the imposition of new  restrictions  or regulations  regarding the products
     and/or services we sell or changes in tax rules and regulations  applicable
     to us; and
o    the occurrence of severe weather  events or natural  disasters  which could
     significantly   damage  or  destroy  outlets  or  prohibit  consumers  from
     traveling  to our retail  locations,  especially  during  the peak  holiday
     shopping season.

RadioShack Specific Factors

o    The inability to  successfully  execute our solutions  strategy to dominate
     cost-effective  solutions to meet everyone's routine  electronics needs and
     families' distinct electronics wants;
o    the failure to differentiate ourselves as an electronics specialty retailer
     in the U.S. marketplace;
o    the failure to maintain or increase the level of sales in our  non-wireless
     business categories;
o    any  reductions or changes in the growth rate of the wireless  industry and
     changes in the wireless  communications  industry  dynamics,  including the
     effects of industry consolidation;
o    the inability to create,  maintain or renew profitable contracts or execute
     business  plans with  providers of  third-party  branded  products and with
     service providers relating to cellular and PCS telephones which could cause
     the reduction or elimination of our commissions as well as residual income;
o    the presence or absence of new services or products and product features in
     the  merchandise  categories we sell and  unexpected  changes in our actual
     merchandise sales mix;
o    the  inability  to  effectively  manage our  inventory  levels in a rapidly
     changing marketplace;
o    the inability to attract, retain and grow an effective management team in a
     dynamic  environment or changes in the cost or  availability  of a suitable
     workforce to manage and support our operating strategies;
o    the  inability to optimize and execute our strategic  plans,  including our
     retail services operations and other sales channels;
o    the existence of contingent lease  obligations  related to our discontinued
     retail operations  arising from an assignee's or a sub-lessee's  failure to
     fulfill its lease  commitments,  or from our inability to identify suitable
     sub-lessees for vacant facilities;
o    the  inability  to  successfully   identify  and  analyze  emerging  growth
     opportunities in the areas of strategic business  alliances,  acquisitions,
     licensing  opportunities,   new  markets,  non-store  sales  channels,  and
     innovative products; and
o    the inability to successfully  identify and enter into  relationships  with
     developers of new  technologies or the failure of these new technologies to
     be adopted by the market.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

At December 31, 2004, we did not have any derivative instruments that materially
increased  our  exposure to market risks for interest  rates,  foreign  currency
rates,  commodity  prices or other market  price risks,  other than the interest
rate  swaps  noted  in our  MD&A  discussion.  We do  not  use  derivatives  for
speculative purposes.

Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in  short-term  interest
rates.  Interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment at December
31, 2004, of $86.2 million,  comprised of fluctuating  short-term investments of
$386.2 million and offset by $300.0 million of  indebtedness  which,  because of
our interest  rate swaps,  effectively  bears  interest at  short-term  floating
rates.  A  hypothetical  increase  of 100  basis  points  in the  interest  rate
applicable  to this  floating-rate  net  exposure  would result in a decrease in
annual net interest expense of $0.9 million.  This assumption  assumes no change
in the net principal balance.

We also  manage  our  portfolio  of fixed rate debt to reduce  our  exposure  to
interest  rate  changes.  The fair  value of our fixed  rate  long-term  debt is
sensitive to long-term interest rate changes. Interest rate changes would result
in  increases  or  decreases  in the fair  value of our debt due to  differences
between market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt obligation.
Based on a hypothetical  immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates at
December  31,  2004 and 2003,  the fair value of our fixed rate  long-term  debt
would  decrease  $24.2  million  and  $28.7  million,  respectively.  Based on a
hypothetical  immediate 100 basis point  decrease in interest  rates at December
31,  2004 and  2003,  the fair  value of our fixed  rate  long-term  debt  would
increase by $25.7 million and $30.6  million,  respectively.  Regarding the fair
value of our fixed rate debt,  changes in  interest  rates have no impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have  established a system of  disclosure  controls and  procedures  that are
designed to ensure that material information  relating to the Company,  which is
required to be timely  disclosed,  is accumulated and communicated to management
in a timely  fashion.  An  evaluation  of the  effectiveness  of the  design and
operation  of our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  (as  defined  in  Rule
13a-15(e)  under the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934  ("Exchange  Act"))  was
performed  as of the end of the  period  covered  by this  annual  report.  This
evaluation was performed  under the supervision  and with the  participation  of
management,  including our Chief  Executive  Officer and Acting Chief  Financial
Officer.

Based upon that  evaluation,  our CEO and Acting CFO have  concluded  that these
disclosure  controls and  procedures  were effective as of the end of the period
covered  by this  annual  report  to  ensure  that  information  required  to be
disclosed  by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded,  processed,  summarized and reported within the time periods specified
by the SEC's rules and forms.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control  over  financial  reporting,  as such term is  defined in  Exchange  Act
Rule~13a-15(f).  Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our
management,  including our CEO and Acting CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness  of our internal  control over  financial  reporting  based on the
framework in "Internal Control -  Integrated  Framework" issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on our evaluation
under the framework in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework," our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2004.  Our  management's  assessment  of the  effectiveness  of our
internal  control over  financial  reporting  as of December 31, 2004,  has been
audited  by   PricewaterhouseCoopers   LLP,  an  independent  registered  public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
<PAGE>

Changes in Internal Controls

There were no changes in our internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that
occurred  during our last fiscal quarter that have materially  affected,  or are
reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  our internal  control over  financial
reporting.

ITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMATION.

             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of RadioShack Corporation:

We  have  completed  an  integrated  audit  of  RadioShack   Corporation's  2004
consolidated  financial  statements  and of its internal  control over financial
reporting as of December  31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002  consolidated
financial  statements  in accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Our opinions,  based on our audits,
are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of
RadioShack Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2004
and 2003,  and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of
the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  2004 in  conformity  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these  statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States).
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit of financial  statements includes  examining,  on a test
basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion,  management's assessment,  included in Management's Report
on Internal Control Over Financial  Reporting  appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company  maintained  effective  internal control over financial  reporting as of
December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway
Commission  (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material  respects,  based on those
criteria.  Furthermore,  in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria  established in Internal Control - Integrated  Framework
issued by the COSO.  The Company's  management is  responsible  for  maintaining
effective  internal  control over financial  reporting and for its assessment of
the   effectiveness   of  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.   Our
responsibility  is to express  opinions on  management's  assessment  and on the
effectiveness of the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting based
on our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit of  internal  control  over  financial
reporting in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting
Oversight  Board  (United  States).  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform  the  audit to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material
respects.  An  audit of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes
obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,
evaluating  management's  assessment,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design and
operating   effectiveness  of  internal  control,   and  performing  such  other
procedures as we consider  necessary in the  circumstances.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.



<PAGE>

A company's  internal control over financial  reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting
and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the  assets  of  the  company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company;  and (iii) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or
timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
RadioShack Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
RadioShack Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1967. We primarily engage
in the  retail  sale of  consumer  electronic  goods and  services  through  our
RadioShack store chain. Our strategy is to dominate cost-effective  solutions to
meet everyone's  routine  electronics needs and families'  distinct  electronics
wants.  Throughout  this report,  the terms  "our," "we," "us" and  "RadioShack"
refer to RadioShack Corporation, including its subsidiaries.

Company-Operated  Stores: At December 31, 2004, we operated 5,046 company stores
located  throughout  the United  States,  as well as in Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin  Islands.  These stores are located in major malls and strip centers,  as
well as individual storefronts. Each location carries a broad assortment of both
private label and third-party branded consumer electronics products. Our product
lines include  wireless  phones and  communication  devices such as scanners and
two-way   radios;   residential   telephones,   DVD   players,   computers   and
direct-to-home ("DTH") satellite systems; home entertainment,  wireless, imaging
and computer accessories; general and special purpose batteries; wire, cable and
connectivity  products;  and digital  cameras,  radio-controlled  cars and other
toys,  satellite radios,  memory players and wellness products.  We also provide
consumers access to third-party  services such as cellular and PCS phone and DTH
satellite  activation,  satellite radio service,  prepaid  wireless  airtime and
extended service plans.

Dealer  Outlets:  At December  31,  2004,  we also had a network of 1,788 dealer
outlets,  including 45 located outside of the U.S. These outlets provide private
label and third-party branded products and services to smaller communities.  The
dealers are  generally  engaged in other  retail  operations  and augment  their
businesses with our products and service offerings. Our sales derived outside of
the United States are not material.

Company-Operated  Kiosks:  At December 31, 2004, we operated 599 kiosks  located
throughout  the United  States.  These  kiosks are  primarily  inside SAM'S CLUB
locations,  as  well  as  in  major  malls.  These  locations,   which  are  not
RadioShack-branded,  offer product lines including  wireless  telephones and the
associated accessories. We also provide consumers access to third-party cellular
and PCS phone services.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation:  The Consolidated  Financial Statements include our
accounts and our  majority-owned  subsidiaries.  Investments in 20% to 50% owned
companies are accounted for using the equity  method.  Significant  intercompany
transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications:  Certain amounts in the December 31, 2003 and 2002, financial
statements  have been  reclassified  to  conform  with the  December  31,  2004,
presentation.   These   reclassifications   had  no  effect  on  net  income  or
stockholders' equity as previously reported.

Pervasiveness  of  Estimates:   The  preparation  of  financial   statements  in
conformity with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires us to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities,  related revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of gain and loss
contingencies  at the date of the  financial  statements  and during the periods
presented.   Our  most  significant   estimates  and  assumptions   include  the
determination of estimates for third-party  service  deactivations in connection
with revenue recognition and receivables, inventory valuation, depreciable lives
of property,  plant and equipment,  insurance  reserves,  intangible assets, and
contingency and litigation reserves. Actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.

Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private
label and  third-party  branded  products and services to consumers.  Revenue is
recognized,  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product  returns,  when
delivery has occurred or services have been  rendered,  the sales price is fixed
or determinable,  and  collectibility is reasonably  assured.  Certain products,
such as wireless  telephones and satellite systems,  require the customer to use
the services of a third-party  service provider.  In most cases, the third-party
service  provider pays us a fee or commission  for obtaining a new customer,  as
well as a monthly recurring  residual amount based upon the ongoing  arrangement
between the service provider and the customer. Fee or commission revenue, net of
estimated  service  deactivations,  is  generally  recognized  at the  time  the
customer  is  accepted  as a  subscriber  of  a  third-party  service  provider.
Recurring  residual  income  is  recognized  as  earned  under the terms of each
contract with the service  provider,  which is typically as the service provider
bills its customer, generally on a monthly basis.
<PAGE>

We offer  extended  service  contracts  in all states in which we  operate,  but
retain the  liability for these  contracts in only three  states.  For all other
states,  our share of commission revenue is recognized as income at the time the
contract is sold. For the contracts offered in the three states where we are the
primary  obligor,  revenues  from  the sale of these  contracts  are  recognized
ratably over the terms of the contracts.  Costs directly  related to the sale of
such contracts are deferred and charged to cost of products sold proportionately
as the  revenues  are  recognized.  A loss is  recognized  on  extended  service
contracts if the sum of the expected costs of providing services pursuant to the
contracts exceeds the related unearned revenue.

Cost of  Products  Sold:  Cost of  products  sold  includes  the  total  cost of
merchandise  inventory sold; costs of services  provided;  external and internal
freight expenses;  distribution costs;  warehousing costs; customer shipping and
handling charges;  certain vendor allowances that are not specific,  incremental
and identifiable; and physical inventory valuation adjustments and losses.

Vendor Allowances:  We receive allowances from third-party service providers and
product vendors through a variety of promotional  programs and arrangements as a
result of  purchasing  and promoting  their  products and services in the normal
course of business.  We consider vendor allowances received to be a reduction in
the price of a vendor's  products or services  and record them as a component of
cost of products  sold when the related  product or service is sold,  unless the
allowances  represent  reimbursement  of specific,  incremental and identifiable
costs  incurred to promote a vendor's  products and  services,  in which case we
record  them when  earned as an offset to the  associated  expense  incurred  to
promote the applicable products and/or services.

Advertising  Costs:  Our  advertising  costs are  expensed  the  first  time the
advertising takes place. We receive allowances from certain  third-party service
providers  and  product  vendors  which we  record  when  earned as an offset to
advertising  expense incurred to promote the applicable products and/or services
only if the allowances  represent  reimbursement  of specific,  incremental  and
identifiable   costs  (see  our  previous   "Vendor   Allowances"   discussion).
Advertising  expense was $271.5  million,  $254.4 million and $241.0 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively,  net of vendor
allowances of $33.9 million, $40.9 million and $59.6 million, respectively.

Stock-Based  Compensation:  At December  31,  2004,  we had various  stock-based
employee  compensation plans in use. We measure  stock-based  compensation costs
under Accounting  Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued  to  Employees,"  and  its  related  interpretations.   Accordingly,   no
compensation expense has been recognized for our fixed price stock option plans,
as the  exercise  price of options  must be equal to or  greater  than the stock
price on the date of grant  under our  incentive  stock  plans.  The table below
illustrates  the effect on net income and net income  available per common share
as if we had  accounted  for our  employee  stock  options  under the fair value
recognition  provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation."  For purposes of the pro
forma disclosures below, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to
expense over the vesting period.  We will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
"Share-Based  Payment,"  which was issued in December  2004,  effective  July 1,
2005,  and will modify our  accounting for stock options and other equity awards
accordingly. See "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements" below.

Earnings  per Share:  Basic  earnings  per share is  computed  based only on the
weighted average number of common shares  outstanding for each period presented.
Diluted  earnings per share  reflects  the  potential  dilution  that would have
occurred if securities or other  contracts to issue common stock were exercised,
converted,  or  resulted in the  issuance  of common  stock that would have then
shared in the  earnings  of the  entity.  The  following  table  reconciles  the
numerator  and  denominator  used in the basic and  diluted  earnings  per share
calculations.

Options to purchase 10.9 million, 16.8 million and 18.1 million shares of common
stock in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were not included in the computation
of diluted  earnings  per common  share  because the option  exercise  price was
greater  than the average  market  price of the common stock during the year and
the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
<PAGE>

Cash and Cash  Equivalents:  Cash on hand in stores,  deposits  in banks and all
highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months
or less at the time of purchase are  considered  cash and cash  equivalents.  We
carry our cash equivalents at cost, which approximates fair value because of the
short maturity of the instruments. The weighted average interest rates were 2.2%
and 1.0% at  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively,  for cash  equivalents
totaling $386.2 million and $566.4 million, respectively.

Accounts  Receivable  and Allowance  for Doubtful  Accounts:  Concentrations  of
credit risk with respect to customer and dealer  receivables  are limited due to
the large  number of  customers,  dealers and their  location in many  different
geographic  areas of the  country.  However,  we do have some  concentration  of
credit risk from service providers in the wireless  telephone  industry,  due to
sales of their  products and  services.  We establish an allowance  for doubtful
accounts  based on factors  surrounding  the credit risk of specific  customers,
historical trends and other information and,  historically,  such losses, in the
aggregate,  have not exceeded  our  expectations.  Account  balances are charged
against the allowance  when we believe it is probable that the  receivable  will
not be recovered.

Inventories:  Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally based
on average cost) or market value and are comprised primarily of finished goods.

Property,  Plant and  Equipment:  We state our property,  plant and equipment at
cost, less accumulated  depreciation and amortization.  For financial  reporting
purposes,  depreciation  and  amortization  are primarily  calculated  using the
straight-line  method,  which  amortizes  the  cost  of the  assets  over  their
estimated useful lives. When we sell or retire depreciable assets, we remove the
related  cost and  accumulated  depreciation  from our accounts and we recognize
gains and losses.  Major additions and betterments are capitalized.  Maintenance
and  repairs  which  do not  materially  improve  or  extend  the  lives  of the
respective assets are charged to operations as we incur these expenses.

Capitalized Software Costs: We capitalize qualifying costs related to developing
internal-use  software.  Capitalization  of costs  begins  after the  conceptual
formulation  stage has been completed.  Capitalized costs are amortized over the
estimated  useful life of the  software,  which  ranges  between  three and five
years.  Capitalized  software costs at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, totaled
$42.6 million, $37.9 million and $43.8 million, net of accumulated  amortization
of $65.8 million, $53.3 million and $39.0 million, respectively.

Impairment  of  Long-Lived   Assets:  We  review  long-lived  assets  (primarily
property, plant and equipment,  goodwill and intangibles) held and used by us or
to be disposed of for  impairment  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances
indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be  recoverable.  Pursuant
to the  provisions  of SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill  and Other  Intangible  Assets,"
goodwill and intangible  assets are not amortized,  but are reviewed annually at
the end of our fiscal  year for  impairment  (and in interim  periods if certain
events  occur  indicating  that the carrying  value of goodwill  and  intangible
assets may be impaired).

Goodwill and Intangibles:  Goodwill  represents the excess of the purchase price
over the fair  value of net assets  acquired.  At  December  31,  2004,  our net
goodwill  balance  totaled  $26.8  million,   comprised  primarily  of  goodwill
resulting  from the  acquisition  of the SAM'S  CLUB  kiosk  business  effective
October 1, 2004. Additionally, we had $25.2 million in intangible assets arising
from the SAM'S CLUB kiosk business acquisition.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  The fair value of financial instruments is
determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques as
appropriate.   Unless  otherwise   disclosed,   the  fair  values  of  financial
instruments  approximate their recorded values,  due primarily to the short-term
nature of their maturities or their varying interest rates.

Income  Taxes:  Income  taxes are  accounted  for using the asset and  liability
method.  Deferred taxes are recognized  for the tax  consequences  of "temporary
differences" by applying enacted  statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to  differences  between the financial  statement  carrying  amounts and the tax
bases of existing  assets and  liabilities.  The effect on  deferred  taxes of a
change in tax rates is  recognized  in income in the period  that  includes  the
enactment date. In addition, we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that
such benefits are more likely than not to be realized.
<PAGE>

Derivatives:  We use our interest rate swap agreements to effectively  convert a
portion  of our  long-term  fixed  rate debt to a  variable  rate.  Under  these
agreements,  we pay a variable  rate of LIBOR plus a markup  and  receive  fixed
rates ranging from 6.950% to 7.375%. We have designated these agreements as fair
value hedging  instruments.  The  accounting for changes in the fair value of an
interest  rate  swap  depends  on the  use of the  swap.  To the  extent  that a
derivative  is  effective  as a hedge of an exposure  to future  changes in fair
value, the change in the derivative's fair value is recorded in earnings,  as is
the change in fair value of the item being hedged.  To the extent that a swap is
effective  as a cash flow hedge of an exposure to future  changes in cash flows,
the  change  in  fair  value  of the  swap  is  deferred  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive  income.  Any portion we consider to be ineffective is immediately
reported  in our  earnings.  The  differentials  to be  received  or paid  under
interest rate swap contracts  designated as hedges are recognized in income over
the life of the contracts as adjustments to interest  expense.  Gains and losses
on terminations of interest rate contracts designated as hedges are deferred and
amortized  into  interest  expense  over  the  remaining  life  of the  original
contracts  or until  repayment  of the hedged  indebtedness.  Through the use of
interest rate swap agreements,  we have reduced our net interest expense by $8.7
million,  $7.8 million and $5.1  million for the years ended  December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

We maintain strict internal controls over our hedging activities,  which include
policies and  procedures  for risk  assessment  and the approval,  reporting and
monitoring of all derivative  financial  instrument  activities.  We monitor our
hedging  positions  and  credit  worthiness  of our  counter-parties  and do not
anticipate losses due to our counter-parties' nonperformance.  We do not hold or
issue derivative financial  instruments for trading or speculative  purposes. To
qualify for hedge  accounting,  derivatives  must meet defined  correlation  and
effectiveness  criteria,  be  designated as a hedge and result in cash flows and
financial  statement  effects  that  substantially  offset those of the position
being hedged.

Foreign  Currency  Translation:  The functional  currency of  substantially  all
operations outside the U.S. is the applicable local currency.  Translation gains
or losses related to net assets  located  outside the United States are included
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and are classified in the
stockholders' equity section of the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Comprehensive  Income:  Comprehensive  income is defined as the change in equity
(net assets) of a business enterprise during a period,  except for those changes
resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.  Comprehensive
income is comprised  of the gain (loss) on an interest  rate swap used as a cash
flow hedge and foreign currency translation adjustments,  which are shown net of
tax in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.

Recently  Issued  Accounting  Pronouncements:  In December  2003,  the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued revised FIN 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest  Entities,  an Interpretation of Accounting  Research Bulletin
No. 51" ("FIN 46R"). FIN 46R requires the consolidation of an entity in which an
enterprise  absorbs a  majority  of the  entity's  expected  losses,  receives a
majority of the entity's  expected  residual  returns,  or both,  as a result of
ownership,  contractual  or other  financial  interests in the entity  (variable
interest entities or "VIEs").  FIN 46R is applicable for financial statements of
public  entities  that have  interests in VIEs or potential  VIEs referred to as
special-purpose   entities  for  periods   ending   after   December  31,  2003.
Applications  by public entities for all other types of entities are required in
financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The application of
FIN 46R did not have a material  impact on our results of operations,  financial
position or liquidity, and does not apply to our dealer outlets.

In  December  2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  123R.  SFAS No. 123R  establishes
standards for the accounting for  transactions in which an entity  exchanges its
equity  instruments for goods or services.  This Statement  focuses primarily on
accounting  for  transactions  in which an entity obtains  employee  services in
share-based payment transactions.  SFAS No. 123R requires that the fair value of
such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical  financial
statements as services are performed.  Prior to SFAS No. 123R,  only certain pro
forma  disclosures of fair value were required.  We will adopt the provisions of
SFAS No. 123R beginning with the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, which begins
on July 1, 2005. We intend to elect the modified  prospective  transition method
which  will  require  that we  recognize  compensation  expense  for all new and
unvested  share-based  payment  awards  from the  effective  date.  Based on our
preliminary  analysis of SFAS No. 123R, we anticipate that the after-tax  impact
of adoption on our results of operations for the six months ending  December 31,
2005, will be an expense of approximately $6.8 million.
<PAGE>

During fiscal year 2004, we adopted  Emerging  Issues Task Force  ("EITF") Issue
No.  03-10,  "Application  of Issue No. 02-16 by  Resellers to Sales  Incentives
Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,"  which amends EITF No. 02-16.  According
to the amended guidance, if certain criteria are met,  consideration received by
a reseller in the form of reimbursement  from a vendor for honoring the vendor's
sales incentives  offered directly to consumers (i.e.,  manufacturers'  coupons)
should not be recorded as a reduction  of the cost of the  reseller's  purchases
from the vendor.  The adoption of EITF No. 03-10 did not  materially  impact our
results of operations, financial position or liquidity in fiscal year 2004.

In November  2004,  the FASB issued  SFAS No.  151,  "Inventory  Costs." The new
Statement  amends  Accounting  Research  Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,  "Inventory
Pricing,"  to clarify  the  accounting  for  abnormal  amounts of idle  facility
expense,  freight,  handling costs, and wasted material.  SFAS 151 requires that
these items be recognized as current-period charges and requires that allocation
of fixed  production  overhead to the cost of  conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the  production  facilities.  This statement is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect adoption of this statement
to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

from our third-party  service  providers and product vendors,  after taking into
account   estimates   for  service   providers'   customer   deactivations   and

During  2004,  we  substantially  completed  construction  of our new  corporate
campus. These expenditures,  including  capitalized interest of $6.6 million and
$2.6  million  for the years  2004 and  2003,  respectively,  are the  principal
reasons for the increases in buildings and furniture, fixtures and equipment.

From time to time, we enter into store operating  lease  agreements that provide
for landlord-funded construction allowances for the purchase and installation of
leasehold   improvements.   Prior  to  January  2004,  we  accounted  for  these
construction  allowances  as a reduction  of  leasehold  improvements;  however,
beginning January 1, 2004 all construction  allowances received were recorded as
deferred rent and are ratably  amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the
lease term. We believe our prior accounting for  construction  allowances had no
material impact on our consolidated  financial statements for 2003 and 2002, and
therefore no accounting adjustments are necessary or have been made.

During the third  quarter of fiscal year 2004,  we acquired  certain  assets and
assumed  certain  liabilities of Wireless  Retail,  Inc.  ("WRI").  These assets
included  wireless  kiosks  and  inventory  located  within  SAM'S  CLUB  retail
locations.   This  acquisition   enables  us  to  leverage  our  retail  support
infrastructure   to  expand  into  other  retail  channels  more  rapidly.   The
acquisition  was  accounted  for using the  purchase  method  of  accounting  as
prescribed  in SFAS No.  141,  "Business  Combinations"  ("SFAS  No.  141").  In
accordance  with SFAS No. 141,  the purchase  price was  allocated to the assets
acquired and  liabilities  assumed based on estimates of their  respective  fair
values at the date of acquisition.  Fair values were  determined  principally by
independent  valuations  and supported by internal  studies.  The total purchase
price of $59.1 million was allocated  primarily to fixed assets,  goodwill and a
separately identifiable intangible asset, which is our contract with SAM'S CLUB.
The preliminary  purchase price  allocation to goodwill was $23.1 million and to
intangibles  was $25.2  million.  Although  the  purchase  price  allocation  is
preliminary,   we  do  not  anticipate  any   significant   adjustments  at  the
finalization of this process.  If necessary,  however, we may record adjustments
to these intangible balances in subsequent periods.

This SAM'S CLUB  intangible is being amortized over five years and the estimated
amortization  for years ended December 31, 2005,  2006,  2007, 2008, and 2009 is
$5.3 million,  $5.3  million,  $5.3  million,  $5.3  million,  and $4.0 million,
respectively.

NOTE 6 - IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
AmeriLink  was  acquired  in 1999 to  provide us with  residential  installation
capabilities  for the  technologies  and services  offered in our retail stores.
From  the time of its  acquisition,  AmeriLink  incurred  operating  losses  and
negative  cash flows.  In 2000 and in 2001,  we  attempted  to  restructure  and
reorganize  AmeriLink,  but due to the  overall  slowdown in the economy and the
market decline for professionally installed home Internet connectivity services,
AmeriLink  continued to report  losses.  During the fourth  quarter of 2001,  we
prepared a revised analysis of estimated future cash flows for AmeriLink,  which
indicated  that its  long-lived  assets were  impaired.  The  carrying  value of
AmeriLink's  long-lived assets (principally  goodwill and fixed assets) exceeded
the discounted present value of the estimated future cash flows by approximately
$37.0 million.  An impairment of goodwill for that amount was recorded for 2001.
As a result of continued  difficulties  in the DTH business and a refocus during
the fourth quarter of 2002 on our satellite installation strategy, together with
a  revised  cash flow  projection  for our  overall  installation  business,  we
determined that the remaining  long-lived  assets associated with AmeriLink were
impaired.  We compared the carrying value of these long-lived  assets with their
fair value and determined  that the remaining  goodwill  balance of $8.1 million
was impaired and we, therefore, recorded an impairment charge for this amount in
the accompanying 2002 Consolidated Statement of Income. As of December 31, 2002,
there was no remaining  goodwill on our balance sheet  related to AmeriLink.  In
September 2003, we sold AmeriLink, resulting in a loss of $1.8 million which was
recorded in other income in our Consolidated Statement of Income for 2003.

There were no significant impairments for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The fair value of our  long-term  debt of $544.0  million and $583.2  million at
December  31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively,  (including  current  portion,  but
excluding capital leases) was  approximately  $629.7 million and $656.7 million,
respectively.  The fair values were computed  using interest rates which were in
effect at the balance sheet dates for similar debt instruments.

Our  senior  unsecured  debt  primarily  consists  of two  issuances  of 10-year
long-term notes and an issuance of medium-term notes.

Long-Term  Notes:  We have a $300.0  million debt shelf  registration  statement
which became  effective in August 1997. In August 1997, we issued $150.0 million
of 10-year unsecured long-term notes under this shelf registration. The interest
rate on the notes is 6.95% per annum with  interest  payable on  September 1 and
March 1 of each year. These notes are due September 1, 2007.

On May 11, 2001, we issued  $350.0  million of 10-year 7 3/8% notes in a private
offering  to  initial  purchasers  who in turn  offered  the notes to  qualified
institutional  buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual interest rate on the notes
is 7.375% per annum with  interest  payable  on  November  15 and May 15 of each
year.  The notes mature on May 15, 2011.  In August 2001,  under the terms of an
exchange  offering filed with the SEC, we exchanged  substantially  all of these
notes for a similar amount of publicly  registered notes.  Because no additional
debt was issued in the exchange  offering,  the net effect of this  exchange was
that no  additional  debt was issued,  and  substantially  all of the notes were
registered with the SEC.
<PAGE>

During  the  third  quarter  of 2001,  we  entered  into an  interest  rate swap
agreement with  underlying  notional amount of $110.5 million with a maturity in
2007. In June and August 2003,  we entered into  interest  rate swap  agreements
with  underlying  notional  amounts of debt of $100.0 million and $50.0 million,
respectively,  and both with  maturities  in May 2011.  These swaps  effectively
convert a portion  of our  long-term  fixed  rate debt to a  variable  rate.  We
entered into these  agreements  to balance our fixed versus  floating  rate debt
portfolio to continue to take  advantage  of lower  short-term  interest  rates.
Under these agreements,  we have contracted to pay a variable rate of LIBOR plus
a markup and to receive a fixed rate of 6.95% for the swap  entered into in 2001
and  7.375%  for the  swaps  entered  into in  2003.  We have  designated  these
agreements  as fair value  hedging  instruments.  We recorded an amount in other
assets, net, of $5.4 million and $4.5 million (their fair value) at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, for the swap agreements and adjusted the fair value
of the related  debt by the same amount.  Fair value was  computed  based on the
market's  current  anticipation  of quarterly LIBOR rate levels from the present
until the swaps' maturity.

Medium-Term  Notes: We also issued, in various amounts and on various dates from
December 1997 through September 1999,  medium-term notes totaling $150.0 million
under the shelf registration described above. At December 31, 2004, $5.0 million
of these notes remained outstanding. The interest rate at December 31, 2004, for
the outstanding $5.0 million in medium-term notes was 6.42%.  These notes have a
maturity in 2008. As of December 31, 2004, there was no availability  under this
shelf registration.

Our  short-term  credit  facilities,   including  revolving  credit  lines,  are
summarized in the accompanying  short-term borrowing facilities table above. The
method used to compute averages in the short-term  borrowing facilities table is
based on a daily weighted average  computation that takes into consideration the
time period such debt was outstanding,  as well as the amount  outstanding.  Our
financing,  primarily  short-term debt, if utilized,  would consist primarily of
commercial paper, which is described in more detail below.

Commercial  Paper:  We have  access  to  short-term  debt  instruments,  such as
commercial  paper  issuances,  available to supplement our short-term  financing
needs. The commercial paper program, when utilized, has a typical maturity of 90
days or less. The amount of commercial  paper that can be outstanding is limited
to a  maximum  of the  unused  portion  of our  $600  million  revolving  credit
facilities described in more detail below. We currently have no commercial paper
outstanding.
<PAGE>

Credit  Facilities:  In the second  quarter of 2004,  we replaced  our  existing
$300.0 million 364-day  revolving  credit  facility with a new five-year  credit
facility  maturing in June 2009. The terms of this revolving credit facility are
substantially  similar  to the  previous  facility.  This  credit  facility,  in
addition to our existing $300.0 million  five-year credit facility which expires
in June 2007,  will support our  commercial  paper  borrowings  and is otherwise
available for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2004, there were no
outstanding  borrowings under these credit facilities.  Our outstanding debt and
bank  syndicated  credit  facilities  have customary  covenants,  and we were in
compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2004.

Other  Indebtedness:  We established an employee stock  ownership  trust in June
1990. Further  information on the trust and its related  indebtedness,  which we
guaranteed,  is detailed in the discussion of the RadioShack 401(k) Plan in Note
19.

In the second quarter of 2002, we sold and leased back our corporate  technology
center building,  recording this transaction as a financing obligation,  because
we retained  certain  responsibilities  during the lease term. Under a financing
obligation,  the associated  assets remain on our balance sheet. This obligation
has a three-year  term  expiring in 2005 with renewal  options.  The lessors are
unrelated  third-parties.  We entered into this  transaction in contemplation of
and  to  facilitate  the  relocation  of  our  corporate  headquarters  to a new
custom-built  corporate campus, which was substantially complete at December 31,
2004.  We began to occupy the new campus in the fourth  quarter of 2004 and will
be completed in the first quarter of 2005.

NOTE 8 - TREASURY STOCK RETIREMENT
In December 2003, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of 45.0 million
shares of our common stock held as treasury stock.  These shares returned to the
status of authorized and unissued.  Additional details of the transaction may be
seen in our 2003 Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity.

Deferred  revenue at December 31, 2004 was the result of us receiving funds from
wireless  vendors in  conjunction  with the  acquisition of the SAM'S CLUB kiosk
business.

NOTE 11 - BUSINESS RESTRUCTURINGS
At December 31, 2004, the balance in the  restructuring  reserve  related to the
closure  in 1996 and  1997 of  various  McDuff,  Computer  City  and  Incredible
Universe  retail stores was $5.1 million.  This reserve  represents the expected
costs to be paid in connection with the remaining real estate lease obligations.
If these facilities'  sublease income declines in their respective markets or if
it takes longer than  expected to sublease or dispose of these  facilities,  the
actual  losses  could exceed this reserve  estimate.  Costs will  continue to be
incurred over the remaining terms of the related  leases.  During the year ended
December 31, 2004,  costs of $11.9  million were charged  against this  reserve,
principally relating to the settlement of one location in Miami, Florida.

NOTE 12 - GAIN ON CONTRACT TERMINATION
RadioShack and Microsoft  Corporation  mutually  agreed during 2002 to terminate
their  agreement and settle the remaining  commitments  each had to one another.
The termination of this agreement took effect at the start of the fourth quarter
of 2002, upon satisfaction of several contractual obligations. The net financial
result was an $18.5 million gain (principally  cash received),  driven primarily
by the settlement of a multi-year obligation Microsoft had to connect our stores
with broadband capabilities.

NOTE 13 - INCOME TAXES
Deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  as of December  31,  2004 and 2003,  were
comprised of the following:

We anticipate that we will generate  sufficient  pre-tax income in the future to
realize  the  full  benefit  of U.S.  deferred  tax  assets  related  to  future
deductible  amounts.  Accordingly,  a valuation  allowance  was not  required at
December 31, 2004 or 2003.  Our tax returns are subject to examination by taxing
authorities in various jurisdictions.  The Internal Revenue Service is currently
in the process of concluding  its  examination of our federal income tax returns
for the taxable years from 1993 through 2001.  Several states are also currently
in the process of examining our state income tax returns. We record tax reserves
based  on  our  best   estimate  of  current  tax   exposures  in  the  relevant
jurisdictions.  While we believe that the reserves  recorded in the consolidated
financial  statements  accurately  reflect  our tax  exposures,  our  actual tax
liabilities may ultimately  differ from those estimates if we prevail in matters
for which accruals have been established,  or if taxing authorities successfully
challenge the tax treatment  upon which our  management has based its estimates.
Accordingly,  our  effective  tax rate for a  particular  period may  materially
change.

The  American  Jobs  Creation  Act of 2004 ("AJC  Act") was  signed  into law on
October 22, 2004,  and  provides a one-time  elective  incentive  to  repatriate
foreign earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction,  reducing the
effective  federal  income  tax rate on such  earnings  from 35% to  5.25%.  The
earnings  must be reinvested  in the U.S.  under a qualified  plan that has been
approved  by our CEO and Board of  Directors.  We are  currently  assessing  the
impact  that the AJC Act  might  have  with  respect  to our  foreign  earnings,
primarily  in Asia.  We are unable to  quantify  any tax  benefit  that might be
received from the  repatriation  of our foreign  earnings in the future,  or the
effect this repatriation  might have on our effective tax rate.  However,  we do
not  expect  that any  repatriation  would  materially  affect  our  results  of
operations or financial position.

NOTE 14 - LITIGATION
On July 28,  2003,  we  received  payment of $15.7  million  resulting  from the
favorable  settlement  of a lawsuit we had  previously  filed.  We recorded this
settlement  in the  accompanying  Consolidated  Statement of Income in the third
quarter of 2003 as other income of $10.7 million,  net of legal expenses of $5.0
million paid as a result of the lawsuit.

In October  2002, a court  approved the final  settlement  of $29.9 million in a
class action lawsuit, which was originally filed in March 2000 in Orange County,
California.  Actual  payments  under this lawsuit  totaled  $29.0  million.  The
lawsuit related to the alleged  miscalculation  of overtime wages for certain of
our former and current employees in that state.
<PAGE>

Additionally,  in the second  quarter of 2002,  we  received  payments  of $27.7
million  in  partial  settlement  of  amounts  owed to us  under  a tax  sharing
agreement that was the subject of an arbitration  styled Tandy  Corporation  and
T.E.  Electronics,  Inc. vs. O'Sullivan  Industries Holdings,  Inc. This partial
settlement  followed a ruling in RadioShack's  favor by the  arbitration  panel.
This  arbitration  was commenced in July 1999 and the  settlement  also requires
O'Sullivan to make ongoing  payments  under this tax sharing  agreement that was
entered into by the parties at the time of O'Sullivan's initial public offering.

We are  currently a party to various  class  action  lawsuits  alleging  that we
misclassified  certain  RadioShack  store  managers as exempt  from  overtime in
violation of the Fair Labor  Standards Act,  including a lawsuit styled Alphonse
L. Perez, et al. v. RadioShack Corporation,  filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  While the alleged damages in these
lawsuits are  undetermined,  they could be substantial.  We believe that we have
meritorious defenses, and we are vigorously defending these cases.  Furthermore,
we fully expect these cases to be  favorably  determined  as a matter of federal
law. If,  however,  an adverse  resolution of any of these lawsuits  occurs,  we
believe they could have a material  adverse  effect on our results of operations
for the year in which resolution occurs. However, we do not believe that such an
adverse  resolution  would have a material impact on our financial  condition or
liquidity.  The  liability,  if any,  associated  with  these  lawsuits  was not
determinable at December 31, 2004.

We have various other pending  claims,  lawsuits,  disputes with third  parties,
investigations and actions incidental to the operation of our business. Although
occasional  adverse  settlements or resolutions may occur and negatively  impact
earnings  in the  period or year of  settlement,  it is our  belief  that  their
ultimate  resolution  will not have a material  adverse  effect on our financial
condition or liquidity.

NOTE 15 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Lease  Commitments:  We lease rather than own most of our facilities.  Our lease
agreements  expire at various dates through  January 2016.  Some of these leases
are subject to renewal  options and provide for the payment of taxes,  insurance
and maintenance. Our retail locations comprise the largest portion of our leased
facilities.  These  locations are primarily in major shopping malls and shopping
centers owned by other companies. Some leases are based on a minimum rental plus
a  percentage  of the  store's  sales in  excess  of a  stipulated  base  figure
("Contingent  Rent").  Certain leases contain escalation  clauses. We also lease
distribution  centers and office space.  Additionally,  we lease automobiles and
information systems equipment.

Future  minimum  rent   commitments  at  December  31,  2004,   under  long-term
non-cancelable  operating  leases (net of  immaterial  amounts of sublease  rent
income) are included in the following table.

Future  minimum  rent  commitments  in  the  table  above  exclude  future  rent
obligations  associated with stores closed under the 1996 and 1997 restructuring
plan. Estimated payments to settle future rent obligations associated with these
stores have been accrued in the restructuring reserve (see Note 10).

<PAGE>

From time to time, we enter into store operating leases that provide for free or
reduced rental  periods,  usually during the finish-out of our retail  locations
before the store opens for business.  These periods are commonly  referred to as
"rent holidays" and average 60 days. Prior to January 2005, we did not recognize
straight-line rent expense during the pre-opening rent holiday period but rather
began recording rent expense from the day the store opened. Beginning January 1,
2005, we have changed our accounting policy by including the rent holiday period
in our  straight-line  rent  calculation.  We do not believe that this change in
policy  will have a material  effect on our future  consolidated  statements  of
income  or  balance  sheets,  and  will  have  no  effect  on  our  cash  flows.
Furthermore,  we believe that the impact of our prior accounting for pre-opening
rent holiday periods on current and prior periods is immaterial and therefore no
accounting adjustments are necessary or have been made.

Contingent Liabilities:  We have contingent liabilities related to retail leases
of  locations  which were  assigned to other  businesses.  The majority of these
contingent  liabilities relate to various lease obligations  arising from leases
that were  assigned to CompUSA,  Inc. as part of the sale of our Computer  City,
Inc.  subsidiary  to CompUSA,  Inc. in August 1998.  In the event CompUSA or the
other  assignees,  as applicable,  are unable to fulfill these  obligations,  we
would be responsible  for rent due under the leases.  Our rent exposure from the
remaining  undiscounted  lease commitments with no projected  sublease income is
approximately $154 million.  However,  we have no reason to believe that CompUSA
or the other assignees will not fulfill their  obligations under these leases or
that we would be  unable  to  sublet  the  properties;  consequently,  we do not
believe there will be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
as a result of the eventual resolution of these lease obligations.

Purchase Obligations: We have purchase obligations of $485.9 million at December
31,  2004,  which  include our product  commitments,  marketing  agreements  and
freight commitments. Of this amount, $464.2 million relates to 2005.

NOTE 16 - STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS
We have implemented several plans to award employees  stock-based  compensation.
Under the Incentive Stock Plans ("ISPs")  described below, the exercise price of
options must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share of our
common stock on the date of grant.  The 1997,  1999 and 2001 ISPs each terminate
after ten years;  no option or award may be granted under the ISPs after the ISP
termination date. The Management  Development and Compensation  Committee of our
Board of Directors  specifies  the terms for grants of options under these ISPs;
terms of these options may not exceed 10 years. Grants of options generally vest
over three years and grants  typically have a term of seven or 10 years.  Option
agreements  issued  under the ISPs  generally  provide  that,  in the event of a
change in  control,  all  options  become  immediately  and  fully  exercisable.
Repricing or exchanging  options for lower priced options is not permitted under
the ISPs without shareholder approval.

In 2004 the  stockholders  approved the RadioShack 2004 Deferred Stock Unit Plan
for Non-Employee  Directors  ("Deferred  Plan").  The Deferred Plan replaced the
one-time and annual stock option grants to non-employee directors  ("Directors")
as  specified  in the 1997,  1999 and 2001 ISPs.  New  Directors  will receive a
one-time grant of 5,000  deferred stock units  ("Units") on the date they attend
their first Board  meeting.  Each Director who has served one year or more as of
June 1 of any year  will  automatically  be  granted  3,500  Units on the  first
business day of June of each year in which he or she serves as a Director. Under
the Deferred  Plan,  one-third of the Units vest  annually over three years from
the date of grant.  Vesting may be accelerated under certain  circumstances.  At
termination  of service,  death,  disability or change in control of RadioShack,
Directors  will  receive  shares of common  stock  equal to the number of vested
Units.  Directors  may  receive  these  shares  in a lump sum or they may  defer
receipt of these shares in equal installments over a period of up to ten years.

A brief description of each our stock plans follows:

     1993 Incentive Stock Plan ("1993 ISP"): The 1993 ISP permitted the grant of
     up to 12.0 million shares in the form of incentive stock options ("ISOs"),
     non-qualified stock options (options which are not ISOs) ("NQs") and
     restricted stock. There were no shares available on December 31, 2004, for
     grants under the 1993 ISP. The 1993 ISP expired March 28, 2003, and no
     further grants may be made under this plan.
<PAGE>

     1994 Stock Incentive Plan ("1994 SIP"): As part of our purchase of
     AmeriLink in 1999 (see Note 6), we assumed the existing AmeriLink 1994
     Stock Incentive Plan and certain related agreements and agreed to convert
     AmeriLink's stock options to stock options to purchase our stock, subject
     to an agreed upon exchange ratio and conversion price. Thus, the AmeriLink
     1994 SIP was assumed and adopted by us in 1999. All options in the 1994 SIP
     were fully vested on the date of transition and management has determined
     that no further grants will be made under this plan; there were no shares
     available for grant at December 31, 2004,     under the 1994 SIP. There
     were also certain restricted stock agreements that were assumed by us at
     the time of acquisition. On September 10, 2003, we sold AmeriLink.

     1997 Incentive Stock Plan ("1997 ISP"): The 1997 ISP permits the grant of
     up to 11.0 million shares in the form of ISOs, NQs and restricted stock.
     The 1997 ISP provides that the maximum number of shares of our common stock
     that an eligible employee may receive in any calendar year with respect to
     options may not exceed 1.0 million shares. There were 705,944 shares
     available on December 31, 2004, for grants under the 1997 ISP.

     1999 Incentive Stock Plan ("1999 ISP"): The 1999 ISP permits the grant of
     up to 9.5 million shares in the form of NQs. Grants of restricted stock,
     performance awards and options intended to qualify as ISO's under the
     Internal Revenue Code are not authorized under the 1999 ISP. The 1999 ISP
     provides that the maximum number of shares of our common stock that an
     eligible employee may receive in any calendar year with respect to options
     may not exceed 1.0 million shares. There were 493,316 shares available on
     December 31, 2004, for grants under the 1999 ISP.

     2001 Incentive Stock Plan ("2001 ISP"): The 2001 ISP permits the grant of
     up to 9.2 million shares in the form of ISOs and NQs. The 2001 ISP provides
     that the maximum number of shares of our common stock that an eligible
     employee may receive in any calendar year with respect to options may not
     exceed 0.5 million shares. There were 5,613,018 shares available on
     December 31, 2004, for grants under the 2001 ISP.

Restricted Stock: We may also use restricted stock grants to compensate  certain
of our  employees.  As of December 31, 2004, no shares of restricted  stock were
outstanding.  Compensation  expense  related to restricted  shares is recognized
ratably  over the  related  service  period.  There was no expense for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002.

NOTE 17 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
The Executive  Deferred  Compensation Plan and the Executive Deferred Stock Plan
("Compensation  Plans")  became  effective on April 1, 1998.  These plans permit
employees  who are  corporate  or division  officers to defer up to 80% of their
base salary and/or bonuses.  Certain executive  officers may defer up to 100% of
their base salary and/or bonuses.  In addition,  officers are permitted to defer
delivery of any  restricted  stock or stock  acquired  under an NQ exercise that
would  otherwise  vest. Cash deferrals may be made in our common stock or mutual
funds; however, restricted stock deferrals and deferrals of stock acquired under
an NQ exercise may only be made in our common stock.  We match 12% of salary and
bonus deferrals in the form of our common stock. We will match an additional 25%
of salary and bonus  deferrals if the deferral period exceeds five years and the
deferrals are invested in our common stock. Payment of deferrals will be made in
cash or our common stock in accordance with the employee's specifications at the
time of the  deferral;  payments  to the  employee  will be in a lump  sum or in
annual installments not to exceed 20 years.

We contributed  $0.9 million,  $0.4 million and $0.5 million to the Compensation
Plans for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

NOTE 18 - TERMINATION PROTECTION PLANS
In August  1990 and in May 1995,  our Board of  Directors  approved  termination
protection   plans  and  amendments  to  the   termination   protection   plans,
respectively. These plans provide for defined termination benefits to be paid to
our eligible  employees who have been  terminated,  without  cause,  following a
change in control of our  company.  In  addition,  for a certain  period of time
following  an  employee's  termination,  we, at our  expense,  must  continue to
provide on behalf of the terminated  employee certain  employment  benefits.  In
general,  during the twelve  months  following a change in  control,  we may not
terminate  or change  existing  employee  benefit  plans in any way which  would
affect accrued  benefits or decrease the rate of our  contribution to the plans.
There have been no payments under these protection plans for the years shown.
<PAGE>

NOTE 19 - RADIOSHACK INVESTMENT PLAN
On April 30, 2004,  we amended our employee  stock  purchase plan and renamed it
the  RadioShack   Investment  Plan  (the  "Investment   Plan").  Only  employees
participating  in the former plan as of April 29, 2004,  may  participate in the
Investment Plan. New employees are not eligible to participate in the Investment
Plan. Participants contribute from 1% to 7% of their annual compensation,  based
on the amount of their  election in the employee stock purchase plan as of April
29, 2004.  Participants  may  decrease,  but not  increase,  the amount of their
election.  Participants may annually elect to receive their contributions either
in the  form of cash or our  common  stock.  We  match  40%,  60% or 80% of each
participant's contribution,  depending on the participant's length of continuous
participation  in the employee  stock  purchase plan as of April 29, 2004.  This
matching  contribution is in the form of either cash or our common stock,  based
on the  participant's  election  to receive his or her  contribution  in cash or
common stock,  as described  above.  Our  contributions  to the Investment  Plan
amounted to $13.6  million,  $15.4 million and $15.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

NOTE 20 - RADIOSHACK 401(k) PLAN
The  RadioShack  401(k) Plan  ("401(k)  Plan") is a defined  contribution  plan.
Eligible  employees  may direct  their  contributions  into  various  investment
options,  including  investing in our common stock.  Participants may defer, via
payroll deductions,  1% to 15% of their annual compensation;  however,  officers
may only defer from 1% to 8% of their  annual  compensation.  Contributions  per
participant  are limited to certain  annual  maximums  permitted by the Internal
Revenue Code. We presently  contribute an amount to each  participant's  account
maintained under the 401(k) Plan equal to 30% of the participant's contributions
on up to 8% of their annual compensation.  This percentage contribution by us is
discretionary  and may change in future years. Any  contributions by us are made
directly  to the  401(k)  Plan  and  are  made in cash  and  invested  in an age
appropriate  retirement fund for each  participant;  however,  participants  may
immediately  reinvest  our  contribution  into  other  investment   alternatives
provided by the 401(k)  Plan.  Effective  April 1, 2002, a  participant  becomes
fully  vested in the 401(k) Plan  contributions  we made on his on her behalf on
the third anniversary of the participant's  employment date. At January 1, 2004,
the 401(k) Plan year was changed to a calendar year basis.

TESOP  Portion of the 401(k) Plan:  On July 31, 1990,  the trustee of the 401(k)
Plan borrowed $100.0 million at an interest rate of 9.34%;  this amount was paid
off on June 30, 2000 ("TESOP Notes").  The 401(k) Plan trustee used the proceeds
from the 1990 issuance of the TESOP Notes to purchase from us 100,000  shares of
TESOP  Preferred  Stock at a price of $1,000 per share.  In December  1994,  the
401(k) Plan entered into an agreement with an unrelated third-party to refinance
up to $16.7  million  of the TESOP  Notes in a series of six  annual  notes (the
"Refinanced  Notes"),  beginning December 30, 1994. As of December 31, 1999, the
401(k) Plan had borrowed  all of the $16.7  million for the  refinancing  of the
TESOP  Notes.  As of December  31,  2002,  the 401(k) Plan had repaid all of the
Refinanced Notes.  Dividend  payments and  contributions  received by the 401(k)
Plan from us were used to repay the indebtedness.

Each share of TESOP Preferred  Stock was  convertible  into 87.072 shares of our
common stock. The annual cumulative dividend on TESOP Preferred Stock was $75.00
per share, payable semiannually.  Because we had guaranteed the repayment of the
Refinanced  Notes,  the  indebtedness  of the 401(k)  Plan was  recognized  as a
liability in the accompanying  Consolidated Balance Sheets. An offsetting charge
was made in the stockholders'  equity section of the 2001  Consolidated  Balance
Sheet to reflect unearned  compensation  related to the 401(k) Plan. On December
31, 2002,  all shares of TESOP  Preferred  Stock were  converted into our common
stock and all unearned  compensation  related to the Plan was  recognized  as of
that date.
<PAGE>

Compensation  and  interest  expense  related  to the  401(k)  Plan  before  the
reduction for the  allocation  of dividends  are  presented  below for each year
ended December 31:

(In millions)        2004     2003     2002

Accrued additional
 contribution          --       --      4.1
Interest expense       --       --      0.2

The last allocation of TESOP Preferred Stock to participants  was made as of the
401(k) Plan year ended March 31,  2003,  and was based on the total debt service
made on the indebtedness.  As shares of the TESOP Preferred Stock were allocated
to 401(k) Plan  participants,  compensation  expense was  recorded  and unearned
compensation  was reduced.  Interest  expense on the  Refinanced  Notes was also
recognized  as a cost of the 401(k)  Plan.  The  compensation  component  of the
401(k) Plan expense was reduced by the amount of dividends  accrued on the TESOP
Preferred  Stock,  with any  dividends  in  excess of the  compensation  expense
reflected as a reduction of interest expense.

Contributions  made by us to the  401(k)  Plan for the year ended  December  31,
2002,  totaled $4.0 million.  Dividends paid on the TESOP  Preferred  Stock were
$4.5 million.

As of December 31, 2002, all of the original  100,000 shares of TESOP  Preferred
Stock were  converted  into 5.1 million shares of our common stock and allocated
to participants' accounts in the 401(k) Plan.

NOTE 21 - TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In February  2003,  our Board of Directors  authorized a repurchase  program for
15.0 million shares,  which was in addition to our 25.0 million share repurchase
program that was completed  during the second  quarter of 2003. The 15.0 million
share  repurchase  program  has no  expiration  date  and  allows  shares  to be
repurchased in the open market.  We repurchased 6.9 million shares of our common
stock for $210.9  million for the year ended  December 31, 2004,  under the 15.0
million share repurchase  program.  The funding  required for these  repurchases
came from cash generated from net sales and operating revenues and cash and cash
equivalents. We also repurchase shares in the open market to offset the sales of
shares to our employee  benefit  plans.  At February  18,  2005,  there were 2.5
million  shares  available  to be  repurchased  under  the  15.0  million  share
repurchase program.

On February 25, 2005,  our Board of  Directors  approved a new share  repurchase
program. This new program authorizes management to repurchase up to $250 million
in open market purchases and has no expiration date.

NOTE 22 - PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
In July 1999, we amended and restated a stockholder rights plan which declared a
dividend of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock. The rights
plan,  as amended and  restated,  will expire on July 26,  2009.  The rights are
currently  represented by our common stock certificates.  When the rights become
exercisable,  they will entitle each holder to purchase 1/10,000th of a share of
our Series A Junior Participating  Preferred Stock for an exercise price of $250
(subject  to  adjustment).  The rights will  become  exercisable  and will trade
separately from the common stock only upon the date of public  announcement that
a person, entity or group ("Person") has acquired 15% or more of our outstanding
common  stock  without the consent or  approval of the  disinterested  directors
("Acquiring  Person") or ten days after the commencement or public  announcement
of a tender or  exchange  offer  which  would  result in any Person  becoming an
Acquiring Person. In the event that any Person becomes an Acquiring Person,  the
rights will be  exercisable  for 60 days  thereafter for our common stock with a
market value (as  determined  under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise
price.  In the event that,  after any Person  becomes an  Acquiring  Person,  we
engage in certain mergers,  consolidations,  or sales of assets representing 50%
or more of our assets or  earning  power with an  Acquiring  Person (or  Persons
acting on behalf of or in  concert  with an  Acquiring  Person)  or in which all
holders of common stock are not treated  alike,  the rights will be  exercisable
for common stock of the  acquiring or surviving  company with a market value (as
determined  under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise price. The rights
will not be exercisable by any Acquiring Person.  The rights are redeemable at a
price of $0.01 per right prior to any Person  becoming an  Acquiring  Person or,
under certain circumstances, after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person.

NOTE 23 - DIVIDENDS DECLARED
We declared  dividends  of $0.25,  $0.25 and $0.22 for the years 2004,  2003 and
2002,  respectively.  Dividends  declared in 2002 and thereafter  have been paid
annually in December.

The sum of the quarterly net incomes  available per common share amounts may not
total to each full year amount,  since these computations are made independently
for each  quarter  and for the full  year and take  into  account  the  weighted
average number of common stock  equivalent  shares  outstanding for each period,
including the effect of dilutive securities for that period.
