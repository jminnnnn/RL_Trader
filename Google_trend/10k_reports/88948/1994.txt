General Development of Business

SENECA FOODS CORPORATION (herein referred to as the "Company") was
organized in 1949 and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.
On December 20, 1993 the Company acquired certain assets of ERLY Juice,
Inc. and WorldMark, Inc.  This included manufacturing facilities located in
Eau Claire, Michigan. Most of the products are sold under the TreeSweet(r)
brand.  In an unrelated transaction Seneca acquired the Wapato, Washington
juice ingredients business of Sanofi Bio-Industries, Inc. on November 30,
1993.  The Company's textile division was sold during August 1993.

Financial Information About Industry Segments

The  Company's  business  activities are conducted  in  food  and  non-food
segments.  The food segment is food processing.  The non-food segment is an
air charter service.

                     Narrative Description of Business

                      Principal Products and Markets

Food Processing

The  principal  products  of  this segment include  grape  products,  apple
products, and vegetables.  The products are canned, bottled, and frozen and
are  sold to retail and institutional markets.  The Company has divided the
United  States  into  four  major marketing  sections:  Eastern,  Southern,
Northwestern,  and  Southwestern.   Plant  locations  in  New  York,  North
Carolina,  and Washington provide ready access to the domestic  sources  of
grapes  and  apples  necessary  to  support  marketing  efforts  in   their
respective  sections  of  the country.  There  is  also  a  newly  acquired
bottling  plant in Michigan.  Vegetable operations are primarily  supported
by plant locations in New York, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.  In addition, the
Company operates a mushroom canning facility in Pennsylvania.

The following summarizes net sales by major category for the three years
ended July 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992.

Other

Seneca  Flight  Operations  provides  air  charter  service  primarily   to
industries in upstate New York.
                                     
                  Source and Availability of Raw Material

Food Processing

The Company's food processing plants are located in major vegetable, grape,
and apple producing states.  Fruits and vegetables are primarily obtained
through contracts with growers.  Apple concentrate is purchased
domestically and abroad to supplement raw fruit purchased under contract.
The Company's sources of supply are considered equal or superior to its
competition for all of its food products.


                             Seasonal Business

Food Processing

While  individual  fruits  and  vegetables have  seasonal  cycles  of  peak
production and sales, the different cycles are usually offsetting  to  some
extent.  The supply of commodities, current pricing, and expected new  crop
quantity and quality affect the timing of the Company's sales and earnings.
An  Off  Season  Allowance is established during the year to  minimize  the
effect  of  seasonal production on earnings.  This is zero at  fiscal  year
end.


                                  Backlog

Food Processing

In the food processing business the end of year sales order backlog is not
considered meaningful.  Traditionally, larger customers provide tentative
bookings for their expected purchases for the upcoming season.  These
bookings are further developed as data on the expected size of the related
national harvests becomes available.  In general these bookings serve as a
yardstick, rather than as a firm commitment, since actual harvest results
can vary notably from early estimates.  In actual practice, the Company has
substantially all of its expected seasonal production identified to
potential sales outlets before the seasonal production is completed.

                         Competition and Customers

Food Processing

Competition in the food business is substantial with imaginative brand
registration, quality service, and pricing being the major determinants in
the Company's relative market position.  Except for the Seneca apple and
grape products and Libby's vegetable products data mentioned below, no
reliable statistics are available to establish the exact market position of
the Company's own food products.  During the past year approximately 43% of
the Company's processed foods were packed for retail customers under the
Company branded labels of Libby's(r), TreeSweet(r), and Seneca(r).  About 18% of
the processed foods were packed for institutional food distributors and the
remaining 39% of processed foods were retail packed under the private label
of customers.  The customers represent a full cross section of the retail,
institutional, distributor, and industrial markets and the Company does not
consider itself dependent on any single sales source.  The principal
branded products are Seneca Frozen Apple Juice Concentrate, rated the
number one seller nationally, Seneca Frozen Natural Grape Juice
Concentrate, Seneca applesauce, and Libby's canned vegetable products which
rate among the top five national brands.


                         Environmental Protection

Environmental protection is an area that has been worked on most diligently
at each food processing facility.  In all locations the Company has
cooperated with federal, state, and local environmental protection
authorities in developing and maintaining suitable antipollution
facilities.  In general, pollution control facilities are equal to or
somewhat superior to those of our competitors and are within environmental
protection standards.  The Company does not expect any material capital
expenditures to comply with environmental regulations in the near future.

Export sales for the Company are a relatively small portion (less than 3%)
of the food processing sales.

                                Properties

The  Company has ten food processing, packaging, and warehousing facilities
located in New York State that provide approximately 1,067,000 square  feet
of  food  packaging,  freezing and freezer storage, and  warehouse  storage
space.   These facilities process and package fruit and vegetable products.
The  Company is a lessee under a number of operating and capital leases for
equipment and real property used for processing and warehousing.

Five other processing, packaging, and warehousing facilities are located in
the  states  of North Carolina (208,000 square feet), Pennsylvania  (39,000
square   feet)  and  in  Washington  (263,000  square  feet).    Processing
operations in North Carolina are primarily devoted to apple juice products;
in  Washington,  grape juice, apple juice and sauce; and  in  Pennsylvania,
mushroom canning and warehousing.

One facility in Minnesota, one facility in Michigan, and four facilities in
Wisconsin  provide approximately 1,795,000 square feet of  food  packaging,
freezing   and  freezer  storage,  and  warehouse  storage  space.    These
facilities  process and package various vegetable and fruit products.   The
facilities are owned by the Company.

The  Company  owns three food distribution facilities in Massachusetts  and
New York totaling approximately 400,000 square feet which are leased out to
another company through 1995-97.

Substantially  all of the properties are well maintained and equipped  with
modern  machinery.   All  locations, although  highly  utilized,  have  the
ability  to expand as sales requirements justify.  Because of the  seasonal
production cycles the exact extent of utilization is difficult to  measure.
In  certain circumstances the theoretical full efficiency levels are  being
reached; however, expansion of the number of production days or hours could
increase the output by up to 20% for a season.

See Note 6 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for
additional information about the Company's lease commitments.

The Company is not involved in any material legal proceedings.

Description of Business

Seneca Foods Corporation conducts its business almost entirely in food
processing which currently contributes about 99% of the Company's sales.  Canned
and frozen vegetables represent 51% of the food processing volume.  Within the
apple products category, which contributed 27% of all processed food sales, the
Company's Seneca(r) brand frozen apple concentrate continues its position as the
nation's number one seller.  Of the remaining food processing sales, grape
products account for 6%, and bottled, canned, and frozen fruit juice drinks
account for the remaining 16%.

Approximately 43% of the Company's food products are packed under its own brands
including Seneca(r),  Libby's(r) and TreeSweet(r).  About 39% of the processed 
foods are packed under private labels with the remaining 18% sold to 
institutional food distributors.

The Company also operates a non-food division which contributes about 1% to the
Company's sales.  Seneca Flight Operations provides air charter service
primarily to industries located in upstate New York.

Note -- The Company's textile division was sold during August, 1993.

To Our Fellow Shareholders:

Fiscal 1994 was a busy and successful year for Seneca
Foods.  The Company was able to post a healthy profit
and grew both case and dollar sales.  This was due
primarily to the sharply higher vegetable selling
prices, the reasonably normal fruit crop conditions and
the addition of two small acquisitions.  Earnings from
continuing operations were $5,341,000, up 69.4% over
1993.  In addition, we had several non-recurring items
which affected 1994 earnings.  The sale of the
Company's textile subsidiary resulted in an after-tax
gain of $2,273,000.  Also, a required accounting change
for recognizing deferred taxes was implemented which
resulted in a $2,006,000 gain.  Lastly, the Company
paid an early payment penalty on a large piece of high
interest, long-term debt which was repaid in 1994,
resulting in an after-tax extraordinary loss of
$606,000.  The net result of all of these items was net
earnings of $9,104,000 or $3.13 per share versus
$4,118,000 or $1.33 per share in 1993.  Net sales were
up 12.7% in 1994 to $290,185,000 versus 1993's sales of
$257,402,000.

As we mentioned before, selling prices in vegetables
were sharply higher due to 1993's summer flooding in
the midwest.  This flooding caused an industrywide
shortage of virtually all types of canned and frozen
vegetables.  While our costs were higher as a result,
this increase was more than offset by the higher
selling prices.  In addition, nearly one-third of
Seneca's vegetable pack is produced in New York State,
which had almost ideal growing conditions last summer.
Consequently, our above budget packs in New York
contributed handsomely to our bottom line.

Our juice business also grew in terms of sales and
profits, helped by lower raw material costs.  During
the past several years, increasing apple and grape
juice prices had led to the introduction of a variety
of less expensive non-100% juice alternatives, such as
fruit-flavored drinks, to meet the needs of  price-
conscious consumers.  Today, our products are once
again very price competitive versus these non-100%
juice alternatives.

In addition, we made two strategic acquisitions in our
juice business.  In November, we purchased a small,
profitable, juice ingredients business in Washington
State that was folded into our Western Division.  One
month later, we purchased the citrus juice business of
ERLY Industries which included a bottling plant in
Michigan and distribution of canned, frozen and bottled
orange and grapefruit juices under the TreeSweet Brand
name.  This acquisition permits Seneca to offer its
customers citrus juice products in addition to our
traditional apple, grape and cranberry juice products.
Most of this production was moved efficiently into our
five bottling facilities around the country.

After the close of the year, we purchased the Nature's
Favorite Apple Chip business from Mitsubishi Foods,
Inc.  This is a niche snack food business with a state-
of-the-art manufacturing facility in Yakima,
Washington.  We expect this business to contribute
modestly to our bottom line in 1995, and hope to
leverage our sales and marketing expertise to build
sales over time.

A major accomplishment in 1994 was the successful
implementation of the Nutritional Labeling and
Education Act that required that we put nutritional
statements on all of our food products.  While we
welcome the law, which will highlight to the consumer
the positive nutritional value of Seneca's products,
the logistics of compliance was a costly and time
consuming project for Seneca and the entire industry.

As we look to 1995, the vegetable pack has been
excellent thus far and we are rapidly filling the
depleted pipeline of inventories into the grocery
stores.  Our expectations are for continuing growth in
sales which will include the full year impact of the
acquisitions, as well as the more modest growth of our
core business.  It is, however, still too early to say
just how our bottom line will be affected by this
year's crops.
Finally, let us thank Seneca's employees who put in
many long hours this year managing the expansion of our
business.  Our strategy of having modern plants and
dedicated employees has served the Company well for
over forty-five years.  Consequently, we believe we are
well positioned to take advantage of further growth
opportunities and handle the commodity cycles in our
business.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Because of the food processing segment, the Company's
yearly business cycle shows large inventory growth
during the summer and fall harvest period.  The
inventory peaks in the early winter and drops to its
minimum level  about the fiscal year end.  These peaks
are financed through seasonal borrowings whose high and
low points essentially correspond with the changes in
inventory, or by a reduction in short-term investments.
Accordingly, inventory management is key to liquidity.

During 1994 the Company prepaid an issue of high
interest long-term debt totaling $13.8 million.  This
resulted in an extraordinary loss of $0.6 million after
taxes.  Also during 1994 the Company made two small
acquisitions totaling $11.7 million.  The debt
prepayment and acquisitions were funded by the proceeds
from the sale of the textile division (see below) and
current operations.  During 1994 and 1993 the Company
had no new long-term financing.  During 1992 the
Company began refunding $22.6 million of tax exempt
industrial revenue bonds that was completed in 1993
(see Long-Term Debt, note 5).  The Company maintained
unsecured lines of credit totaling $90.0 million, with
peak borrowings reaching $7.0 million during 1994.  All
credit lines provide for interest below prime rates.
There were $1.6 million of  borrowings outstanding
under these lines at the end of 1994 and none for years
1993 and 1992.

The increase in cash and short-term investments of $0.5
million over the three year period ended in 1994 was
primarily due to proceeds from the disposal of the
textile segment of $8.4 million; an income tax refund
in 1993 of $4.2 million; and net earnings. This was
offset by the debt prepayment of $13.8 million; two
small acquisitions totaling $11.7 million; the common
stock retirement of $5.1 million; capital additions of
$9.4 million, $1.7 million, and $8.7 million in 1994,
1993, and 1992, respectively; and smaller items not
identified.

During 1994 capital expenditures were higher than both
1993 and 1992.  During 1994 the Company upgraded its
vegetable processing and juice bottling equipment in
the Eastern Division.  During 1992 the Company upgraded
a portion of its can manufacturing equipment in the
midwest.

During August 1993 the Company sold its textile
division for approximately $8.4 million.  It
represented about 6% of the Company's assets and 13% of
the Company's sales in 1993.

Results of Operations

The Company's sales from continuing operations of
$290.2 million in 1994 represent an increase of 12.7%
over last year's results.  Sales decreased 8.0% in 1993
and decreased 0.1% in 1992.

In 1994 vegetable sales increased 9.5% due to sharply
higher unit selling prices that resulted from 1993's
flooding in the midwest.  In 1994 fruit and juice sales
were up 16.7% led by apple juice which was up 9.3%.
The two small acquisitions also contributed to the
increase (see Acquisitions, note 13).  In 1993
vegetable sales declined 12.4% due to lower unit sales
and selling prices while apple and grape sales declined
by 8.4% and 2.1%, respectively.  This was partially
offset by an increase in co-pack sales.  Vegetable
sales decreased due, in part, to a continued oversupply
of processed vegetables in the industry.  In 1992
vegetable sales increased due to greater unit sales
while apple and grape sales declined.  Apple sales in
1992 declined due to the second consecutive year of the
worldwide apple shortage.

In 1994 earnings increased for the following reasons:
1) lower apple cost of product sold due to a greater
availability of apples, 2) higher selling prices on
vegetables which more than offset higher cost of goods
sold, 3) the sale of the textile segment and, 4) the
$2.0 million gain due to implementing Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes (see Income Taxes, note 7).  In 1993
earnings increased for the following reasons:  1) lower
apple cost of product sold due to a greater
availability of apples, 2) lower interest cost since
there were lower short-term rates, 3) the refinancing
mentioned below and, 4) the $1.7 million of interest
income from the Internal Revenue Service (see Income
Taxes, note 7).  In 1992 earnings decreased due, in
part, to lower selling prices caused by an industrywide
oversupply of processed vegetables.  In addition a
major shortage of processing apples in Europe and the
U. S. caused unprecedented increases in the cost of
goods sold which resulted in lower earnings.  The 1992
earnings included an extraordinary loss of $0.5 million
(after tax benefit) related to a prepayment penalty
paid for early extinguishment of Industrial Revenue
Bonds and accelerated amortization of their deferred
financing costs.  Interest savings in the first year
more than offset the costs of refinancing (see
Long-Term Debt, note 5).

In general, inflation played a relatively small role in
the operating results and cash flows of 1994, 1993, and
1992 since the Company values its inventories on a
last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis and depreciates its
fixed assets under accelerated depreciation methods for
tax purposes.

Accounting for Equity Securities - SFAS 115

The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently
issued SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities.  The Company will adopt
this statement, as required, in the first quarter of
1995.  Based on the current situation with the Common
Stock of Moog Inc., under this statement the Company's
investment would be classified as available-for-sale
securities and thus reported at fair value, with the
unrealized gain reported as a separate component of
equity.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Seneca Foods Corporation and Subsidiaries

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts for the parent Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries
after elimination of intercompany transactions, profits, and balances.

Revenue Recognition - Sales and related cost of product sold are recognized
primarily upon shipment of products.

Concentration of Credit Risk - Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to credit risk consist of trade receivables and interest-bearing
investments.  Wholesale and retail food distributors comprise a significant
portion of the trade receivables; collateral is not required.  The risk
associated with the concentration is limited due to the large number of
wholesalers and retailers and their geographic dispersion.

The Company places substantially all its interest-bearing investments with
financial institutions and monitors credit exposure.

Cash and Short-Term Investments - For purposes of the statement of cash
flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased for a
maturity of three months or less as short-term investments.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at lower of cost; last-in, first-out
(LIFO); or market.

Income Taxes - Effective August 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes which requires  the use of the liability method
of accounting for deferred income taxes.  The provision for income taxes
includes federal, foreign, and state income taxes currently payable and those
deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and
tax bases of assets and liabilities.

Depreciation - Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost or, in the
case of capital leases, the present value of future lease payments.  For
financial reporting, the Company provides for depreciation and capital lease
amortization on the straight-line method at rates based upon the estimated
useful lives of the various assets.

Earnings per Common Share - Primary earnings per share are calculated on the
basis of weighted average common shares outstanding since the effect of
common stock equivalents is immaterial.  The difference between primary and
fully diluted earnings per share is also immaterial.

2.  Inventories

The replacement value of the LIFO based inventory was $99,647,000 at July 31,
1994, and $88,864,000 at July 31, 1993.

3.  Common Stock of Moog Inc.

The Company's investment in the common stock of Moog Inc. is carried at the
lower of aggregate cost or market.  The market value of these securities was
$6,787,000 as of July 31, 1994 and $6,179,000 as of July 31, 1993.  There
were no realized gains or losses in 1994, 1993, or 1992, and unrealized gains
of $708,000 at July 31, 1994 and $100,000 at July 31, 1993.  The Company owns
about 7% of the voting stock of Moog Inc. as of July 31, 1994.  The Company
has the ability and intent to hold these securities for the foreseeable
future.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued SFAS 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.  The
Company will adopt this statement, as required, in the first quarter of 1995.
Based on the current situation with the Common Stock of Moog Inc., under this
statement the Company's investment would be classified as available-for-sale
securities and thus reported at fair value, with the unrealized gain reported
as a separate component of equity.

4.  Lines of Credit

The Company obtains required short-term funds through bank borrowings.  At
July 31, 1994, the Company had $4,660,000 outstanding for letters of credit
and lines of credit totaling $90,000,000.

The lines are renewable annually at various dates and provide for loans of
varying maturities at rates below prime.  There are no formal compensating
balance arrangements with any of the banks.

Selected details are as follows:

                                          1994         1993          1992

                                                (In thousands of dollars)
Borrowings at year end:
    Amount                              $1,600            -             -
    Interest rate                         5.34  %         -             -
Maximum borrowings
  during the year                       $7,000      $38,300       $40,500
Average borrowings
  during the year:
    Amount                              $  158      $14,703       $22,563
    Interest rate                         4.53  %      4.17 %        5.44 %

The average borrowings were computed by dividing the total daily outstanding
balances by 365 days.  The average interest rate was computed by dividing the
actual interest expense by the average borrowings.

5.  Long-Term Debt

The Company has four Industrial Revenue Bonds ("IRB's") totalling $22,630,000
which are secured by direct pay letters of credit.

Debt agreements provide, among other things, that the Company may pay
dividends on common stock only from consolidated net earnings available for
distribution.  There was $4,748,000 of earnings available for distribution as
of July 31, 1994.  The debt agreements also require the maintenance of
$51,000,000 in working capital and limit outstanding short-term borrowings to
$50,000,000 at any one time.  All provisions have been met at July 31, 1994.

Debt repayment requirements for the next five fiscal years are:

               (In thousands)
            1995          $  6,184

            1999             3,701

During 1994 the Company paid off its 13.25% note payable to the insurance
company.  The prepayment penalty paid for the early extinguishment of the
debt totaled $918,000, before the applicable income tax benefit of $312,000
which has been accounted for as a net extraordinary loss of $606,000.

6.  Leases

The Company leases a portion of its equipment and buildings.  Capitalized
leases consist primarily of industrial development agency financing
instruments which bear interest rates ranging from 4.71% to 6.75%.  Other
leases include non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates
through 2005.

Leased assets under capital leases consist of the following:

7.  Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated income tax return.  The provision for
income taxes includes the effect of continuing and discontinued operations
and the extraordinary items as follows:

                               1994      1993      1992

In August 1992 the Internal Revenue Service completed its audit of fiscal
years 1983 and 1984.  This conclusion allowed the Company to file a refund
claim for the years 1985 and 1986.  This refund was received during the
1993 fiscal year resulting in a $1,000,000 reduction in the provision for
income taxes.  Also in 1993, interest income of $1,680,000 has been netted
against the interest expense category in the Consolidated Statements of Net
Earnings.

The cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS 109 on August 1, 1993 was
$2,006,000.  This change is reported in the current Consolidated Statements
of Net Earnings.  As permitted under this rule, prior years financial
statements have not been restated to apply the provisions of SFAS 109.

SFAS 109 is an asset and liability approach to deferred income taxes.  It
requires the recognition of deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax
effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities for financial purposes and income tax purposes.

A reconciliation of the expected U.S. statutory rate to the effective rate
follows:

                                         1994          1993        1992

The following is a summary of the significant components of the Company's
deferred tax assets and liabilities as of July 31, 1994:

    Deferred tax liability                     $  9,327

Net current assets of $1,194,000 and net non-current liabilities of
$10,521,000 are recognized in the balance sheet for the current year. As
required by SFAS 109, the deferred tax asset was recorded on the balance
sheet as a current asset.  Prior to SFAS 109, it was netted against the
long-term deferred income tax liability.

Prior to the change in accounting methods, the sources of deferred tax
items and the corresponding tax effects during 1993 and 1992 were as
follows:

                                    1993          1992

8.  Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock - The outstanding 10% cumulative, convertible, voting
preferred stock consists of 407,240 series A shares, convertible at the
rate of one common share for every twenty preferred shares, and 400,000
series B shares, which carry a one for thirty conversion rate.  The series
A and B shares have a $.25 stated value and a $.025 par value.  There are
2,600,000 shares authorized of Class A $.025 par value stock which are
unissued and undesignated.  In addition there are 30,000 shares of no par
stock which are also unissued and undesignated.

Earnings for the fourth quarter have historically reflected adjustments of
previously estimated raw material costs and production levels.  Due to the
dependence on fruit and vegetable yields of the Company's food processing
segment, interim costing must be estimated.  The volatile nature of inventory
quantities and costs within the food processing segment also necessitates
estimates of interim changes to the Company's LIFO reserve.

10.  Retirement Plan

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering all
employees who meet certain age entry requirements and work a stated minimum
number of hours per year.  Annual contributions are made to the Plan
sufficient to satisfy legal funding requirements.

The projected benefit obligation was determined using an assumed discount
rate of 7% and an assumed long-term salary increase rate of 4%.  The assumed
long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7%.  The Plan holds the Company's
stock with a fair market value of $1,661,000.

11.  Discontinued Operations

In August 1993 the Company completed its sale of the textile division for
$8,400,000 in cash and reported a net gain of $2,273,000 in the first quarter
of 1994.  As a result of the sale, textile operations have been accounted for
as discontinued operations in current and prior periods in the Consolidated
Statements of Net Earnings.

Net sales for the textile division were $2,246,000 in 1994, $43,087,000 in
1993, and $49,265,000 in 1992.  Total assets were $8,400,000 and total
liabilities were $3,500,000 resulting in $4,900,000 of net assets as of the
August 1993 closing.

12.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As of July 31, 1994, the carrying amount and the fair value of the Company's
financial instruments, as determined under SFAS 107, "Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments", were as follows:

                                   Carrying        Estimated
                                    Amount        Fair Value
                                        (In thousands)

Long-term debt, including
   current portion                 $ 56,803        $  60,074
Common stock of Moog Inc.             6,079            6,787
Notes payable                         1,600            1,600

The estimated fair values were determined as follows:

 Long-term debt - The quoted market prices for similar debt or current rates
 offered to the Company for debt with the same maturities.

 Common stock of Moog Inc. - Based on quoted market prices.

 Notes payable - The carrying amount approximates fair value.

13.  Acquisitions

On December 20, 1993 the Company acquired certain assets of ERLY Juice, Inc.
and WorldMark, Inc. This included manufacturing facilities located in Eau
Claire, Michigan. Most of the products are sold under the TreeSweet brand.

In an unrelated transaction Seneca acquired the Wapato, Washington juice
ingredients business of Sanofi Bio-Industries, Inc. on November 30, 1993.

The combined purchase price of these acquisitions was $11,670,000 which was
funded out of working capital.

Both were accounted for under the purchase method and, accordingly, the
operating results of the acquired have been included in the consolidated
operating results since the dates of acquisition.

The following summary, prepared on a pro forma basis, combines the
consolidated results of operations as if ERLY and Sanofi were acquired at the
beginning of the periods presented:

                          1994           1993
                              (Unaudited)
                (In thousands, except per share amounts)

Net sales             $301,121       $318,302

Net earnings from
  continuing operations$ 5,602       $  3,036

Net earnings from
  continuing operations
  per share           $   1.92       $    .98

The 1993 pro forma amounts are based on the prior owners actual sales.  The
1994 pro forma amounts are based on the Company's partial year sales
annualized.

The explanation for the difference is the Company's strategic focus on the
most profitable areas of the acquired businesses.

Subsequent to 1994 year end the Company acquired the assets of M.C. Snack,
Inc. of Yakima, Washington, a snack food maker of apple chips under the
Nature's Favorite Brand. Results of this acquisition, on a pro forma basis,
would not be materially different from the results reported.


Independent Auditors' Report
     
To the Board of Directors
   and Stockholders of
Seneca Foods Corporation
Pittsford, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Seneca Foods
Corporation and subsidiaries as of July 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of net earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 1994.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Seneca Foods Corporation and
subsidiaries as of July 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended July 31, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal
1994 the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes to conform
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109.
