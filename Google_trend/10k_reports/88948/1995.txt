                                    Business

General Development of Business

SENECA FOODS CORPORATION  (herein referred to as the "Company") was organized in
1949 and  incorporated  under the laws of the State of New  York.  Seneca  Foods
Corporation  purchased six Green  Giant(R)  vegetable  plants from The Pillsbury
Company  effective  February 1, 1995,  resulting in vegetable  products becoming
nearly 80% of Seneca's overall  business.  Consequently,  Seneca has changed its
fiscal  year end from  July 31 to March  31 to avoid  overlapping  pack  seasons
between  fiscal  years.  Therefore,  Fiscal 1995 was an  eight-month  transition
period.

Financial Information About Industry Segments

The Company's  business  activities are conducted in food and non-food segments.
The food  segment is food  processing.  The  non-food  segment is an air charter
service.  The air charter service  represents about 1% of the Company's business
and therefore the financial information related to segments is not material.

Narrative Description of Business

Principal Products and Markets

Food Processing

The principal  products of this segment include grape products,  apple products,
and  vegetables.  The products are canned,  bottled,  and frozen and are sold to
retail and institutional markets. The Company has divided the United States into
four  major   marketing   sections:   Eastern,   Southern,   Northwestern,   and
Southwestern.  Plant  locations  in New York,  North  Carolina,  and  Washington
provide ready access to the domestic  sources of grapes and apples  necessary to
support marketing efforts in their respective sections of the country. Vegetable
operations are primarily  supported by plant  locations in New York,  Wisconsin,
Washington,  Idaho, and Minnesota.  In addition, the Company operates a mushroom
canning facility in Pennsylvania.

The following  summarizes  net sales by major  category for the four years ended
March 31, 1995, July 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992.

                    Source and Availability of Raw Material

Food Processing

The Company's food processing plants are located in major vegetable,  grape, and
apple producing  states.  Fruits and vegetables are primarily  obtained  through
contracts with growers.  Apple concentrate is purchased  domestically and abroad
to supplement  raw fruit  purchased  under  contract.  The Company  believes its
sources of supply are considered equal or superior to its competition for all of
its food products.


                               Seasonal Business

Food Processing

While  individual  fruits and vegetables have seasonal cycles of peak production
and sales,  the  different  cycles are usually  offsetting  to some extent.  The
supply of  commodities,  current  pricing,  and expected  new crop  quantity and
quality  affect the timing of the Company's  sales and  earnings.  An Off Season
Allowance  is  established  during the year to  minimize  the effect of seasonal
production on earnings. This is zero at fiscal year end.


                                    Backlog

Food Processing

In the food  processing  business  the end of year  sales  order  backlog is not
considered  meaningful.   Traditionally,   larger  customers  provide  tentative
bookings for their expected  purchases for the upcoming  season.  These bookings
are further  developed  as data on the  expected  size of the  related  national
harvests  becomes  available.  In general these  bookings  serve as a yardstick,
rather than as a firm commitment,  since actual harvest results can vary notably
from early estimates.  In actual practice,  the Company has substantially all of
its expected  seasonal  production  identified to potential sales outlets before
the seasonal production is completed.


                           Competition and Customers

Food Processing

Competition  in  the  food  business  is  substantial  with  imaginative   brand
registration,  quality service,  and pricing being the major determinants in the
Company's  relative  market  position.  Except  for the  Seneca  apple and grape
products  and Libby's  vegetable  products  data  mentioned  below,  no reliable
statistics are available to establish the exact market position of the Company's
own food  products.  During  the past year  approximately  47% of the  Company's
processed  foods were  packed for retail  customers  under the  Company  branded
labels of Libby's(R),  Nature's Favorite(R),  TreeSweet(R), and Seneca(R). About
15% of the processed foods were packed for  institutional  food distributors and
the remaining 38% of processed  foods were retail packed under the private label
of  customers.  The  customers  represent  a full cross  section of the  retail,
institutional,  distributor,  and  industrial  markets and the Company  does not
consider itself dependent on any single sales source. In 1996 and in the future,
The Pillsbury  Company will  represent  our largest  customer as a result of the
20-year supply agreement entered into during 1995.

The principal branded products are Seneca Frozen Apple Juice Concentrate,  rated
the number one seller nationally, Seneca Frozen Natural Grape Juice Concentrate,
Seneca  applesauce,  and Libby's canned vegetable  products which rate among the
top five  national  brands.  The  information  under the heading  Liquidity  and
Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and  Results  of  Operations  in the  1995  Annual  Report  is  incorporated  by
reference.


<PAGE>


                            Environmental Protection

Environmental protection is an area that the Company has worked on diligently at
each food processing facility.  In all locations the Company has cooperated with
federal, state, and local environmental protection authorities in developing and
maintaining suitable antipollution  facilities. In general, the Company believes
its  pollution  control  facilities  are  equal to or  superior  to those of its
competitors and are within environmental  protection standards. The Company does
not  expect any  material  capital  expenditures  to comply  with  environmental
regulations in the near future.


                                                     Employment

                               Foreign Operations

Export sales for the Company are a relatively  small  portion  (less than 3%) of
the food processing sales.


                                     Item 2

                                   Properties

The Company has nine food  processing,  packaging,  and  warehousing  facilities
located in New York State that provide  approximately  1,507,000  square feet of
food packaging, freezing and freezer storage, and warehouse storage space. These
facilities  process and package fruit and vegetable  products.  The Company is a
lessee under a number of operating  and capital  leases for  equipment  and real
property used for processing and warehousing.

Five other processing,  packaging, and warehousing facilities are located in the
states of North  Carolina  (223,000  square feet),  Pennsylvania  (39,000 square
feet),  and in  Washington  (three  locations  totaling  292,000  square  feet).
Processing  operations in North  Carolina are  primarily  devoted to apple juice
products;  in Washington,  grape juice, apple juice, fruit chips, and sauce; and
in Pennsylvania, mushroom canning and warehousing.

Four  facilities  in  Minnesota,  one  facility  in  Michigan,  one  facility in
Washington,  one facility in Idaho,  and seven  facilities in Wisconsin  provide
approximately  4,364,000  square feet of food  packaging,  freezing  and freezer
storage,  and warehouse  storage  space.  These  facilities  process and package
various vegetable and fruit products. The facilities are owned by the Company.

The Company owns three food  distribution  facilities in  Massachusetts  and New
York totaling  approximately 400,000 square feet which are leased out to another
company  through  1995-97.  Sublease  income of $1,333,000 was received on these
facilities  during the eight month period.  In addition the air charter division
has a 14,000 square foot facility.

All of the  properties are well  maintained and equipped with modern  machinery.
Although  highly  utilized,  most  locations have the ability to expand as sales
requirements justify. Because of the seasonal production cycles the exact extent
of utilization is difficult to measure. In certain circumstances the theoretical
full efficiency  levels are being reached;  however,  expansion of the number of
production days or hours could increase the output by up to 20% for a season.

Certain of the Company's  facilities are mortgaged to financial  institutions to
secure long-term debt and capital leases obligations.  See Notes 5 and 6 of Item
8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about
the Company's lease commitments.

Description of Business

Seneca  Foods  Corporation   conducts  its  business  almost  entirely  in  food
processing which currently  contributes about 99% of the Company's sales. Canned
and frozen vegetables  represent 51% of the food processing  volume.  Within the
apple products category,  which contributed 27% of all processed food sales, the
Company's Seneca(R) brand frozen apple concentrate continues its position as the
nation's  number one seller.  Of the  remaining  food  processing  sales,  grape
products  account for 4%, and  bottled,  canned,  and frozen  fruit juice drinks
account for the remaining 18%.

Approximately 47% of the Company's food products are packed under its own brands
including Seneca(R),  Libby's(R),  Nature's Favorite(R) and TreeSweet(R).  About
38% of the processed  foods are packed under  private  labels with the remaining
15% sold to institutional food distributors.

The Company also operates a non-food  division which contributes about 1% to the
Company's sales. Seneca Flight Operations provides air charter service primarily
to industries located in upstate New York.

To our Fellow Shareholders

Fiscal 1995 was a busy year for the Company.  While the Company had  substantial
revenue growth, margins were squeezed by an oversupply of vegetables due to last
summer's bumper crops.

The  biggest  highlight  of 1995  was the  formation  of our  Alliance  with The
Pillsbury  Company whereby Seneca  purchased six vegetable plants from Pillsbury
and signed a 20 year agreement  under which Seneca becomes the primary  supplier
of Green Giant canned and frozen vegetables to Pillsbury.

As a result of the Alliance, we have implemented a change in our fiscal year-end
from July 31st to March 31st. We had long struggled with closing our fiscal year
on July 31st, which was well into the vegetable pack season.  However,  with the
Pillsbury  Alliance,  our  vegetable  revenues  will grow to nearly 80% of total
revenues.  By moving our fiscal year end to March, we will avoid overlapping the
pack season which begins in April with asparagus.

Consequently, fiscal 1995 is an eight month period. For the eight months, Seneca
earned $1,184,000 or $.42 per share on revenues of $234,073,000.  In fiscal 1994
for twelve months, Seneca's earnings from continuing operations were $5,341,000,
or $1.84 per share, on revenues of $290,185,000.

As we mentioned earlier, the harvest last summer was more bountiful than anytime
in recent  memory.  Weather  conditions  were  ideal,  and Seneca as well as its
competitors  had very successful  pack seasons.  Unfortunately  in our business,
this often leads to price pressures as supply outstrips  demand. We aggressively
sold our vegetables  throughout the year and are entering the new pack season in
a reasonable inventory position.

On the juice side of the business,  Seneca took advantage of low apple raw stock
prices to increase  its #1 share in the frozen  concentrated  apple juice market
and built both share and  distribution  in shelf stable apple juice.  Our grape,
cranberry and citrus juices also did well in 1995.

On February 1st, we completed our  aforementioned  transaction  with  Pillsbury.
This  project  involved  the  closing  of four  Pillsbury  plants and moving the
production  into both  Seneca  plants and former  Pillsbury  plants now owned by
Seneca.  We are investing over $50 million in this project.  When completed,  we
will have significantly increased the efficiencies and capacities of our plants.
Much of the  investment  is  going  into  dry  and  frozen  warehousing  and new
state-of-the-art  production  and  harvesting  equipment.  In fact,  the  entire
project will be completed with very little additional  manufacturing space being
constructed.

We believe the Alliance is a prime  example of how two companies can blend their
core  competencies to make the combined  business more  efficient.  Seneca has a
strong  manufacturing  expertise,  while Pillsbury has a strong marketing focus.
Our joint  relationship  has already created cost savings and other benefits for
both parties.

As we look to the immediate future, we are working  feverishly to get the plants
ready  before  the pack  season.  Weather  has thus far been mixed with cool wet
weather in the Midwest impeding our planting  schedule,  and with dry weather in
New York potentially effecting the yields this summer. Nevertheless, it is still
far to early to attempt to predict the final crop outcome.

Our Company is unusual for a company our size in that a significant  part of our
stock  is  owned  by  management.   Consequently,   we  pay  less  attention  to
quarter-to-quarter performance, rather we focus on the long haul. Our goal is to
invest in the people and in the plants  that will place us in the  forefront  of
our peers in the industry.

As part of this strategy,  we are asking our shareholders to approve a new class
of stock which would be distributed as a stock dividend  giving one share of the
new class for each share of Common  Stock you  currently  hold.  This stock will
carry nearly all of the rights of the current Common Stock;  but will carry only
1/20th of the vote of the current Common Stock. This distribution of shares will
increase the financing flexibility of the Company.

Finally,  thank you to the many Seneca Employees who have put in long hours this
past year to help us meet our ambitious objectives.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Because of the food  processing  segment,  the Company's  yearly  business cycle
shows large  inventory  growth  during the summer and fall harvest  period.  The
inventory  peaks in the early winter and drops to its minimum level  immediately
prior to the next  pack  season.  These  peaks  are  financed  through  seasonal
borrowings whose high and low points essentially  correspond with the changes in
inventory, or by a reduction in short-term investments.  Accordingly,  inventory
management is key to liquidity.

During February 1995 the Company acquired certain assets (see Acquisitions, note
13) of the  Green  Giant  division  of The  Pillsbury  Company  (referred  to as
"Pillsbury"), a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan Incorporated. Under an Alliance
Agreement concurrently executed by the Company, Pillsbury and Grand Metropolitan
Incorporated,  Pillsbury will continue to be  responsible  for all of the sales,
marketing and customer  service  functions for the Green Giant brand,  while the
Company  will handle  vegetable  processing  and canning  operations.  Pillsbury
continues  to own all the  trademark  rights  to the Green  Giant  brand and its
proprietary seed varieties. The assets acquired include certain raw material and
supplies  inventory and six manufacturing  facilities  located in the Midwestern
and Northwestern  United States.  The purchase price of $86.1 million was funded
by a  subordinated  note issued by the Company for $73.0 million and the balance
was funded out of working capital.

In conjunction with this  acquisition,  the Company has entered into a revolving
credit  facility for up to $150.0 million from a syndicate of eleven banks.  The
facility  provides the borrowing  capability  needed for the acquisition and the
Company's existing business. In addition, the Company issued two new senior debt
notes.  The first is a $75.0  million  unsecured  note issued to The  Prudential
Insurance  Company of America,  with  repayment  due  beginning in March 1998, a
final  maturity  date of  February  2005,  and an  interest  rate of 10.78% (see
Long-Term Debt, note 5). The second is a $50.0 million  unsecured note issued to
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance  Company,  with repayment due beginning March
2001, a final  maturity of January  2009,  and an interest  rate of 10.81%.  The
proceeds  of these two notes  were used to  finance  or  replenish  the  working
capital for the following:  1) capital  expenditures of $50.0 million related to
the  Alliance  Agreement  with  Pillsbury;  2)  repayment of two notes due to an
insurance  company,  one  repaid in July 1994 for $13.8  million,  the other for
$26.6  million  which was repaid  when the new debt was  issued;  3) three small
acquisitions  made over the last fifteen months  totaling $15.6 million;  and 4)
the balance,  $19.0 million,  for capital  expenditures made over the last three
years.

During  1994  the  Company  prepaid  an issue of high  interest  long-term  debt
totaling $13.8 million.  This resulted in an extraordinary  loss of $0.6 million
after taxes. Also during 1994 the Company made two small  acquisitions  totaling
$11.7 million.  The debt  prepayment and  acquisitions  were funded from working
capital  and  current  operations.  During  1994 and 1993 the Company had no new
long-term  financing.  During 1992 the Company began  refunding $22.6 million of
tax exempt industrial revenue bonds that was completed in 1993.

As mentioned above,  during 1995 the Company entered into an unsecured revolving
credit agreement for up to $150.0 million.  Previously,  the Company  maintained
uncommitted  lines of credit.  The peak borrowings  reached $54.1 million during
1995. Credit lines provide for interest rate options based on prime, eurodollar,
or money  market.  There were $1.6 million of borrowings  outstanding  under the
lines at the end of 1994 and none for years 1995, 1993 and 1992.

The increase in cash and  short-term  investments of $24.7 million over the four
fiscal year period ended in 1995 was  primarily due to proceeds of the three new
long-term debt issues totaling $198.0 million, proceeds from the disposal of the
textile  segment of $8.4 million,  an income tax refund in 1993 of $4.2 million,
and net earnings.  This was partially  offset by the Green Giant  acquisition of
$86.1  million,  the  debt  prepayments  totaling  $40.4  million;  three  small
acquisitions  totaling  $15.6  million;  the  common  stock  retirement  of $5.1
million;  capital additions of $27.0 million,  $9.4 million,  $1.7 million,  and
$8.7 million in 1995, 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively;  and smaller items not
identified.

The 1995  capital  expenditures  of $27.0  million  largely  reflect part of the
expected  $50.0  million to be spent  related  to the  Alliance  Agreement  with
Pillsbury as mentioned above. During 1994 capital  expenditures were higher than
both 1993 and 1992.  During 1995 the Company began  installation of a green bean
processing line in the Eastern Division,  cold storage facilities in the Central
Division  in the  midwest  and  northwest,  and a  frozen  vegetable  processing
expansion  in the  Central  Division.  During  1994  the  Company  upgraded  its
vegetable  processing  and juice  bottling  equipment  in the Eastern  Division.
During 1992 the Company upgraded a portion of its can manufacturing equipment in
the midwest.

During August 1993 the Company sold its textile division for approximately $8.4
million.  It represented about 6% of the Company's assets and 13% of the 
Company's sales in 1993.

Results of Operations

During 1995,  the Company  changed its fiscal year end to March 31 from July 31.
With the  acquisition  of the Green Giant  plants,  vegetables  now  represent a
substantial  portion of the  Company's  business.  The July year end fell in the
middle of the pack season for certain  vegetable  commodities  while March 31 is
before any packs begin.

The Company's  sales were $234.1  million in the eight month  transition  period
ended 1995.  It is not  appropriate  to annualize  this amount since some of the
commodities sold are only packed annually and certain vegetable inventories were
depleted  well before the new pack. A full year's sales in 1995 would have shown
an increase over 1994.  Sales  increased by 12.7% in 1994 and decreased 8.0% and
0.1% in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

In 1995 vegetable unit sales were sharply higher due to the  industrywide  large
packs. Unit selling prices were down which partially offset the vegetable dollar
sales increases due to volume. The three small acquisitions (one in 1995 and two
in 1994) also contributed to the increase (see  Acquisitions,  note 13). In 1994
vegetable  sales  increased  9.5% due to sharply higher unit selling prices that
resulted from 1993's flooding in the midwest. In 1994 fruit and juice sales were
up 16.7% led by apple juice which was up 9.3%. The two small  acquisitions  also
contributed to the increase (see Acquisitions, note 13). In 1993 vegetable sales
declined  12.4% due to lower unit sales and selling prices while apple and grape
sales declined by 8.4% and 2.1%,  respectively.  This was partially offset by an
increase  in  co-pack  sales.  Vegetable  sales  decreased  due,  in part,  to a
continued oversupply of processed vegetables in the industry.  In 1992 vegetable
sales  increased due to greater unit sales while apple and grape sales declined.
Apple sales in 1992 declined due to the second consecutive year of the worldwide
apple shortage.

In 1995 earnings  decreased  due, in part, to lower selling  prices caused by an
industrywide oversupply of processed vegetables.  In 1994 earnings increased for
the  following  reasons:  1) lower  apple cost of product  sold due to a greater
availability of apples,  2) higher selling prices on vegetables  which more than
offset higher cost of goods sold, 3) the sale of the textile segment and, 4) the
$2.0  million  gain  due  to  implementing  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards (SFAS) 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (see Income Taxes, note 7). In
1993  earnings  increased  for the  following  reasons:  1) lower  apple cost of
product sold due to a greater  availability  of apples,  2) lower  interest cost
since there were lower short-term rates, 3) the refinancing mentioned below and,
4) the $1.7 million of interest  income from the Internal  Revenue  Service (see
Income Taxes, note 7). In 1992 earnings decreased due, in part, to lower selling
prices caused by an industrywide oversupply of processed vegetables. In addition
a  major  shortage  of  processing  apples  in  Europe  and  the  U.  S.  caused
unprecedented  increases  in the  cost of goods  sold  which  resulted  in lower
earnings.  The 1992  earnings  included an  extraordinary  loss of $0.5  million
(after  tax   benefit)   related  to  a   prepayment   penalty  paid  for  early
extinguishment of Industrial Revenue Bonds and accelerated amortization of their
deferred  financing  costs.  Interest savings in the first year more than offset
the costs of refinancing (see Long-Term Debt, note 5).

In general,  inflation played a relatively  small role in the operating  results
and cash  flows of 1995,  1994,  1993 and 1992  since  the  Company  values  its
inventories  on a last-in,  first-out  (LIFO)  basis and  depreciates  its fixed
assets under accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
- --------------------------------------------------

Seneca Foods Corporation and Subsidiaries

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting Period - In 1995, the Company changed its fiscal year end to March 
31.  Fiscal 1995 is an eight-month transition period ended March 31, 1995.

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts for the parent Company and all of its wholly-owned  subsidiaries  after
elimination of intercompany transactions, profits, and balances.

Revenue  Recognition  - Sales and related  cost of product  sold are  recognized
primarily upon shipment of products.

Concentration of Credit Risk - Financial  instruments  that potentially  subject
the Company to credit risk  consist of trade  receivables  and  interest-bearing
investments.  Wholesale  and retail  food  distributors  comprise a  significant
portion  of  the  trade  receivables;  collateral  is  not  required.  The  risk
associated  with  the  concentration  is  limited  due to the  large  number  of
wholesalers and retailers and their geographic dispersion.

The Company  places  substantially  all its  interest-bearing  investments  with
financial institutions and monitors credit exposure.

Cash and  Short-Term  Investments - For purposes of the statement of cash flows,
the Company considers all highly liquid instruments  purchased for a maturity of
three months or less as short-term investments.

Inventories  -  Inventories  are  stated  at lower of cost;  last-in,  first-out
(LIFO); or market.

Income Taxes - The provision for income taxes  includes  federal,  foreign,  and
state income taxes  currently  payable and those  deferred  because of temporary
differences  between  the  financial  statement  and tax  bases  of  assets  and
liabilities.

Depreciation - Property,  plant, and equipment is stated at cost or, in the case
of capital  leases,  the present value of future lease  payments.  For financial
reporting,  the Company provides for depreciation and capital lease amortization
on the  straight-line  method at rates based upon the estimated  useful lives of
the various assets.

Earnings per Common Share - Primary  earnings  per share are  calculated  on the
basis of weighted average common shares  outstanding  since the effect of common
stock  equivalents  is  immaterial.  The  difference  between  primary and fully
diluted earnings per share is also immaterial.


2.  Inventories

The replacement value of the LIFO based inventory was $138,192,000 at March 31,
1995, and $99,647,000 and  $88,864,000 at July 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

3.  Common Stock of Moog Inc.

The  Company's  investment  in the common  stock of Moog Inc. is carried at fair
value in 1995 in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

1992,  and gross  unrealized  holding  gains of  $1,416,000  at March 31,  1995,
$708,000 at July 31, 1994, and $100,000 at July 31, 1993. The Company owns about
7% of the voting  stock of Moog Inc. as of March 31,  1995.  The Company has the
ability and intent to hold these securities for the foreseeable future.


4.  Lines of Credit

The Company obtains required  short-term  funds through bank borrowings.  During
1995 the Company  entered  into an unsecured  revolving  credit  agreement  with
various banks.  At March 31, 1995, the Company had  $3,833,000  outstanding  for
letters  of  credit  and  an  unsecured   revolving  line  of  credit   totaling
$150,000,000.  The line is  renewable  in three years and  provides for loans of
varying maturities at rate options based on Prime, Eurodollar, or Money Market.

Selected details are as follows:

In August, 1992 the Internal Revenue Service completed its audit of fiscal years
1983 and 1984.  This  conclusion  allowed the Company to file a refund claim for
the years 1985 and 1986.  This refund was  received  during the 1993 fiscal year
resulting in a $1,000,000  reduction in the provision for income taxes.  Also in
1993, interest income of $1,680,000 has been netted against the interest expense
category in the Consolidated Statements of Net Earnings.

The  cumulative  effect of the  adoption  of SFAS No.  109 on August 1, 1993 was
$2,006,000.  This change is reported in the 1994 Consolidated  Statements of Net
Earnings.  As permitted under this rule,  prior years financial  statements have
not been restated to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 109.

Earnings  for the fourth  quarter  (third  quarter  in 1995)  have  historically
reflected  adjustments of previously estimated raw material costs and production
levels.  Due to the  dependence on fruit and  vegetable  yields of the Company's
food processing segment,  interim costing must be estimated. The volatile nature
of  inventory  quantities  and costs  within the food  processing  segment  also
necessitates estimates of interim changes to the Company's LIFO reserve.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Board of Directors
   and Stockholders of
Seneca Foods Corporation
Pittsford, New York

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Seneca Foods
Corporation  and  subsidiaries  as of March 31, 1995, July 31, 1994 and July 31,
1993,  and the related  consolidated  statements of net earnings,  stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for the eight months ended March 31, 1995 and for each of
the three years in the period ended July 31, 1994.  These  financial  statements
are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our  responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of Seneca  Foods  Corporation  and
subsidiaries  as of March 31,  1995,  July 31, 1994 and July 31,  1993,  and the
results of their  operations  and their cash  flows for the eight  months  ended
March 31, 1995 and for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 1994
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements,  in fiscal 1994
the Company  changed its method of  accounting  for income taxes to conform with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109.
