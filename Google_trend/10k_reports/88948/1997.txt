                                    Business

                         General Development of Business

SENECA FOODS CORPORATION  (herein referred to as the "Company") was organized in
1949 and  incorporated  under the laws of the State of New  York.  Seneca  Foods
Corporation  purchased six Green  Giant(R)  vegetable  plants from The Pillsbury
Company  effective  February 1, 1995,  resulting in vegetable  products becoming
nearly 80% of  Seneca's  overall  business.  Consequently  during  1995,  Seneca
changed its fiscal year-end from July 31 to March 31 to avoid  overlapping  pack
seasons  between  fiscal  years.  Therefore,  Fiscal  1995  was  an  eight-month
transition period.

                  Financial Information About Industry Segments

The Company's  business  activities are conducted in food and non-food segments.
The food  segment is food  processing.  The  non-food  segment is an air charter
service.  The air charter  service  represents 1% of the Company's  business and
therefore the financial information related to segments is not material.

                        Narrative Description of Business

                         Principal Products and Markets

Food Processing

The principal  products of this segment include grape products,  apple products,
and  vegetables.  The products are canned,  bottled,  and frozen and are sold to
retail and institutional markets. The Company has divided the United States into
four  major   marketing   sections:   Eastern,   Southern,   Northwestern,   and
Southwestern.  Plant  locations  in New  York,  Michigan,  North  Carolina,  and
Washington  provide  ready access to the  domestic  sources of grapes and apples
necessary  to support  marketing  efforts in their  respective  sections  of the
country.  Vegetable operations are primarily supported by plant locations in New
York,  Wisconsin,  Washington,  Idaho, and Minnesota.  In addition,  the Company
operates a mushroom canning facility in Pennsylvania.

The following  summarizes  net sales by major  category for the four years ended
March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 and July 31, 1994:

                     Source and Availability of Raw Material

Food Processing

The Company's food processing plants are located in major vegetable,  grape, and
apple producing  states.  Fruits and vegetables are primarily  obtained  through
contracts with growers.  Apple concentrate is purchased  domestically and abroad
to supplement  raw fruit  purchased  under  contract.  The Company's  sources of
supply are considered  equal or superior to its  competition for all of its food
products.


                                Seasonal Business

Food Processing

While  individual  fruits and vegetables have seasonal cycles of peak production
and sales,  the  different  cycles are usually  offsetting  to some extent.  The
supply of  commodities,  current  pricing,  and expected  new crop  quantity and
quality  affect the timing of the Company's  sales and  earnings.  An Off Season
Allowance  is  established  during the year to  minimize  the effect of seasonal
production on earnings. This is zero at fiscal year-end.


                                     Backlog

Food Processing

In the food  processing  business  the end of year  sales  order  backlog is not
considered  meaningful.   Traditionally,   larger  customers  provide  tentative
bookings for their expected  purchases for the upcoming  season.  These bookings
are further  developed  as data on the  expected  size of the  related  national
harvests  becomes  available.  In general these  bookings  serve as a yardstick,
rather than as a firm commitment,  since actual harvest results can vary notably
from early estimates.  In actual practice,  the Company has substantially all of
its expected  seasonal  production  identified to potential sales outlets before
the seasonal production is completed.


                            Competition and Customers

Food Processing

Competition  in  the  food  business  is  substantial  with  imaginative   brand
registration,  quality service,  and pricing being the major determinants in the
Company's  relative  market  position.  Except  for the  Seneca  apple and grape
products  and Libby's  vegetable  products  data  mentioned  below,  no reliable
statistics are available to establish the exact market position of the Company's
own food  products.  During  the past year  approximately  20% of the  Company's
processed  foods were  packed for retail  customers  under the  Company  branded
labels of Libby's(R),  TreeSweet(R),  and  Seneca(R).  About 7% of the processed
foods were packed for institutional food distributors and 19% of processed foods
were retail packed under the private  label of  customers.  The remaining 54% is
sold under the Alliance  Agreement (see Note 12 of Item 8, Financial  Statements
and  Supplementary  Data).  The customers  represent a full cross section of the
retail, institutional,  distributor, and industrial markets and the Company does
not consider itself  dependent on any single sales source (see Note 1 of Item 8,
Financial  Statements and  Supplementary  Data). In 1996 and 1997, The Pillsbury
Company  represented  our largest  customer as a result of the 20-year  Alliance
Agreement entered into during 1995.

The principal branded products are Seneca Frozen Apple Juice Concentrate,  rated
the number one seller nationally, Seneca Frozen Natural Grape Juice Concentrate,
Seneca  applesauce,  and Libby's canned vegetable  products which rate among the
top five  national  brands.  The  information  under the heading  Liquidity  and
Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and  Results  of  Operations  in the  1997  Annual  Report  is  incorporated  by
reference.
                            Environmental Protection

Environmental  protection is an area that has been worked on most  diligently at
each food processing facility.  In all locations the Company has cooperated with
federal, state, and local environmental protection authorities in developing and
maintaining suitable  antipollution  facilities.  In general,  pollution control
facilities are equal to or somewhat superior to those of our competitors and are
within  environmental  protection  standards.  The  Company  does not expect any
material capital  expenditures to comply with  environmental  regulations in the
near future. The Company is a potentially  responsible party with respect to two
sites but the Company does not believe the aggregate liability is material.

                               Foreign Operations

Export sales for the Company are a relatively  small  portion  (about 5%) of the
food processing sales, excluding the Pillsbury Alliance sales. Approximately 20%
of the Pillsbury Alliance sales are for eventual export.


                                     Item 2

                                   Properties

The Company has nine food  processing,  packaging,  and  warehousing  facilities
located in New York State that provide  approximately  2,365,000  square feet of
food packaging, freezing and freezer storage, and warehouse storage space. These
facilities  process and package fruit and vegetable  products.  The Company is a
lessee under a number of operating  and capital  leases for  equipment  and real
property used for processing and warehousing.

Five other processing,  packaging, and warehousing facilities are located in the
states of North  Carolina  (223,000  square feet),  Pennsylvania  (39,000 square
feet),  and in  Washington  (three  locations  totaling  292,000  square  feet).
Processing  operations in North  Carolina are  primarily  devoted to apple juice
products;  in Washington,  grape juice, apple juice, apple chips, and sauce; and
in Pennsylvania, mushroom canning and warehousing.

Four  facilities  in  Minnesota,  two  facilities  in Michigan,  one facility in
Washington,  one  facility  in  Idaho,  one  facility  in  Kentucky,  and  seven
facilities  in Wisconsin  provide  approximately  5,765,000  square feet of food
packaging,  freezing and freezer  storage,  and warehouse  storage space.  These
facilities  process  and  package  various  vegetable  and fruit  products.  The
facilities are owned by the Company.

The  Company  owns one food  distribution  facility  in  Massachusetts  totaling
approximately  59,000 square feet which is leased out to another company through
2004.  Sublease  income of $577,000  was  received on this  facility  during the
period. In addition the air charter division has a 14,000 square foot facility.

All of the  properties are well  maintained and equipped with modern  machinery.
All locations,  although  highly  utilized,  have the ability to expand as sales
requirements justify. Because of the seasonal production cycles the exact extent
of utilization is difficult to measure. In certain circumstances the theoretical
full efficiency  levels are being reached;  however,  expansion of the number of
production days or hours could increase the output by up to 20% for a season.

Certain of the Company's  facilities are mortgaged to financial  institutions to
secure long-term debt and capital lease  obligations.  See Notes 4 and 5 of Item
8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about
the Company's long-term debt and lease commitments.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Because of the food  processing  segment,  the Company's  yearly  business cycle
shows large  inventory  growth  during the summer and fall harvest  period.  The
inventory  peaks in the early winter and drops to its minimum level  immediately
prior to the next  pack  season.  These  peaks  are  financed  through  seasonal
borrowings whose high and low points essentially  correspond with the changes in
inventory, or by a reduction in short-term investments.  Accordingly,  inventory
management is key to liquidity.

During May 1996 the  Company  sold its  investment  in Moog Inc.  Class A Common
Stock to Moog.  This sale generated cash proceeds of $12.9 million and a pre-tax
gain of $7.5 million.  During August 1996 the Company sold its Clifton Park, New
York facility for cash  resulting in cash proceeds of $4.6 million and a gain of
$1.6 million before income tax expense.  The Company had leased this facility to
a third party.

The sales increase  discussed below reduced the Company's inventory by $71.6 
million as of the 1997 year-end.

During  December 1995 the Company sold its Peabody,  Massachusetts  facility for
cash  resulting in net cash  proceeds of $6.3 million and a gain of $4.3 million
before  income tax  expense.  The Company  had leased  this  facility to a third
party.  In addition,  during  September 1995 the Company entered into a sale and
leaseback  transaction  whereby three of its  wastewater  facilities in New York
State were sold to the Wayne County Water and Sewer  Authority  for net proceeds
of $9.3 million.

During February 1995 the Company acquired certain assets (see Acquisitions, note
12) of the  Green  Giant  Division  of The  Pillsbury  Company  (referred  to as
"Pillsbury"), a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan Incorporated. Under an Alliance
Agreement concurrently executed by the Company, Pillsbury and Grand Metropolitan
Incorporated,  Pillsbury  continues  to be  responsible  for  all of the  sales,
marketing and customer  service  functions for the Green Giant brand,  while the
Company  will handle  vegetable  processing  and canning  operations.  Pillsbury
continues  to own all the  trademark  rights  to the Green  Giant  brand and its
proprietary  seed varieties.  The assets acquired  included certain raw material
and  supplies  inventory  and  six  manufacturing   facilities  located  in  the
Midwestern and Northwestern  United States.  The purchase price of $86.1 million
was funded by a  subordinated  note issued by the Company for $73.0  million and
the balance was funded out of working capital.  This subordinated note decreased
$6.0  million in 1996 as a result of an  agreement  reached  with  Pillsbury  to
convert that amount to the Company's  Class A Common Stock.  Such conversion was
completed in March 1996. The subordinated note increased by $7.6 million in 1997
due to the addition of capital  projects that  Pillsbury has completed and green
bean processing equipment acquired from Pillsbury,  which was transferred to the
Company.

In  conjunction  with this  acquisition,  the Company  entered  into a revolving
credit  facility for up to $150.0  million from a syndicate of eleven banks.  In
addition,  the Company  issued two new senior debt notes.  The first was a $75.0
million  unsecured note issued to The Prudential  Insurance  Company of America,
with  repayment due  beginning in March 1998, a final  maturity date of February
2005,  and an interest rate of 10.78% (see Long-Term  Debt,  note 4). The second
was a $50.0 million  unsecured note issued to John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Company, with repayment due beginning in March 2001, a final maturity of January
2009, and an interest rate of 10.81%.  The proceeds of these two notes were used
to  finance  or  replenish  working  capital  for  the  following:   1)  capital
expenditures of $50.0 million related to the Alliance  Agreement with Pillsbury;
2) repayment of two notes due an insurance company,  one repaid in July 1994 for
$13.8 million,  the other repaid when the new debt was issued for $26.6 million;
3) three small acquisitions made over the previous fifteen months totaling $15.6
million;  and 4) the balance,  $19.0 million, for capital expenditures made over
the previous three years.

During  1994  the  Company  prepaid  an issue of high  interest  long-term  debt
totaling $13.8 million.  This resulted in an extraordinary  loss of $0.6 million
after taxes. Also during 1994 the Company made two small  acquisitions  totaling
$11.7 million.  The debt  prepayment and  acquisitions  were funded from working
capital (see below) and current  operations.  During 1994 the Company had no new
long-term financing.

As mentioned above,  during 1995 the Company entered into an unsecured revolving
credit agreement for up to $150.0 million.  Previously,  the Company  maintained
uncommitted  lines of credit.  Credit lines  provide for  interest  rate options
based on Prime,  Eurodollar,  or Money  Market.  There  were  $18.0  million  of
borrowings  outstanding  under these lines at the end of 1997 and $113.0 million
at the end of 1996.

The decrease in cash and short-term  investments of $13.9 million over the three
and  two-thirds  year  period  ended in 1997 was  primarily  due to Green  Giant
acquisition of $86.1 million, the debt prepayments totaling $40.4 million; three
small acquisitions  totaling $15.6 million;  the common stock retirement of $5.1
million;  capital additions of $11.7 million,  $67.9 million, $27.0 million, and
$9.4 million, in 1997, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively; and smaller items not
identified.  This was partially offset by the proceeds of the four new long-term
debt issues totaling  $207.3 million;  proceeds from the sale of Moog Inc. stock
of $12.9 million,  proceeds from the disposal of two  warehouses  totaling $13.5
million;  proceeds from the disposal of the textile segment of $8.4 million; and
net earnings.

The 1997 capital  expenditures  are down  substantially  from 1996.  The largest
project was the green bean  expansion in  Cumberland,  Wisconsin  related to the
Alliance where $4.4 million was spent in 1997. The 1996 capital  expenditures of
$67.9 million are substantially due to a major capital expansion, which began in
1995, integrating six of Pillsbury's Green Giant vegetable processing plants and
significantly   increasing   the  Company's  own  production   capabilities   to
accommodate  the  production  of four  Pillsbury  plants that were  concurrently
closed. This capital expansion was originally expected to be $50.0 million,  but
to meet the Company's  ambitious goals, an additional $25.0 million was spent on
this  project,  primarily  in the New  York  State  operations  in order to meet
operational  needs of the  Alliance.  The  1995  capital  expenditures  of $27.0
million  largely  reflect  spending  related to the Alliance  with  Pillsbury as
mentioned  above.  During 1995 the Company  began  installation  of a green bean
processing line in the Eastern Division,  cold storage facilities in the Central
Division  in the  Midwest  and  Northwest,  and a  frozen  vegetable  processing
expansion  in the  Central  Division.  During  1994  the  Company  upgraded  its
vegetable processing and juice bottling equipment in the Eastern Division.

During August 1993 the Company sold its textile division for approximately  $8.4
million.  It  represented  about  6% of  the  Company's  assets  and  13% of the
Company's sales in 1993.

Subsequent to the 1997 year-end,  the Company  completed two  acquisitions.  The
first acquisition was Aunt Nellie's Farm Kitchen,  which produces,  markets, and
sells fruit and vegetable products from plants in the Midwest, for approximately
$24.4 million. The fruit product part of the business is in the process of being
sold by the Company. The second acquisition was the Curtice Burns canned branded
and private  label  vegetable  business  for  approximately  $30.9  million (see
Acquisitions, note 12).

Results of Operations

During 1995, the Company  changed its fiscal  year-end to March 31 from July 31.
With the  acquisition  of the Green Giant  plants,  vegetables  now  represent a
substantial  portion of the  Company's  business.  The July year-end fell in the
middle of the pack season for certain  vegetable  commodities  while March 31 is
before the pack season begins.

Net sales for 1997 were $730.1  million,  which includes  $391.7 million sold of
Green Giant vegetables. During 1997 the Company sold for cash, at the request of
an independent  third party,  on a bill and hold basis,  all the remaining Green
Giant vegetables (see Summary of Significant  Accounting Policies,  note 1). Net
sales for 1996 were $508.0  million,  which includes  $168.0 million of sales to
Pillsbury  under the  Alliance.  In 1997  non-Alliance  sales  decreased by $1.6
million.  If 1996 net sales are compared  with the last full year sales  (1994),
the  increase  for the two year  period  is 22.7%  excluding  the  effect of the
Alliance.  The Company's sales were $234.1 million in the eight month transition
period  ended  1995.  It is not  appropriate  to  annualize  this  amount  since
vegetables tend to be sold on a more seasonal basis. A full year's sales in 1995
would have shown an increase  over 1994.  Sales  increased by 12.7% in 1994.  In
1997 vegetable unit sales  increased due to larger packs than the prior year. In
1997 vegetable unit prices  increased for part of the year but declined later in
the year due to excess inventories.  In 1996 vegetable unit sales were lower due
to a less than budget pack. Unit vegetable selling prices dropped in 1996, while
apple pricing rose due to the worldwide  shortage of processing  apples. In 1995
vegetable unit sales were sharply higher due to the  industry-wide  large packs.
Unit selling prices were down which partially  offset the vegetable dollar sales
increases due to volume.  The three small  acquisitions  (one in 1995 and two in
1994) also  contributed  to the increase  (see  Acquisitions,  note 12). In 1994
vegetable  sales  increased  9.5% due to sharply higher unit selling prices that
resulted from 1993's flooding in the Midwest. In 1994 fruit and juice sales were
up 16.7% led by apple juice which was up 9.3%. The two small  acquisitions  also
contributed to the increase (see Acquisitions, note 12).

The 1997 results  include a $7.5  million  pre-tax gain on the sale of Moog Inc.
Class A Common  Stock  back to Moog and a pre-tax  gain on the sale of a Clifton
Park,  New  York  warehouse  of  $1.6  million.   The  1996  results  include  a
non-recurring  charge of $15.1  million,  before  income tax  benefit,  due to a
combination  of start-up  costs  related to the  Pillsbury  Alliance  and severe
drought  conditions in New York State throughout the entire summer.  The Company
undertook an ambitious  capital  expenditure  program  related to the  Pillsbury
Alliance.  In the relatively short time between the February 1995 closing of the
Pillsbury  Alliance and the  beginning of the 1995  vegetable  pack, 37 separate
major  capital  projects  needed to be  completed.  There  were some  unforeseen
problems related to a few of these projects, mostly in the New York plants. Some
of  the  used  equipment  transferred  from  the  closed  plants  had  operating
difficulties  and  were not  always  easily  repaired,  thus  causing  downtime.
Therefore,  plant  throughput  and yields were poor at some plants  resulting in
unfavorable  manufacturing  variances.  The  problems  were  magnified  when the
drought and the hot weather conditions forced the uneven timing of maturities of
vegetables.

In 1997 earnings increased for the following  reasons:  1) the Moog gain of $7.5
million detailed above, 2) higher vegetable selling prices for part of the year,
3) the gain on the  sale of the New  York  warehouse  of $1.6  million  detailed
above,  and 4) greater sales under the Alliance  agreement  produced  additional
earnings.  In 1996 earnings  decreased for the following  reasons:  1) the $15.1
million  non-recurring  charge  detailed  above, 2) higher apple cost of product
sold due to a world-wide  shortage of  processing  apples,  and 3) lower selling
prices on vegetables  due to an ongoing  industry  oversupply.  In 1995 earnings
decreased  due, in part,  to lower  selling  prices  caused by an  industry-wide
oversupply of processed vegetables. In 1994 earnings increased for the following
reasons:  1) lower apple cost of product sold due to a greater  availability  of
apples,  2) higher  selling  prices on vegetables  which more than offset higher
cost of  product  sold,  3) the  sale of the  textile  segment,  and 4) the $2.0
million gain due to  implementing  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
(SFAS) 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (see Income Taxes, note 6).

In 1996, the Company  changed its inventory  valuation  method from the lower of
cost; last-in,  first-out; or market to the lower of cost; first-in,  first-out;
or market.  The major reason for the change is the Alliance  inventories  are on
the  first-in,  first-out  method which  represent the majority of the Company's
inventory  dollars.  The  change  had  been  applied  retroactively  in  1996 by
restating the financial statements of prior years.

In general,  inflation played a relatively  small role in the operating  results
and cash flows of 1997, 1996, 1995 and 1994.

Earnings Per Share - SFAS No. 128

The Company must adopt Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No.
128,  "Earnings  Per Share," in 1998.  Early  adoption of the  Statement  is not
permitted.  The new standard  requires  dual  presentation  of basic and diluted
earnings  per  share  (EPS) on the face of the  Consolidated  Statements  of Net
Earnings and requires a  reconciliation  of the numerators and  denominators  of
basic and diluted  EPS  calculations.  The  Company's  current  EPS  calculation
conforms to basic EPS as defined in the new  Statement.  Diluted EPS will not be
materially different from basic EPS since potential common shares in the form of
convertible  preferred  shares  are not  materially  dilutive  (see  Summary  of
Significant Accounting Policies, note 1).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Seneca Foods Corporation and Subsidiaries

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations - The Company conducts its business almost entirely in food
processing,  operating  32 plants and  warehouses  in nine  states.  The Company
markets  branded and  private  label  processed  foods to retail  customers  and
institutional food distributors.

Accounting  Period - In 1995, the Company  changed its fiscal  year-end to March
31. Fiscal 1995 is an eight-month transition period ended March 31, 1995.

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts for the parent Company and all of its wholly-owned  subsidiaries  after
elimination of intercompany transactions, profits, and balances.

Revenue  Recognition  - Sales and related  cost of product  sold are  recognized
primarily  upon  shipment of  products.  During 1997 and 1996,  the Company sold
$205,633,000 and $167,994,000,  respectively, of canned and frozen vegetables to
Pillsbury  under its  Alliance  Agreement  (see  Acquisitions,  note 12),  which
represented 28% and 33%,  respectively,  of net sales.  During 1997, the Company
sold for cash, at the request of an independent  third party, on a bill and hold
basis,  all of the remaining Green Giant  vegetables.  At the time of the sales,
the aforementioned finished goods inventory was complete, ready for shipment and
segregated  from the Company's other finished goods  inventory.  The Company had
performed all of its  obligations  with respect to the specified  finished goods
inventory sold.  Sales under these agreements were  $186,091,000,  or 26% of net
sales.  Total net sales in 1997 of Green Giant  vegetables were  $391,724,000 or
54% of net sales.

Concentration of Credit Risk - Financial  instruments  that potentially  subject
the Company to credit risk  consist of trade  receivables  and  interest-bearing
investments.   With  the  exception  of  the  aforementioned  relationship  with
Pillsbury, wholesale and retail food distributors comprise a significant portion
of the trade receivables;  collateral is not required.  The risk associated with
the  concentration  is  limited  due to the  large  number  of  wholesalers  and
retailers and their geographic dispersion.  The Company places substantially all
its interest-bearing investments with financial institutions and monitors credit
exposure.

Cash and  Short-Term  Investments  - The  Company  considers  all highly  liquid
instruments  purchased  with a maturity  of three  months or less as  short-term
investments.

Inventories  -  Inventories  are  stated at lower of cost;  first-in,  first-out
(FIFO); or market.

Income Taxes - The provision for income taxes  includes  federal,  foreign,  and
state income taxes  currently  payable and those  deferred  because of temporary
differences  between  the  financial  statement  and tax  bases  of  assets  and
liabilities.

Depreciation - Property,  plant, and equipment is stated at cost or, in the case
of capital  leases,  the present value of future lease  payments.  For financial
reporting,  the Company provides for depreciation and capital lease amortization
on the  straight-line  method at rates based upon the estimated  useful lives of
the various assets.  During 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121,  "Accounting
for  Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to be Disposed
Of". This  Statement  requires  that  impairment  losses be recognized  when the
carrying  value of an  asset  exceeds  its fair  value.  The  Company  regularly
assesses all of its long-lived  assets for  impairment  and  determined  that no
impairment  loss  need  be  recognized  for  applicable   assets  of  continuing
operations.

Earnings per Common Share - Primary  earnings  per share are  calculated  on the
basis of weighted average common shares  outstanding  since the effect of common
stock  equivalents  is  immaterial.  The  difference  between  primary and fully
diluted earnings per share is also immaterial.

In March 1997 the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 128,  "Earnings per Share," which
will be in effect for the Company's  fourth quarter ended March 31, 1998.  Early
adoption of the Statement is not permitted.  The Company's  current earnings per
share  calculation  conforms to basic  earnings  per share as defined in the new
Statement.  Had SFAS No. 128 been effective for the years 1997,  1996, 1995, and
1994,  reported net earnings per share, on an unaudited,  proforma basis,  would
have been as follows:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amount of assets and  liabilities  and the  disclosure of contingent  assets and
liabilities  at the date of the  financial  statements,  as well as the  related
revenues and expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual amounts could differ
from those estimated.

2.  Common Stock of Moog Inc.

The  Company's  investment  in the common  stock of Moog Inc. is carried at fair
value in 1997 and 1996 in accordance with SFAS No. 115,  "Accounting for Certain
Investments  in Debt  and  Equity  Securities".  There  was a  realized  gain of
$7,501,000  before income taxes in 1997.  There were no realized gains or losses
in 1996,  1995,  or 1994 and gross  unrealized  holding  gains of  $695,000  and
$7,832,000, at March 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

3.  Lines of Credit

The Company obtains required  short-term  funds through bank borrowings.  During
1995 the Company  entered  into an unsecured  revolving  credit  agreement  with
various banks.  At March 31, 1997, the Company had  $7,119,000  outstanding  for
letters  of  credit  and  an  unsecured   revolving  line  of  credit   totaling
$150,000,000.  The line is  renewable  in 1998 and provides for loans of varying
maturities at rate options  based on Prime,  Eurodollar,  or Money Market.  This
unsecured revolving line of credit provides for various financial covenants. All
provisions have been meet at March 31, 1997.

As of March 31, 1997 and 1996, the amounts  borrowed under the revolving line of
credit were  $18,000,000 and  $113,000,000,  respectively.  The weighted average
interest rate on the amounts borrowed during these periods were 7.94% and 7.66%,
respectively.

5.  Leases

The Company leases a portion of its equipment and buildings.  Capitalized leases

Company. In the opinion of management any additional tax liability will not have
a material  effect on the  financial  position or results of  operations  of the
Company.

7.  Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock - The outstanding 10% cumulative,  convertible, voting preferred
stock consists of 407,240 Series A shares, convertible at the rate of one common
share of Class A and Class B for every  twenty  preferred  shares,  and  400,000
Series B shares,  which carry a one for thirty conversion rate. The Series A and
B shares have a $.25  stated  value and a $.025 par value.  There are  2,600,000
shares  authorized  of Class A $.025 par value  stock  which  are  unissued  and
undesignated. In addition there are 30,000 shares of no par stock which are also
unissued and undesignated.

Common  Stock -  During  1996  an  amendment  to the  Company's  Certificate  of
Incorporation,  which effected a  recapitalization  of the Company by creating a
second class of common stock (which was  distributed to all common  shareholders
as a stock split in the form of a dividend),  was adopted at the Annual  Meeting
held on August 5, 1995. This  recapitalization  amendment (i)  reclassified  the
existing  Common Stock as Class B Common Stock,  (ii)  authorized a new class of
10,000,000  shares  designated as Class A Common Stock and (iii) established the
express  terms of the Class A Common  Stock and the  Class B Common  Stock.  The
Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock have  substantially  identical
rights  with  respect to any  dividends  or  distributions  of cash or  property
declared on shares of common  stock and rank  equally as to the right to receive
proceeds on  liquidation  or  dissolution  of the Company  after  payment of the
Company's indebtedness and liquidation right to the holders of preferred shares.
However,  holders of Class B Common Stock  retain a full vote per share  whereas
the holders of Class A Common Stock have voting rights of 1/20th of one vote per
share on all matters as to which  shareholders  of the  Company are  entitled to
vote.

In 1996, the Company  reached an agreement with Pillsbury to convert  $6,000,000
of its  subordinated  note into 346,570  shares of the Company's  Class A Common
Stock.

Unissued  shares of common stock reserved for conversion  privileges were 33,695
of Class A and Class B at March 31, 1997 and 1996.

The second quarter of 1996 results include a non-recurring charge of $15,078,000
before  income tax  benefit,  due to  start-up  costs  related to the  Pillsbury
Alliance (see Acquisitions, note 12 and Non-Recurring Charge, note 14).

Earnings  for the fourth  quarter have  historically  reflected  adjustments  of
previously  estimated  raw  material  costs and  production  levels.  Due to the
dependence  on fruit and  vegetable  yields  of the  Company's  food  processing
segment, interim costing must be estimated.

rate of return on plan  assets  was 8.5%.  The Plan holds the  Company's  common
stock with a fair market value of $2,717,000.

The Company has an Employees'  Savings Plan (401(k))  covering all employees who
meet certain age entry  requirements  and work a stated  minimum number of hours
per  year.  Participants  may make  contributions  up to the  legal  limit.  The
Company's matching contributions are discretionary.  Costs charged to operations
for the Company's matching  contributions during 1997 amounted to $211,000 which
represents four months of the year.

10.  Discontinued Operations

In August  1993 the  Company  completed  its sale of the  textile  division  for
$8,400,000 in cash and reported a net gain of $2,273,000 in the first quarter of
1994. As a result of the sale,  textile  operations have been accounted for as a
discontinued operation in the 1994 Consolidated Statement of Net Earnings.

Net sales for the textile  division were  $2,246,000 in 1994.  Total assets were
$8,400,000 and total liabilities were $3,500,000  resulting in $4,900,000 of net

12. Acquisitions

On  February  10, 1995 the Company  acquired  certain  assets of the Green Giant
Division of The Pillsbury Company (referred to as "Pillsbury"),  a subsidiary of
Grand  Metropolitan  Incorporated.  Under  an  Alliance  Agreement  concurrently
executed  by  the  Company,   Pillsbury  and  Grand  Metropolitan  Incorporated,
Pillsbury  continues  to be  responsible  for all of the  sales,  marketing  and
customer  service  functions  for the Green Giant brand,  while the Company will
handle vegetable  processing and canning operations.  Pillsbury continues to own
all the  trademark  rights to the Green  Giant  brand and its  proprietary  seed
varieties.  The assets  acquired  included  certain raw  material  and  supplies
inventory  and  six  manufacturing  facilities  located  in the  Midwestern  and
Northwestern  United  States.  The purchase price was based on the book value of
the assets  acquired.  The purchase price of $86,093,000 was funded by a secured
nonrecourse  subordinated  promissory note issued by the Company for $73,025,000
and the balance was funded out of working capital.

On August 17,  1994 the  Company  acquired  the assets of M.C.  Snack,  Inc.  of
Yakima,  Washington,  a snack food maker of apple chips.  The purchase price was
$3,769,000 which was funded out of working capital.

On December 20, 1993 the Company acquired certain assets of ERLY Juice, Inc. and
WorldMark,  Inc. The assets  acquired  include  certain  trademarks,  inventory,
accounts  receivable,  and  manufacturing  facilities  located  in  Eau  Claire,
Michigan.  Most of the products are sold under the TreeSweet brand. The purchase
price was $8,372,000 which was funded out of working capital.

The Company acquired the Wapato,  Washington juice processing business of Sanofi
Bio-Industries,  Inc. on November 30, 1993.  The purchase  price was  $3,298,000
which was funded out of working capital.

All acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method and,  accordingly,
the operating  results of the acquired  have been  included in the  consolidated
operating results since the dates of acquisition.

Subsequent to March 31, 1997 the Company completed two  acquisitions.  The first
was the acquisition of Aunt Nellie's Farm Kitchen from The Pillsbury  Company, a
subsidiary of Grand  Metropolitan  Incorporated,  for approximately $25 million.
Aunt  Nellie's  Farm Kitchen  produces,  markets,  and sells fruit and vegetable
products from plants in the Midwest and its sales were approximately $50 million
for 1996. The Company purchased the plants,  inventories,  accounts  receivable,
and trademarks of the business.  This  acquisition  was funded  primarily out of
working capital and will be accounted for under the purchase method.

The second  acquisition was the Comstock canned private label vegetable business
from Curtice Burns Foods,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Pro-Fac  Cooperative,
along with the Blue Boy branded canned vegetable business. The Company purchased
two New York plants, related inventories,  and certain trademarks. The companies
also  formed  a  long-term   strategic   alliance,   combining  their  New  York
agricultural departments into one organization. The sales were approximately $40
million in 1996.  The purchase  price was  approximately  $31 million  which was
funded  primarily  out of working  capital and will be  accounted  for under the
purchase method.

13.  Other Income

Other income in 1997  consisted of the  following:  1) a gain on the sale of the
Moog,  Inc.  common  stock of  $7,501,000,  2) a gain on the sale of the Clifton
Park, New York warehouse of $1,640,000, and 3) a loss on the sale of Eau Claire,
Michigan plant of $833,000.

Other  income  in  1996  consisted  of the  gain  on the  sale  of the  Peabody,
Massachusetts warehouse totaling $4,271,000.

14.  Non-Recurring Charge

The 1996 operating results include a non-recurring charge of $15,078,000, before
income tax  benefit,  due to a  combination  of  start-up  costs  related to the
Pillsbury  Alliance and severe drought  conditions in New York State  throughout
the entire  summer.  The Company  undertook  an  ambitious  capital  expenditure
program related to the Pillsbury Alliance.  In the relatively short time between
the February  1995 closing of the  Pillsbury  Alliance and the  beginning of the
1995 vegetable pack, 37 separate major capital  projects needed to be completed.
There were some unforeseen  problems related to a few of these projects,  mostly
in the New York plants.  Some of the used equipment  transferred from the closed
plants had  operating  difficulties  and were not always easily  repaired,  thus
causing  downtime.  Throughput and yields were poor at some plants  resulting in
unfavorable  manufacturing  variances.  The  problems  were  magnified  when the
drought and the hot weather conditions forced the uneven timing of maturities of
vegetables.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Seneca Foods Corporation
Pittsford, New York

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Seneca Foods
Corporation  and  subsidiaries  as of March 31,  1997 and 1996,  and the related
consolidated  statements of net earnings,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows
for the years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996,  for the eight  months  ended March
31, 1995 and for the year ended July 31, 1994.  These  financial  statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of Seneca  Foods  Corporation  and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for the years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996,  for the eight
months  ended March 31, 1995 and for the year ended July 31, 1994 in  conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in note 6 the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal 1994 the
Company  changed  its  method of  accounting  for income  taxes to conform  with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109.
