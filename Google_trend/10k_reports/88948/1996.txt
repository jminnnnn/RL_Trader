                                  Business

                     General Development of Business

SENECA FOODS CORPORATION  (herein referred to as the "Company") was organized in
1949 and  incorporated  under the laws of the State of New  York.  Seneca  Foods
Corporation  purchased six Green  Giant(R)  vegetable  plants from The Pillsbury
Company  effective  February 1, 1995,  resulting in vegetable  products becoming
nearly 80% of Seneca's overall  business.  Consequently,  Seneca has changed its
fiscal  year-end  from  July 31 to March 31 to avoid  overlapping  pack  seasons
between  fiscal  years.  Therefore,  Fiscal 1995 was an  eight-month  transition
period.

              Financial Information About Industry Segments

The Company's  business  activities are conducted in food and non-food segments.
The food  segment is food  processing.  The  non-food  segment is an air charter
service.  The air charter  service  represents 1% of the Company's  business and
therefore the financial information related to segments is not material.

                     Narrative Description of Business

                       Principal Products and Markets

Food Processing

The principal  products of this segment include grape products,  apple products,
and  vegetables.  The products are canned,  bottled,  and frozen and are sold to
retail and institutional markets. The Company has divided the United States into
four  major   marketing   sections:   Eastern,   Southern,   Northwestern,   and
Southwestern.  Plant  locations  in New  York,  Michigan,  North  Carolina,  and
Washington  provide  ready access to the  domestic  sources of grapes and apples
necessary  to support  marketing  efforts in their  respective  sections  of the
country.  Vegetable operations are primarily supported by plant locations in New
York,  Wisconsin,  Washington,  Idaho, and Minnesota.  In addition,  the Company
operates a mushroom canning facility in Pennsylvania.

The following  summarizes  net sales by major  category for the four years ended
March 31, 1996 and 1995 and July 31, 1994 and 1993:

                   Source and Availability of Raw Material

Food Processing

The Company's food processing plants are located in major vegetable,  grape, and
apple producing  states.  Fruits and vegetables are primarily  obtained  through
contracts with growers.  Apple concentrate is purchased  domestically and abroad
to supplement  raw fruit  purchased  under  contract.  The Company's  sources of
supply are considered  equal or superior to its  competition for all of its food
products.


                            Seasonal Business

Food Processing

While  individual  fruits and vegetables have seasonal cycles of peak production
and sales,  the  different  cycles are usually  offsetting  to some extent.  The
supply of  commodities,  current  pricing,  and expected  new crop  quantity and
quality  affect the timing of the Company's  sales and  earnings.  An Off Season
Allowance  is  established  during the year to  minimize  the effect of seasonal
production on earnings. This is zero at fiscal year-end.


                                 Backlog

Food Processing

In the food  processing  business  the end of year  sales  order  backlog is not
considered  meaningful.   Traditionally,   larger  customers  provide  tentative
bookings for their expected  purchases for the upcoming  season.  These bookings
are further  developed  as data on the  expected  size of the  related  national
harvests  becomes  available.  In general these  bookings  serve as a yardstick,
rather than as a firm commitment,  since actual harvest results can vary notably
from early estimates.  In actual practice,  the Company has substantially all of
its expected  seasonal  production  identified to potential sales outlets before
the seasonal production is completed.


                         Competition and Customers

Food Processing

Competition  in  the  food  business  is  substantial  with  imaginative   brand
registration,  quality service,  and pricing being the major determinants in the
Company's  relative  market  position.  Except  for the  Seneca  apple and grape
products  and Libby's  vegetable  products  data  mentioned  below,  no reliable
statistics are available to establish the exact market position of the Company's
own food  products.  During  the past year  approximately  26% of the  Company's
processed  foods were  packed for retail  customers  under the  Company  branded
labels of Libby's(R),  Nature's Favorite(R),  TreeSweet(R), and Seneca(R). About
10% of the processed foods were packed for  institutional  food distributors and
31% of processed  foods were retail packed under the private label of customers.
The remaining 33% is sold to Pillsbury under the Alliance Agreement (see Note 12
of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The customers represent
a full cross section of the retail,  institutional,  distributor, and industrial
markets and the Company does not consider  itself  dependent on any single sales
source. In 1996 and in the future,  The Pillsbury Company represents our largest
customer as a result of the 20-year Alliance Agreement entered into during 1995.

The principal branded products are Seneca Frozen Apple Juice Concentrate,  rated
the number one seller nationally, Seneca Frozen Natural Grape Juice Concentrate,
Seneca  applesauce,  and Libby's canned vegetable  products which rate among the
top five  national  brands.  The  information  under the heading  Liquidity  and
Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and  Results  of  Operations  in the  1996  Annual  Report  is  incorporated  by
reference.


<PAGE>


                         Environmental Protection

Environmental  protection is an area that has been worked on most  diligently at
each food processing facility.  In all locations the Company has cooperated with
federal, state, and local environmental protection authorities in developing and
maintaining suitable  antipollution  facilities.  In general,  pollution control
facilities are equal to or somewhat superior to those of our competitors and are
within  environmental  protection  standards.  The  Company  does not expect any
material capital  expenditures to comply with  environmental  regulations in the
near future. The Company is a potentially  responsible party with respect to two
sites but the Company does not believe the aggregate liability is material.

                              Foreign Operations

Export sales for the Company are a relatively  small  portion  (about 5%) of the
food processing sales, excluding the Pillsbury Alliance sales. Approximately 20%
of the Pillsbury Alliance sales are for eventual export.


                                    Item 2

                                  Properties

The Company has nine food  processing,  packaging,  and  warehousing  facilities
located in New York State that provide  approximately  1,819,000  square feet of
food packaging, freezing and freezer storage, and warehouse storage space. These
facilities  process and package fruit and vegetable  products.  The Company is a
lessee under a number of operating  and capital  leases for  equipment  and real
property used for processing and warehousing.

Five other processing,  packaging, and warehousing facilities are located in the
states of North  Carolina  (223,000  square feet),  Pennsylvania  (39,000 square
feet),  and in  Washington  (three  locations  totaling  292,000  square  feet).
Processing  operations in North  Carolina are  primarily  devoted to apple juice
products;  in Washington,  grape juice, apple juice, apple chips, and sauce; and
in Pennsylvania, mushroom canning and warehousing.

Four  facilities  in  Minnesota,  one  facility  in  Michigan,  one  facility in
Washington,  one facility in Idaho,  and seven  facilities in Wisconsin  provide
approximately  4,456,000  square feet of food  packaging,  freezing  and freezer
storage,  and warehouse  storage  space.  These  facilities  process and package
various vegetable and fruit products. The facilities are owned by the Company.

The Company owns two food distribution  facilities in Massachusetts and New York
totaling  approximately  206,000  square  feet  which  are  leased  out to other
companies  through  1996 and 2004.  The Company has entered into an agreement to
sell the New York property in August 1996.  Sublease  income of  $1,849,000  was
received  on these  facilities  during the period.  In addition  the air charter
division has a 14,000 square foot facility.

All of the  properties are well  maintained and equipped with modern  machinery.
All locations,  although  highly  utilized,  have the ability to expand as sales
requirements justify. Because of the seasonal production cycles the exact extent
of utilization is difficult to measure. In certain circumstances the theoretical
full efficiency  levels are being reached;  however,  expansion of the number of
production days or hours could increase the output by up to 20% for a season.

Certain of the Company's  facilities are mortgaged to financial  institutions to
secure long-term debt and capital lease  obligations.  See Notes 4 and 5 of Item
8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about
the Company's lease commitments.

Dear Sirs/ Madames:

We  have  audited  the  consolidated   financial   statements  of  Seneca  Foods
Corporation and  subsidiaries as of March 31, 1996,  March 31, 1995 and July 31,
1994,  and for the year ended March 31,  1996,  the eight months ended March 31,
1995 and for each of the two years in the period ended July 31,  1994,  included
in your Annual Report on Form 10-K to the Securities and Exchange Commission and
have issued our report thereon dated May 31, 1996.  Note 1 to such  consolidated
financial  statements  contains a description  of your adoption  during the year
ended March 31, 1996 of the first-in,  first-out (FIFO) method of accounting for
inventories,  whereas you previously used the last-in,  first-out (LIFO) method.
In our judgment,  such change is to an alternative  accounting principle that is
preferable under the circumstances.

================================================================================




         We, the undersigned,  being the President and Secretary of SENECA FOODS
CORPORATION, do hereby certify as follows:

FIRST: The name of the Corporation is SENECA FOODS  CORPORATION.  The name under
     which the Corporation was formed is SENECA GRAPE JUICE CORPORATION.

SECOND: The  certificate of  incorporation  of the  Corporation was filed by the
     Department of State on August 17, 1949.

THIRD: The certificate of incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended to:
(a)  Authorize a new class of ten million (10,000,000) shares of Common Stock of
     the par value of $0.25 to be designated Class A Common Stock;
(b)  Reclassify the existing class of Common Stock as Class B Common Stock;
(c)  Establish  the  express  terms of the Class A Common  Stock and the Class B
     Common Stock.
         To  accomplish   this,   Articles  3  and  4  of  the   Certificate  of
Incorporation, are hereby amended to read in their entirety as follows:
                  3. The Capital Stock of the  Corporation  shall consist of ten
         million (10,000,000) shares of Class A Common Stock of the par value of
         $0.25 each; ten million  (10,000,000) shares of Class B Common Stock of
         the par value of $0.25 each; two hundred  thousand  (200,000) shares of
         Six Percent (6%) Voting Cumulative  Preferred Stock of the par value of
         $0.25 each;  thirty thousand (30,000) shares of Preferred Stock Without
         Par Value,  to be issued in series by the Board of Directors,  pursuant
         to the  provisions  of Article 4,  Section (c)  hereof,  subject to the
         limitations  prescribed by law; and four million  (4,000,000) shares of
         Preferred  Stock  with  $.025 par  value,  Class A, to be issued by the
         Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article 4, Section (d)
         hereof,  subject  to the  limitations  prescribed  by law.  The  stated
         capital of the Corporation as determined pursuant to Section 506 of the
         Business  Corporation Law shall be increased by six hundred ninety nine
         thousand one hundred  thirty nine dollars  ($699,139) and such increase
         shall be  allocated  equally  to the  stated  capital in respect of the
         Corporation's  $0.25 par value Class A Common  Stock and Class B Common
         Stock.

                  4. The designations, preferences, privileges and voting powers
         of the  shares  of  each  class  of  stock  which  the  Corporation  is
         authorized to issue,  and the restrictions or  qualifications  thereof,
         shall be as follows:

                  (a)      Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

(A)  Provisions Applicable to Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

                           (i) The holders of record of Class A Common Stock and
         the holders of record of Class B Common  Stock shall have equal  rights
         and  rank  per  share  with  respect  to  any  and  all  dividends  and
         distributions  declared on the common stock of the Corporation,  and no
         dividend or  distribution  shall be  declared  or made with  respect to
         either  Class A  Common  Stock  or Class B  Common  Stock  unless  that
         dividend or distribution is declared and made with respect to both such
         classes;  except that  (subject to  conversion  rights of any preferred
         stocks) a dividend or distribution upon Class A Common Stock which will
         be paid in shares of common stock of the Corporation  shall be declared
         and made  only in  shares of Class A Common  Stock  and a  dividend  or
         distribution  upon Class B Common Stock which will be paid in shares of
         common  stock of the  Corporation  shall be  declared  and made only in
         shares of Class B Common Stock, and if a dividend or distribution is so
         declared  and paid in shares of one class of common stock to the holder
         of each share of that class, a per-share dividend or distribution in an
         equal  number of shares of the  other  class of common  stock  shall be
         concurrently  declared  and paid to the  holder  of each  share of such
         other class,  so that the number of shares of Class A Common Stock paid
         as a dividend or  distribution on a share of Class A Common Stock shall
         be equal to the  number  of shares  of Class B Common  Stock  paid as a
         dividend or distribution on a share of Class B Common Stock.

                           (ii) In the  event of any  voluntary  or  involuntary
         liquidation,  dissolution  or any winding up of the  Corporation,  each
         share of Class A Common  Stock  and  Class B Common  Stock  shall  rank
         equally with respect to any  distribution  to be received by holders of
         common  stock  upon or with  respect  to  liquidation,  dissolution  or
         winding up.

         (B)      Provisions Applicable to Class A Common Stock.

                           (i) The holders of Class A Common  Stock are entitled
         to  one-twentieth  (1/20th)  of one  vote per  share  on all  questions
         presented  to the  stockholders.  In all  elections of directors of the
         Corporation,  each holder of Class A Common  Stock shall have the right
         to vote in person or by proxy  one-twentieth  (1/20th)  of one vote for
         each  share of Class A Common  Stock  held by such  holder  for as many
         Persons as there are directors to be elected.  No cumulative voting for
         directors shall be permitted.

          Any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws
         of the  Corporation  requiring  the  affirmative  vote  of a  specified
         percentage of shares of the Corporation shall be read to give effect to
         the lesser  voting  rights of the  holders  of Class A Common  Stock as
         described above; specifically, a provision that the affirmative vote of
         a specified  percentage  of the shares of the  Corporation  is required
         shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of that percentage of
         the aggregate voting power of the Corporation.

                         The holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to
         vote as a separate class (i) on any proposal to amend the Corporation's
         Certificate  of  Incorporation  to increase  the  authorized  number of
         shares of Class B Common Stock, unless the increased authorization does
         not exceed the number of shares of Class B Common  Stock  which must be
         issued in a proposed  stock  dividend with respect to shares of Class B
         Common Stock and which conforms to the  requirements  set forth in this
         Article  with  respect  to  payment  of  dividends  in  stock  of  this
         Corporation  upon  shares  of Class B Common  Stock  and Class A Common
         Stock and (ii) as required by applicable law.

                           (ii) The Class A Common Stock is not convertible into
         shares of Class B Common Stock, unless the number of outstanding shares
         of Class B Common  Stock  falls  below 5% of the  aggregate  number  of
         outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock. At
         such  time,  all of the  outstanding  Class  A  Common  Stock  will  be
         converted  automatically  into  shares  of  Class B  Common  Stock on a
         share-for-share  basis.  For  purposes  of  this  Article  4(a)(B)(ii),
         "outstanding"  shares of Common Stock would not include shares of Class
         B Common  Stock or shares of Class A Common  Stock  repurchased  by the
         Corporation and not reissued.

         (C)      Provisions Applicable to Class B Common Stock.

                           (i) Except as provided in  paragraph  (C)(ii) of this
         Article  4(a),  the holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to one
         vote per share on all questions  presented to the stockholders.  In all
         elections  of  directors  of the  Corporation,  each  holder of Class B
         Common  Stock  shall  have the  right to vote in person or by proxy the
         number of shares of Class B Common  Stock  held by such  holder  for as
         many Persons as there are directors to be elected. No cumulative voting
         for directors  shall be permitted.  The holders of Class B Common Stock
         are entitled to vote as a separate  class where  required by applicable
         law.  If any  share of Class B Common  Stock is  ineligible  to vote by
         reason  of the  limitations  contained  in  paragraph  (c)(ii)  of this
         Article 4(a), that share will be excluded from the determination of the
         total  shares  eligible  to vote for any  purpose  for  which a vote of
         shareholders is taken.

                           (ii) The voting  rights of holders of shares of Class
         B Common Stock are subject to the following  restrictions:  If a Person
         acquires more than 15% (the "15% Threshold  Amount") of the outstanding
         Class B Common  Stock after August 5, 1995 (the  "Threshold  Date") and
         does not acquire after the  Threshold  Date a percentage of the Class A
         Common Stock  outstanding  at least equal to the  percentage of Class B
         Common Stock acquired by that Person after the Threshold Date in excess
         of the 15%  Threshold  Amount,  such Person will not be allowed to vote
         shares of Class B Common Stock  acquired  after the  Threshold  Date in
         excess of the 15% Threshold Amount. The inability of the Person to vote
         the  shares  of Class B Common  Stock in  excess  of the 15%  Threshold
         Amount will continue  until such time as a sufficient  number of shares
         of Class A Common Stock have been acquired by the Person.

                                   For purposes of calculating the 15% Threshold
         Amount, the following acquisitions and increases shall be excluded: (i)
         shares of Class B Common  Stock  held by any  Person  on the  Threshold
         Date,  (ii) an increase in a holder's  percentage  ownership of Class B
         Common  Stock  resulting  solely  from a change in the total  number of
         shares of Class B Common Stock  outstanding as a result of a repurchase
         of Class B Common Stock by the Corporation since the last date on which
         that holder acquired Class B Common Stock,  (iii) acquisitions of Class
         B Common  Stock (1) made  pursuant to contracts  existing  prior to the
         Threshold  Date,  including  the  acquisition  of Class B Common  Stock
         pursuant  to the  conversion  provisions  of  Class A  Preferred  Stock
         outstanding prior to the Threshold Date, (2) by bequest or inheritance,
         or by operation of law upon the death or incompetency of any individual
         and (3) by any other transfer made without valuable  consideration,  in
         good faith and not for the purpose of  circumventing  the  restrictions
         imposed by the 15% Threshold  Amount.  A gift made to any Person who is
         related to the donor by blood or marriage,  a gift made to a charitable
         organization  qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
         Code of 1986 or a successor  provision  and a gift to a Person who is a
         fiduciary solely for the benefit of, or which is owned entirely by, one
         or more of the following persons or entities:
          (1)      a person who is related to the donor by blood or marriage, or

          (2)      a charitable organization which is qualified under Section
                   501(c)(3) as described above

         shall be  presumed  to be made in good  faith and not for  purposes  of
         circumventing the restrictions imposed by the 15% Threshold Amount.

                                   Acquisitions of Class A Common Stock so as to
         preclude  the  effect  of  the  voting  restrictions  contained  in the
         preceding paragraph must be made for an "equitable price." For purposes
         of this paragraph an "equitable price" is deemed to have been paid only
         when the shares of Class A Common  Stock have been  acquired at a price
         at least  equal to the  greater of (i) the highest per share price paid
         by the acquiring  Person,  in cash or non-cash  consideration,  for any
         Class B Common Stock acquired  within the 60-day periods  preceding and
         following  the  acquisition  of the  Class A  Common  Stock or (ii) the
         highest  closing  market sale price of Class B Common  Stock during the
         30-day periods  preceding and following the  acquisition of the Class A
         Common  Stock.  The  value  of  any  non-cash   consideration  will  be
         determined by the Board of Directors  acting in good faith. The highest
         closing  market  sale price of a share of Class B Common  Stock will be
         the highest closing sale price reported by the principal trading market
         for either class of Common Stock.

         As used in this Article 4(a)(C)(ii):

                                            "Person" shall include one or more
                  persons and  entities  who act or agree to act in concert with
                  respect to the  acquisition  or  disposition of Class B Common
                  Stock or with  respect to  proposing  or  effecting  a plan or
                  proposal to (a) a merger, reorganization or liquidation of the
                  Corporation or a sale of a material amount of its assets,  (b)
                  a  change  in  the   Corporation's   Board  of   Directors  or
                  management,  including any plans or proposal to fill vacancies
                  on the  Board of  Directors  or change  the  number or term of
                  Directors,  (c) a material change in the business or corporate
                  structure of the  Corporation,  or (d) any material  change in
                  the  capitalization or dividend policy of the Corporation.  As
                  used  in the  preceding  sentence,  "act  or  agree  to act in
                  concert"  shall  not  include  acts  or  agreements  to act by
                  persons pursuant to their official  capacities as Directors or

                  blood or marriage.

                                            Each reference to acquiring or
                  acquisition  of Class B Common  Stock and Class A Common Stock
                  shall include direct and indirect acquisitions of such stock.

                           (iii) The holders of Class B Common  Stock shall have
         the right, at their option, to convert such shares into shares of Class
         A  Common  Stock  at  any  time  after  the  issuance  thereof,   on  a
         share-per-share  basis. The conversion rights in the preceding sentence
         shall expire upon the  occurrence  of the  automatic  conversion of all
         outstanding  shares of Class A Common  Stock into Class B Common  Stock
         pursuant to the  provisions of paragraph  (B)(ii) of this Article 4(a).
         In order to convert shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class

         the  Corporation  or in blank,  and give written  notice at such office
         that he elects to convert  such  shares of Class B Common  Stock  which

         called the "Class A Conversion  Date") of the  surrender of such shares
         for conversion as provided above, and the person or persons entitled to
         receive  the  shares  of  Class  A  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  such
         conversion  shall be treated for all  purposes as the record  holder or
         holders  of  such  Class  A  Common  Stock  on  such  date.  As soon as
         practicable on or after the Class A Conversion  Date,  the  Corporation
         will  deliver at such  office a  certificate  or  certificates  for the
         number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on such conversion.

                  (b)      Six Percent (6%) Voting Cumulative Preferred Stock.

                           (A) The holders of record of Six Percent  (6%) Voting
         Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cash dividends when and
         as declared by the Board of  Directors  at the rate of six percent (6%)
         of the par value per share per annum and no more,  payable on the first
         days of January and July in each year in  preference to and in priority
         over dividends upon the common stock and all other shares junior to the
         Six Percent (6%) Voting Cumulative Preferred Stock. Such cash dividends
         on the Six Percent  (6%) Voting  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock are to be
         cumulative so that, if for any year or years cash dividends at the rate
         of six percent  (6%) per share per annum are not  declared  and paid or
         set  apart for  payment  on such Six  Percent  (6%)  Voting  Cumulative
         Preferred Stock outstanding,  the deficiency shall be declared and paid
         or set apart for payment  prior to the making of any  dividend or other
         distribution  on the  common  stock,  such  cash  dividends  on the Six
         Percent (6%) Voting Cumulative  Preferred Stock to accrue from the date
         of issue if that be a dividend  date,  otherwise from the dividend date
         next  preceding  the  date of issue of such  Six  Percent  (6%)  Voting
         Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  Upon the  payment or  setting  apart for
         payment of all  dividends  current and  accumulated  at the rate of six
         percent  (6%) per annum upon the Six  Percent  (6%)  Voting  Cumulative
         Preferred  Stock,  the directors may declare and pay dividends in order
         of  priority  upon shares  junior to the said Six  Percent  (6%) Voting
         Cumulative Preferred Stock.

                           (B) In the  event  of any  voluntary  or  involuntary
         liquidation,  dissolution  or any  winding up of the  Corporation,  the
         holders of record of the Six Percent (6%) Voting  Cumulative  Preferred
         Stock  shall be entitled to be paid the full par value of such issue of
         Preferred Stock plus accumulated  dividends thereon to the date of such
         liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,  whether or
         not the  Corporation  shall have a surplus or  earnings  available  for
         dividends,  and no more before any  distribution of any assets shall be
         made to the holders of any class of common stock or other shares junior
         to the Six Percent (6%) Voting Cumulative Preferred Stock.

                           (C) The  Corporation  at its  option  may  redeem the
         whole or any part,  pro rata or by lot, of the Six Percent  (6%) Voting
         Cumulative  Preferred Stock  outstanding at any time by paying therefor
         in cash one  hundred  percent  (100%)  of the par  value  thereof  plus
         accumulated  dividends thereon to the date fixed for such redemption by
         mailing  notice of such  redemption  to the holders of such Six Percent
         (6%)  Voting  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  to  be  redeemed  at  their
         respective addresses as such addresses may appear on the stock books of
         the  Corporation,  specifying  the time and place of  redemption at the
         office of the  Corporation,  such  notice to be mailed at least  thirty
         (30) days and not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date specified
         therein for redemption.

                           (D) In all elections of directors of the Corporation,
         each holder of Six Percent (6%) Voting Cumulative Preferred Stock shall
         have the right to vote in  person  or by proxy the  number of shares of
         Six Percent (6%) Voting  Cumulative  Preferred Stock held by him for as
         many Persons as there are directors to be elected. No cumulative voting
         for directors shall be permitted.

                           (E) A class of stock shall be deemed to be "junior to
         the Six Percent  (6%)  Voting  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock" if the Six
         Percent (6%) Voting  Cumulative  Preferred Stock has priority over such
         class with
         respect to dividend rights or liquidation rights.

                  (c)      Preferred Stock Without Par Value.

                           (A) The Board of Directors is authorized,  subject to
         limitations prescribed by law and the provisions of this paragraph,  to
         provide  for the  issuance in series of the shares of  Preferred  Stock
         Without Par Value, and by filing a certificate pursuant to the Business
         Corporation  Law, to  establish  the number of shares to be included in
         each  such  series,  and  to  fix  the  designation,  relative  rights,
         preferences  and  limitations of the shares of each such series whether
         or not such relative rights, preferences and limitations of such series
         shall  be  fixed as  senior  to,  junior  to,  or on a parity  with the
         relative  rights,  preferences  and  limitations  of any other class of
         stock or series  thereof,  and to reclassify or alter the  designation,
         relative  rights,  preferences  and  limitations  of any authorized and
         unissued  Preferred  Stock Without Par Value whether or not such shares
         shall  have been  designated  as shares of any  particular  series  and
         whether or not such relative  rights,  preferences  and  limitations of
         such series shall be fixed as senior to, junior to, or on a parity with
         the relative rights,  preferences and limitations of any other class of
         stock or series  thereof.  The  authority  of the Board with respect to
         each series shall include,  but not be limited to, determination of the
         following:

                              (i)  The number of shares constituting that series
         and the distinctive designation of that series;

                              (ii)  The rate and times at which, and the terms
         and  conditions on which,  dividends,  if any, on shares of such series
         shall be paid,  the extent of the  preference  or relation,  if any, of
         such  dividends to the dividends  payable on any other class or classes
         or  series  of the same or other  classes  of stock  and  whether  such
         dividends shall be cumulative or non-cumulative;

                             (iii) Whether  that  series  shall have  voting 
          rights,  in addition to any voting  rights  provided by law,  and, if
          so, the terms of such voting rights;
                             (iv)  Whether that series shall have conversion
         privileges,  and, if so, the terms and  conditions of such  conversion,
         including  provision  for  adjustment  of the  conversion  rate in such
         events as the Board of Directors shall determine;

                             (v)  Whether or not the shares of that series shall
         be redeemable, and, if so, the terms and conditions of such redemption,
         including  the  date or  dates  upon  or  after  which  they  shall  be
         redeemable,  and the  amount per share  payable in case of  redemption,
         which  amount  may vary under  different  conditions  and at  different
         redemption dates;

                            (vi)  The rights of the shares of that series in the
         event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, merger, consolidation,
         distribution or sale of assets, dissolution or winding up of the 
         Corporation; and

                              (vii)  Any other relative rights, preferences and
         limitations of that series.

                           The authority of the Board of Directors  with respect
         to each such series shall be limited by the condition that no series of
         the shares of any series so  authorized by the Board of Directors to be
         issued  shall  rank  as to  the  payment  of  dividends  or  rights  on
         liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation senior to the
         shares of any  previously  authorized  series or of any other  class of
         Preferred  Stock  without  an  affirmative  vote of a  majority  of the
         holders of each such series or class of stock.

                           (B)  Dividends  on  outstanding  shares of  Preferred
         Stock  Without Par Value shall be declared  and paid,  or set apart for
         payment,  before any dividends shall be declared and paid, or set apart
         for  payment,  on any class of common  stock  with  respect to the same
         dividend period. If the stated dividends on the shares of all series of
         Preferred  Stock Without Par Value are not paid in full,  the shares of
         all  series  of such  class  shall  share  ratably  in the  payment  of
         dividends including  accumulation,  if any, in accordance with the sums
         which would be payable on such shares if all  dividends  were  declared
         and paid in full.

                           (C) In the  event  of any  voluntary  or  involuntary
         liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders
         of shares of each  series of  Preferred  Stock  Without  Par Value then
         outstanding  shall be  entitled  to  receive  out of the  assets of the
         Corporation,  before any  distribution  or payment shall be made to the
         holders  of any class of common  stock,  an amount  equal to the stated
         value of the stock plus, in respect of each share with respect to which
         dividends are cumulative,  a sum computed at the dividend rate provided
         for in the  Certificate  of  Incorporation  from and  after the date on
         which  dividends on such shares became  cumulative to and including the
         date  fixed  for such  payment,  less the  aggregate  of the  dividends
         theretofore paid thereon, but computed without interest. If the amounts
         payable  on  liquidation  in  respect  to the  shares of all  series of
         Preferred  Stock Without Par Value are not paid in full,  the shares of
         all series of such class shall  share  ratably in any  distribution  of
         assets other than by way of dividends in accordance with the sums which
         would  be  payable  in  such  distribution  if all  sums  payable  were
         discharged in full. If such payment shall have been made in full to the
         holders of all shares of Preferred Stock Without Par Value on voluntary
         or  involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution or winding up, the remaining
         assets of the  Corporation  shall be  distributed  in  accordance  with
         Section (d)(C) of this Article 4. For the purpose of this paragraph,  a
         consolidation  or  merger  of the  Corporation  with one or more  other
         corporations  shall not be deemed to be a liquidation  or winding up of
         the Corporation.

                  (d)  Preferred Stock With $.025 Par Value, Class A.

                           (A) The Board of Directors is authorized,  subject to
         the limitations prescribed by law and the provisions of this paragraph,
         to provide for the issuance in series of the shares of Preferred  Stock
         With $.025 Par Value,  Class A  (hereinafter  called "Class A Preferred
         Stock"),   and  by  filing  a  certificate  pursuant  to  the  Business
         Corporation  Law, to  establish  the number of shares to be included in
         each  such  series,  and  to  fix  the  designation,  relative  rights,
         preferences  and  limitations  of the shares of each such  series.  The
         authority of the Board with respect to each series shall  include,  but
         not be limited to, determination of the following:

                            (i) The number of shares constituting that series
         and the distinctive designation of that series;

                            (ii)  The rate and times at which, and the terms
         and  conditions on which,  dividends,  if any, on shares of such series
         shall be paid,  the extent of the  preference  or relation,  if any, of
         such  dividends to the dividends  payable on any other class or classes
         or  series  of the same or other  classes  of stock  and  whether  such
         dividends shall be cumulative or non-cumulative;

                            (iii)  Whether that series shall have voting
         rights, in addition to any voting rights provided by law, and, if so, 
         the terms of such voting rights;

                            (iv)  Whether that series shall have conversion
         privileges,  and, it so, the terms and  conditions of such  conversion,
         including  provision  for  adjustment  of the  conversion  rate in such
         events as the Board of Directors shall determine;

                             (v)  Whether or not the shares of that series shall
         be redeemable, and, if so, the terms and conditions of such redemption,
         including  the  date or  dates  upon  or  after  which  they  shall  be
         redeemable,  and the  amount per share  payable in case of  redemption,
         which  amount  may vary under  different  conditions  and at  different
         redemption dates;

                              (vi)  The rights of the shares of that series in
         the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, merger, 
         consolidation, distribution or sale of assets, dissolution or winding
         up of the Corporation; and

                               (vii)  Any other relative rights, preferences and
         limitations of that series.

                  The  authority of the Board of  Directors  shall be limited by
         the condition that the shares of each series of Class A Preferred Stock
         authorized by the Board of Directors to be issued shall rank, as to the
         payment of dividends or rights on  liquidation,  dissolution or winding
         up of the Corporation,  junior to the shares of any authorized class of
         Preferred Stock.

                           (B)  Dividends  on  outstanding  shares  of  Class  A
         Preferred  Stock shall be declared and paid,  or set apart for payment,
         before  any  dividends  shall be  declared  and paid,  or set apart for
         payment, on any class of common stock with respect to the same dividend
         period.  It the stated dividends on the shares of all series of Class A
         Preferred  Stock are not paid in full, the shares of all series of such
         class  shall  share  ratably  in the  payment  of  dividends  including
         accumulation,  if any,  in  accordance  with  the sums  which  would be
         payable on such shares if all dividends were declared and paid in full.

                           (C) In the  event  of any  voluntary  or  involuntary
         liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders
         of shares of each  series of Class A Preferred  Stock then  outstanding
         shall be  entitled  to receive  out of the  assets of the  Corporation,
         before any  distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any
         class of common stock, an amount equal to the stated value of the stock
         plus,  in respect of each share  with  respect to which  dividends  are
         cumulative,  a sum  computed at the dividend  rate  provided for in the
         Certificate of Incorporation from and after the date on which dividends
         on such shares  became  cumulative  to and including the date fixed for
         such  payment,  less the aggregate of the  dividends  theretofore  paid
         thereon,  but  computed  without  interest.  If the amounts  payable on
         liquidation in respect to the shares of all series of Class A Preferred
         Stock  are not paid in full,  the  shares of all  series of such  class
         shall share ratably in any  distribution of assets other than by way of
         dividends  in  accordance  with the sums which would be payable in such
         distribution  if all sums  payable  were  discharged  in full.  If such
         payment  shall  have been made in full to the  holders of all shares of
         Class A  Preferred  Stock  on  voluntary  or  involuntary  liquidation,
         dissolution or winding up of the  Corporation,  the remaining assets of
         the Corporation shall be distributed among the holders of each class of
         common stock pro rata in accordance with their respective holdings. For
         the  purpose  of this  paragraph,  a  consolidation  or  merger  of the
         Corporation with one or more other  corporations shall not be deemed to
         be a liquidation or winding up of the Corporation.

                           (D) First  Series  of Class A  Preferred  Stock.  The
         first  series of 1,000,000  shares of Class A Preferred  Stock shall be
         designated Ten Percent (10%)  Cumulative  Convertible  Voting Preferred
         Stock--Series  A, $0.25  stated value  (hereinafter  called "10% Voting
         Preferred Stock"), and shall have the following rights, preferences and
         limitations:

                                 (i)  Dividends.  The holders of the 10% Voting
         Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to receive,  when and as declared by
         the Board of Directors,  but only out of surplus legally  available for
         the payment of  dividends,  cumulative  cash  dividends  at the rate of
         $.025 per share per  annum,  and no more,  payable on the first days of
         January and July,  commencing  January l, 1984. Such dividends shall be
         payable  after all past and current  dividends  on the Six Percent (6%)
         Voting  Cumulative  Preferred Stock and the Preferred Stock Without Par
         Value have been  declared and paid,  or a sum  sufficient  therefor has
         been set aside for that purpose, and before any dividends (other than a
         stock  dividend  in shares of the same  class of stock) on any class of
         common  stock  shall be paid or set apart for  payment or any shares of
         such stock  shall be acquired  for  consideration.  Dividends  shall be
         cumulative  from and  after the date of issue of such  shares,  but any
         arrearages in payment shall not bear interest.

                               (ii)  Redemption.  Provided that dividends on the
         Six Percent (6%) Voting  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock and the Preferred
         Stock  Without Par Value have been paid or a sum set aside for payment,
         the  Corporation,  at the option of the Board of Directors,  may redeem
         all  or  any  part  of the  10%  Voting  Preferred  Stock  at any  time
         outstanding,  at any time or from time to time,  upon notice duly given
         as  hereinafter  provided  for an amount in respect of each share to be
         redeemed equal to the sum of $0.25 and an amount computed at the annual
         rate of $.025  per  annum  per  share  from and after the date on which
         dividends on such share became  cumulative  to and  including  the date
         fixed  for  such  redemption,  less  the  aggregate  of  the  dividends
         theretofore  and on such  redemption  date paid,  but computed  without
         interest.

                  Notice of every such redemption of 10% Voting  Preferred Stock
         shall be mailed at least  thirty  (30) days prior to the date fixed for
         such redemption to the holders of record of shares so to be redeemed at
         their respective addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the
         Corporation.  In case of  redemption  of a part only of the 10%  Voting
         Preferred  Stock at the time  outstanding,  the  shares to be  redeemed
         shall  be  selected  in such  manner  as the  Board  of  Directors  may
         determine,  whether by lot or by pro rata redemption or by selection of
         particular  shares,  and the  proceedings  and  actions of the Board of
         Directors in this connection  shall not be subject to attack except for
         fraud.

                             (iii)  Voting.  The holders of 10% Voting Preferred
         Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such stock on all
         questions presented to the stockholders of the Corporation.

                             (iv)  Conversion.  The holders of 10% Voting
         Preferred Stock shall have the right, at their option,  to convert such
         shares into shares of common stock,  $0.25 par value, at any time after
         the  issuance  thereof,  on and  subject  to the  following  terms  and
         conditions:

                           (a)  The  10%  Voting   Preferred   Stock   shall  be
                  convertible, at the office of the Corporation or at such other
                  office  or  offices,  if any,  as the Board of  Directors  may
                  designate,  into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class
                  A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (calculated as to each
                  conversion  to the nearest 1/10 of a share) at the  conversion
                  rate,  determined as  hereinafter  provided,  in effect at the
                  time of conversion. The conversion rate shall be one (l) share
                  of Class A Common  Stock  and one (1)  share of Class B Common
                  Stock for every  twenty  (20)  shares of 10% Voting  Preferred
                  Stock. In case the Corporation shall at any time subdivide its
                  outstanding  shares of common  stock into a greater  number of
                  shares or shall pay in shares of common  stock a  dividend  on
                  then outstanding  shares of common stock, the number of shares
                  of common stock into which the 10% Voting  Preferred  Stock is
                  convertible   shall   be   proportionately    increased   and,
                  conversely,  in case the Corporation shall at any time combine
                  its  outstanding  shares of common stock into a smaller number
                  of shares, the number of shares of common stock into which the
                  10%   Voting   Preferred   Stock  is   convertible   shall  be
                  proportionately  reduced.  If any  capital  reorganization  or
                  reclassification  of the capital stock of the Corporation,  or
                  any  consolidation  or merger of the Corporation  with another
                  corporation,  shall be  effected,  the  holder  of 10%  Voting
                  Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled upon the exercise
                  of conversion  rights to receive the number and kind of shares
                  of stock,  securities  or assets  which the holder  would have
                  been   entitled   to   receive   in   connection   with   such
                  reorganization,  recapitalization,  merger or consolidation if
                  he had been a holder of the  number of shares of common  stock
                  of the  Corporation  issuable  upon the  conversion of his 10%
                  Voting  Preferred  Stock  immediately  prior to the time  such
                  reorganization,  recapitalization,  merger,  or  consolidation
                  became  effective.  No  adjustment  shall  be  made  upon  any
                  conversion on account of any  dividends  accrued on the shares
                  of 10% Voting Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion or on
                  account of any  dividend on the shares of common  stock issued
                  on such conversion.

                           (b)  In  order  to  convert   shares  of  10%  Voting
                  Preferred  Stock  into  shares of  common  stock,  the  holder
                  thereof shall  surrender at the office of the  Corporation the
                  certificate  or  certificates  therefor,  duly endorsed to the
                  Corporation  or in  blank,  and give  written  notice  at such
                  office  that he elects to  convert  such  shares of 10% Voting
                  Preferred  Stock which shall be deemed to have been  converted
                  as of the date (hereinafter  called the "Conversion  Date") of
                  the surrender of such shares for conversion as provided above,
                  and the person or persons  entitled  to receive  the shares of
                  common stock  issuable upon such  conversion  shall be treated
                  for all  purposes  as the  record  holder or  holders  of such
                  common stock on such date. As soon as  practicable on or after
                  the  Conversion  Date,  the  Corporation  will deliver at such
                  office a certificate  or  certificates  for the number of full
                  shares of common stock issuable on such  conversion,  together
                  with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share,  as  hereinafter
                  provided, to the persons entitled to receive the same. In case
                  shares  of  10%   Voting   Preferred   Stock  are  called  for
                  redemption,  the right to convert  such shares shall cease and
                  terminate  at the  close of  business  on the date  fixed  for
                  redemption, unless default shall have been made in the payment
                  of the redemption price.

                           (c) No  fractional  shares of common  stock  shall be
                  issued upon conversion,  but the Corporation  shall pay a cash
                  adjustment  in respect of any  fraction of a share which would
                  otherwise be issuable, in an amount equal to the same fraction
                  of the market  price per share of common stock at the close of
                  business on the  Conversion  Date.  The market price per share
                  shall be, (i) if traded on the  over-the-counter  market,  the
                  mean between the closing bid and asked quotations,  or (ii) if
                  traded on a national  securities  exchange,  the closing  sale
                  price, or (iii) if traded on both the over-the-counter  market
                  and an  exchange,  the mean between the prices  determined  in
                  accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence.

                           (E) Second  Series of Class A  Preferred  Stock.  The
         second  series of 400,000  shares of Class A  Preferred  Stock shall be
         designated Ten Percent (10%)  Cumulative  Convertible  Voting Preferred
         Stock--Series  B, $0.25  stated  value  (hereinafter  called  "Series B
         Preferred Stock"), and shall have the following rights, preferences and
         limitations:

                                    (i)  Dividends.  The holders of the Series B
         Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to receive,  when and as declared by
         the Board of Directors,  but only out of surplus legally  available for
         the payment of  dividends,  cumulative  cash  dividends  at the rate of
         $.025 per share per  annum,  and no more,  payable on the first days of
         January and July,  commencing  July 1, 1985.  Such  dividends  shall be
         payable  after all past and current  dividends  on the Six Percent (6%)
         Voting  Cumulative  Preferred Stock and the Preferred Stock Without Par
         Value have been  declared and paid,  or a sum  sufficient  therefor has
         been set aside for that purpose, and before any dividends (other than a
         stock  dividend  in shares of the same  class of stock) on any class of
         common  stock  shall be paid or set apart for  payment or any shares of
         such stock  shall be acquired  for  consideration.  Dividends  shall be
         cumulative  from and  after the date of issue of such  shares,  but any
         arrearages in payment shall not bear interest.

                             (ii)  Redemption.  Provided that dividends on the
         Six Percent (6%) Voting  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock and the Preferred
         Stock  without Par Value have been paid or a sum set aside for payment,
         the  Corporation,  at the option of the Board of Directors,  may redeem
         all  or  any  part  of  the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  at  any  time
         outstanding,  at any time or from time to time,  upon notice duly given
         as  hereinafter  provided  for an amount in respect of each share to be
         redeemed  equal to the sum of  $0.25;  and an  amount  computed  at the
         annual  rate of $.025 per  annum  per share  from and after the date on
         which  dividends on such share became  cumulative  to and including the
         date fixed for such  redemption,  less the  aggregate of the  dividends
         theretofore  and on such  redemption  date paid,  but computed  without
         interest.

                    Notice of every such redemption of Series
         B Preferred  Stock  shall be mailed at least  thirty (30) days prior to
         the date fixed for such  redemption  to the holders of record of shares
         so to be  redeemed  at their  respective  addresses  as the same  shall
         appear on the books of the Corporation. In case of redemption of a part
         only of the  Series B  Preferred  Stock at the  time  outstanding,  the
         shares to be redeemed  shall be selected in such manner as the Board of
         Directors may determine, whether by lot or by pro rata redemption or by
         selection of particular  shares, and the proceedings and actions of the
         Board of  Directors in this  connection  shall not be subject to attack
         except for fraud.

                             (iii)  Voting.  The holders of Series B Preferred
         Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of such stock in all
         questions presented to the stockholders of the Corporation.

                              (iv)  Conversion.  The holders of Series B
         Preferred Stock shall have the right, at their option,  to convert such
         shares into shares of common stock,  $0.25 par value, at any time after
         the  issuance  thereof,  on and  subject  to the  following  terms  and
         conditions:

                           (a)  The   Series   B   Preferred   Stock   shall  be
                  convertible, at the office of the Corporation or at such other
                  office  or  offices,  if any,  as the Board of  Directors  may
                  designate,  into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class
                  A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (calculated as to each
                  conversion  to the nearest 1/10 of a share) at the  conversion
                  rate,  determined as  hereinafter  provided,  in effect at the
                  time of conversion. The conversion rate shall be one (1) share
                  of Class A Common  Stock  and one (1)  share of Class B Common
                  Stock  for every  thirty  (30)  shares  of Series B  Preferred
                  Stock. In case the Corporation shall at any time subdivide its
                  outstanding  shares of common  stock into a greater  number of
                  shares or shall pay in shares of common  stock a  dividend  on
                  then outstanding  shares of common stock, the number of shares
                  of common  stock into which the  Series B  Preferred  Stock is
                  convertible   shall   be   proportionately    increased   and,
                  conversely,  in case the Corporation shall at any time combine
                  its  outstanding  shares of common stock into a smaller number
                  of shares, the number of shares of common stock into which the
                  Series   B   Preferred   Stock   is   convertible   shall   be
                  proportionately  reduced.  If any  capital  reorganization  or
                  reclassification  of the capital stock of the Corporation,  or
                  any  consolidation  or merger of the Corporation  with another
                  corporation,  shall  be  effected,  the  holder  of  Series  B
                  Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled upon the exercise
                  of conversion  rights to receive the number and kind of shares
                  of stock,  securities  or assets  which the holder  would have
                  been   entitled   to   receive   in   connection   with   such
                  reorganization,  recapitalization,  merger or consolidation if
                  he had been a holder of the  number of shares of common  stock
                  of the Corporation  issuable upon the conversion of his Series
                  B  Preferred  Stock   immediately   prior  to  the  time  such
                  reorganization,  recapitalization,  merger,  or  consolidation
                  became  effective.  No  adjustment  shall  be  made  upon  any
                  conversion on account of any  dividends  accrued on the shares
                  of Series B Preferred  Stock  surrendered for conversion or on
                  account of any  dividend on the shares of common  stock issued
                  on such conversion.

                           (b) In order to convert  shares of Series B Preferred
                  Stock into shares of common  stock,  the holder  thereof shall
                  surrender at the office of the  Corporation the certificate or
                  certificates therefor,  duly endorsed to the Corporation or in
                  blank,  and give written  notice at such office that he elects
                  to convert such shares of Series B Preferred Stock which shall
                  be deemed to have been  converted as of the date  (hereinafter
                  called the "Conversion  Date") of the surrender of such shares
                  for  conversion as provided  above,  and the person or persons
                  entitled to receive the shares of common stock  issuable  upon
                  such  conversion  shall be  treated  for all  purposes  as the
                  record holder or holders of such common stock on such date. As
                  soon as  practicable  on or after  the  Conversion  Date,  the
                  Corporation  will  deliver  at such  office a  certificate  or
                  certificates  for the  number of full  shares of common  stock
                  issuable on such conversion, together with cash in lieu of any
                  fraction of a share, as hereinafter  provided,  to the persons
                  entitled  to  receive  the  same.  In case  shares of Series B
                  Preferred  Stock  are  called  for  redemption,  the  right to
                  convert such shares shall cease and  terminate at the close of
                  business  on the date  fixed for  redemption,  unless  default
                  shall have been made in the payment of the redemption price.

                           (c) No  fractional  shares of common  stock  shall be
                  issued upon conversion,  but the Corporation  shall pay a cash
                  adjustment  in respect of any  fraction of a share which would
                  otherwise be issuable, in an amount equal to the same fraction
                  of the market  price per share of common stock at the close of
                  business on the  Conversion  Date.  The market price per share
                  shall be, (i) if traded on the  over-the-counter  market,  the
                  mean between the closing bid and asked quotations,  or (ii) if
                  traded on a national  securities  exchange,  the closing  sale
                  price, or (iii) if traded on both the over-the-counter  market
                  and an  exchange,  the mean between the prices  determined  in
                  accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence.

                  (e)      Provisions Generally Applicable to Capital Stock.

                           (A) No holder of shares of the  Capital  Stock of any
         class of the  Corporation  shall have any  preemptive  or  preferential
         right  of  subscription  to any  shares  of any  class  of stock of the
         Corporation, whether now or hereafter authorized, or to any obligations
         convertible  into  stock of the  Corporation,  issued or sold,  nor any
         right of  subscription  to any thereof  other than such, if any, as the
         Board of Directors, in its discretion,  may from time to time determine
         and at such  price as the Board of  Directors  may,  from time to time,
         fix;  and any  shares  of stock or  convertible  obligations  which the
         Corporation  may determine to offer for  subscription to the holders of
         stock may, as the Board of  Directors  shall  determine,  be offered to
         holders of any class or classes of stock  exclusively  or to holders of
         all  classes of stock,  and if offered to more than one class of stock,
         in such  proportions  as between the said classes of stock as the Board
         of Directors in its discretion may determine.

                           As   used  in  this   Section   (e)  the   expression
         "convertible  obligations"  shall  include  any  notes,  bonds or other
         evidences  of  indebtedness  to which are  attached  or with  which are
         issued warrants or other rights to purchase stock of the Corporation of
         any class or classes;  and the Board of Directors  is hereby  expressly
         authorized,  in its  discretion,  in  connection  with the issue of any
         obligations or stock of the Corporation  (but without  intending hereby
         to limit its general power as to do in any other cases) to grant rights
         or options to purchase stock of the  Corporation of any class upon such
         terms  and  during  such  periods  as  the  Board  of  Directors  shall
         determine,  and to cause such rights or options to be evidenced by such
         warrants or other instruments as it may deem advisable.

                  (B) The Board of  Directors  may  authorize  the  purchase  of
         shares  of Class A Common  Stock or Class B Common  Stock or any  other
         class  of  stock  or any  combination  of  classes  without  regard  to
         differences  among the  classes in price or other terms upon which such
         shares may be purchased.

         FOURTH: Upon the filing of this certificate by the Department of State,

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Because of the food  processing  segment,  the Company's  yearly  business cycle
shows large  inventory  growth  during the summer and fall harvest  period.  The
inventory  peaks in the early winter and drops to its minimum level  immediately
prior to the next  pack  season.  These  peaks  are  financed  through  seasonal
borrowings whose high and low points essentially  correspond with the changes in
inventory, or by a reduction in short-term investments.
Accordingly, inventory management is key to liquidity.

During  December 1995 the Company sold its Peabody,  Massachusetts  facility for
cash  resulting in net cash  proceeds of $6.3 million and a gain of $4.3 million
before  income tax  expense.  The Company  had leased  this  facility to a third
party.  In addition,  during  September 1995 the Company entered into a sale and
leaseback  transaction  whereby three of its  wastewater  facilities in New York
State were sold to the Wayne County Water and Sewer  Authority  for net proceeds
of $9.3 million.

During February 1995 the Company acquired certain assets (see Acquisitions, note
12) of the  Green  Giant  Division  of The  Pillsbury  Company  (referred  to as
"Pillsbury"), a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan Incorporated. Under an Alliance
Agreement concurrently executed by the Company, Pillsbury and Grand Metropolitan
Incorporated,  Pillsbury will continue to be  responsible  for all of the sales,
marketing and customer  service  functions for the Green Giant brand,  while the
Company  will handle  vegetable  processing  and canning  operations.  Pillsbury
continues  to own all the  trademark  rights  to the Green  Giant  brand and its
proprietary  seed varieties.  The assets acquired  included certain raw material
and  supplies  inventory  and  six  manufacturing   facilities  located  in  the
Midwestern and Northwestern  United States.  The purchase price of $86.1 million
was funded by a  subordinated  note issued by the Company for $73.0  million and
the balance was funded out of working capital.  This subordinated note decreased
$6.0  million in 1996 as a result of an  agreement  reached  with  Pillsbury  to
convert that amount to the Company's  Class A Common Stock.  Such conversion was
completed  in  March  1996.  The  subordinated  note  is  expected  to  increase
approximately  $8.0 million in 1997 due to the addition of capital projects that
Pillsbury  has  completed  and green bean  processing  equipment  acquired  from
Pillsbury which is being transferred to the Company.

In  conjunction  with this  acquisition,  the Company  entered  into a revolving
credit  facility for up to $150.0  million from a syndicate of eleven banks.  In
addition,  the Company  issued two new senior debt notes.  The first was a $75.0
million  unsecured note issued to The Prudential  Insurance  Company of America,
with  repayment due  beginning in March 1998, a final  maturity date of February
2005,  and an interest rate of 10.78% (see Long-Term  Debt,  note 4). The second
was a $50.0 million  unsecured note issued to John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Company, with repayment due beginning in March 2001, a final maturity of January
2009, and an interest rate of 10.81%.  The proceeds of these two notes were used
to  finance  or  replenish  working  capital  for  the  following:   1)  capital
expenditures of $50.0 million related to the Alliance  Agreement with Pillsbury;
2) repayment of two notes due an insurance company,  one repaid in July 1994 for
$13.8 million,  the other repaid when the new debt was issued for $26.6 million;
3) three small acquisitions made over the previous fifteen months totaling $15.6
million;  and 4) the balance,  $19.0 million, for capital expenditures made over
the previous three years.

During  1994  the  Company  prepaid  an issue of high  interest  long-term  debt
totaling $13.8 million.  This resulted in an extraordinary  loss of $0.6 million
after taxes. Also during 1994 the Company made two small  acquisitions  totaling
$11.7 million.  The debt  prepayment and  acquisitions  were funded from working
capital (see below) and current operations. During 1994 and 1993 the Company had
no new long-term financing.

As mentioned above,  during 1995 the Company entered into an unsecured revolving
credit agreement for up to $150.0 million.  Previously,  the Company  maintained
uncommitted lines of credit.  The peak borrowings  reached $144.2 million during
1996. Credit lines provide for interest rate options based on Prime, Eurodollar,
or Money Market. There were $113.0 million of borrowings outstanding under these
lines at the end of 1996,  $1.6 million at the end of 1994,  and none at the end
of 1995 and 1993.

The decrease in cash and  short-term  investments of $6.6 million over the three
and  two-thirds  year  period  ended in 1996 was  primarily  due to Green  Giant
acquisition of $86.1 million, the debt prepayments totaling $40.4 million; three
small acquisitions  totaling $15.6 million;  the common stock retirement of $5.1
million;  capital additions of $67.9 million,  $27.0 million,  $9.4 million, and
$1.7 million, in 1996, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively; and smaller items not
identified.  This was partially offset by the proceeds of the four new long-term
debt issues totaling  $207.3 million;  proceeds from the disposal of the textile
segment of $8.4 million;  an income tax refund in 1993 of $4.2 million;  and net
earnings.


<PAGE>


The 1996 capital  expenditures of $67.9 million are substantially due to a major
capital  expansion,  which began in 1995,  integrated six of  Pillsbury's  Green
Giant vegetable processing plants and significantly  increased the Company's own
production  capabilities to accommodate the production of four Pillsbury  plants
that were concurrently closed. This capital expansion was originally expected to
be $50.0 million,  but to meet our ambitious  goals, an additional $25.0 million
was spent on this project,  primarily in our New York State  operations in order
to meet  operational  needs of the Alliance.  The 1995 capital  expenditures  of
$27.0 million largely reflect spending related to the Alliance with Pillsbury as
mentioned above. During 1994 capital expenditures were higher than both 1993 and
1992. During 1995 the Company began installation of a green bean processing line
in the Eastern Division,  cold storage facilities in the Central Division in the
midwest  and  northwest,  and a frozen  vegetable  processing  expansion  in the
Central Division.  During 1994 the Company upgraded its vegetable processing and
juice bottling equipment in the Eastern Division.

During August 1993 the Company sold its textile division for approximately  $8.4
million.  It  represented  about  6% of  the  Company's  assets  and  13% of the
Company's sales in 1993.

Subsequent to the 1996  year-end,  the Company sold its  investment in Moog Inc.
Class A Common  Stock back to Moog  which  generated  $12.9  million in net cash
proceeds.  In  addition,  besides  the  proceeds  from the sale of the  Peabody,
Massachusetts facility in 1996 mentioned above for $6.3 million, the Company has
entered into an agreement to sell its Clifton Park, New York warehouse  later in
1997, which will generate an additional $2.5 million in net cash proceeds.

Results of Operations

During 1995, the Company  changed its fiscal  year-end to March 31 from July 31.
With the  acquisition  of the Green Giant  plants,  vegetables  now  represent a
substantial  portion of the  Company's  business.  The July year-end fell in the
middle of the pack season for certain  vegetable  commodities  while March 31 is
before the pack season begins.

Net sales for 1996 were $508.0 million which includes $152.0 million of sales to
Pillsbury under the Alliance.  If 1996 net sales are compared with the last full
year sales (1994),  the increase for the two year period is 22.7%  excluding the
effect of the  Alliance.  The Company's  sales were $234.1  million in the eight
month  transition  period ended 1995. It is not  appropriate  to annualize  this
amount since  vegetables tend to be sold on a more seasonal basis. A full year's
sales in 1995 would have shown an increase over 1994.  Sales  increased by 12.7%
in 1994 and decreased 8.0% in 1993.

In 1996  vegetable  unit sales were lower due to a less than budget  pack.  Unit
vegetable  selling prices  dropped in 1996,  while apple pricing rose due to the
world-wide  shortage of processing  apples.  In 1995  vegetable  unit sales were
sharply higher due to the  industry-wide  large packs.  Unit selling prices were
down which partially  offset the vegetable dollar sales increases due to volume.
The three small  acquisitions  (one in 1995 and two in 1994) also contributed to
the increase (see Acquisitions, note 12). In 1994 vegetable sales increased 9.5%
due to sharply higher unit selling prices that resulted from 1993's  flooding in
the  midwest.  In 1994 fruit and juice  sales  were up 16.7% led by apple  juice
which was up 9.3%. The two small  acquisitions  also contributed to the increase
(see Acquisitions, note 12). In 1993 vegetable sales declined 12.4% due to lower
unit sales and selling  prices while apple and grape sales  declined by 8.4% and
2.1%,  respectively.  This was partially offset by an increase in co-pack sales.
Vegetable sales  decreased due, in part, to a continued  oversupply of processed
vegetables in the industry.

The 1996 results include a non-recurring charge of $15.1 million,  before income
tax benefit,  due to a  combination  of start-up  costs related to the Pillsbury
Alliance and severe drought  conditions in New York State  throughout the entire
summer. The Company undertook an ambitious capital  expenditure  program related
to the Pillsbury  Alliance.  In the  relatively  short time between the February
1995 closing of the Pillsbury  Alliance and the beginning of the 1995  vegetable
pack, 37 separate major capital projects needed to be completed. There were some
unforeseen  problems related to a few of these projects,  mostly in the New York
plants.  Some of the used  equipment  transferred  from the  closed  plants  had
operating  difficulties  and were  not  always  easily  repaired,  thus  causing
downtime.  Therefore,  plant  throughput  and  yields  were poor at some  plants
resulting in unfavorable  manufacturing  variances.  The problems were magnified
when the  drought  and the hot weather  conditions  forced the uneven  timing of
maturities of vegetables.

In 1996  earnings  decreased  for the  following  reasons:  1) the $15.1 million
non-recurring charge detailed above, 2) higher apple cost of product sold due to
a world-wide  shortage of  processing  apples,  and 3) lower  selling  prices on
vegetables due to an ongoing  industry  oversupply.  In 1995 earnings  decreased
due, in part, to lower selling prices caused by an  industry-wide  oversupply of
processed  vegetables.  In 1994 earnings increased for the following reasons: 1)
lower apple cost of product  sold due to a greater  availability  of apples,  2)
higher  selling  prices on  vegetables  which more than  offset  higher  cost of
product sold,  3) the sale of the textile  segment and, 4) the $2.0 million gain
due to  implementing  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) 109,
"Accounting  for Income  Taxes" (see  Income  Taxes,  note 6). In 1993  earnings
increased for the following reasons:  1) lower apple cost of product sold due to
a greater  availability of apples, 2) lower interest cost since there were lower
short-term  rates, 3) the  refinancing of some Industrial  Revenue Bonds and, 4)
the $1.7  million of interest  income from the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (see
Income Taxes, note 6).


<PAGE>


In 1996, the Company  changed its inventory  valuation  method from the lower of
cost; last-in,  first-out; or market to the lower of cost; first-in,  first-out;
or market.  The major  reason for  changing to the FIFO  method is because,  the
majority of the Company's  production and inventories are designated for sale to
Pillsbury  (under  the  Alliance  Agreement)  at prices  based upon FIFO cost of
production by pack year. In addition,  the increase in the Company's  production
volume resulting from the Alliance  Agreement,  and other factors,  has caused a
reduction in the overhead cost per unit of the Company's other production,  thus
changing the basic cost structure of the Company's non-Pillsbury production. The
change has been applied  retroactively by restating the financial  statements of
prior years (see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, note 1).

In general,  inflation played a relatively  small role in the operating  results
and cash flows of 1996,  1995,  1994 and 1993 since the Company  depreciates its
fixed assets under accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes.

Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - SFAS 121

Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 121,  "Accounting  for
Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of,"
must be adopted by the Company in 1997.  The standard  requires that  impairment
losses be recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value.
The Company regularly  assesses all of its long-lived assets for impairment and,
therefore,  does not believe the adoption of the  standard  will have a material
effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Seneca Foods Corporation and Subsidiaries

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations - The Company conducts its business almost entirely in food
processing  operating  28 plants and  warehouses  in nine  states.  The  Company
markets  branded and  private  label  processed  foods to retail  customers  and
institutional food distributors.

Accounting  Period - In 1995, the Company  changed its fiscal  year-end to March
31. Fiscal 1995 is an eight-month transition period ended March 31, 1995.

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts for the parent Company and all of its wholly-owned  subsidiaries  after
elimination of intercompany transactions, profits, and balances.

Revenue  Recognition  - Sales and related  cost of product  sold are  recognized
primarily upon shipment of products.

Concentration of Credit Risk - Financial  instruments  that potentially  subject
the Company to credit risk  consist of trade  receivables  and  interest-bearing
investments.  Wholesale  and retail  food  distributors  comprise a  significant
portion  of  the  trade  receivables;  collateral  is  not  required.  The  risk
associated  with  the  concentration  is  limited  due to the  large  number  of
wholesalers  and retailers and their  geographic  dispersion.  During 1996,  the
Company sold to Pillsbury $152,013,000 of canned and frozen vegetables under its
Alliance  Agreement (see  Acquisitions,  note 12), which  represented 30% of net
sales.

The Company  places  substantially  all its  interest-bearing  investments  with
financial institutions and monitors credit exposure.

Cash and  Short-Term  Investments - For purposes of the statement of cash flows,
the Company considers all highly liquid instruments  purchased for a maturity of
three months or less as short-term investments.

Inventories  -  Inventories  are  stated at lower of cost;  first-in,  first-out
(FIFO);  or market.  During 1996,  the Company  changed its inventory  valuation
method from the lower of cost last-in, first-out (LIFO); or market, to the lower
of cost; FIFO; or market. The change has been applied retroactively by restating
the financial  statements for prior years.  The major reason for changing to the
FIFO method is because, the majority of the Company's production and inventories
are  designated for sale to Pillsbury  (under the Alliance  Agreement) at prices
based upon FIFO cost of production  by pack year.  In addition,  the increase in
the Company's production volume resulting from the Alliance Agreement, and other
factors,  has caused a reduction in the overhead  cost per unit of the Company's
other  production,  thus  changing  the basic cost  structure  of the  Company's
non-Pillsbury  production.  The cumulative  effect of the change (reported as an
increase in retained earnings as of July 31, 1992) of $5,262,000  represents the
effect on net  earnings of the  reversal of the LIFO  reserve at that date.  The
effect of this accounting change on net earnings as previously reported follows:

Income Taxes - The provision for income taxes  includes  federal,  foreign,  and
state income taxes  currently  payable and those  deferred  because of temporary
differences  between  the  financial  statement  and tax  bases  of  assets  and
liabilities.

Depreciation - Property,  plant, and equipment is stated at cost or, in the case
of capital  leases,  the present value of future lease  payments.  For financial
reporting,  the Company provides for depreciation and capital lease amortization
on the  straight-line  method at rates based upon the estimated  useful lives of
the various assets.

Earnings per Common Share - Primary  earnings  per share are  calculated  on the
basis of weighted average common shares  outstanding  since the effect of common
stock  equivalents  is  immaterial.  The  difference  between  primary and fully
diluted  earnings per share is also  immaterial.  Prior year  earnings per share
have been restated to reflect the stock split in the form of a dividend.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amount of assets and  liabilities  and the  disclosure of contingent  assets and
liabilities  at the date of the  financial  statements,  as well as the  related
revenues and expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual amounts could differ
from  those  estimated.   The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the
Company's  estimate of its liability to Pillsbury  under the Alliance  Agreement
for inventory costing adjustments.

5.  Leases

The Company leases a portion of its equipment and buildings.  Capitalized leases
consist  primarily of industrial  development  agency financing  instruments and
limited obligation special revenue bonds which bear interest rates from 3.55% to
6.75%. Other leases include non-cancelable  operating leases expiring at various
dates through 2016.

During 1996, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback  transaction  whereby
three of its  wastewater  facilities in New York State were sold for  $9,258,000
and leased back under a 20-year lease  agreement.  This  transaction  produced a
gain of $4,178,000  which was deferred and is being  amortized  over the 20-year
lease period.

Leased assets under capital leases consist of the following:

In August, 1992 the Internal Revenue Service completed its audit of fiscal years
1983 and 1984.  This  conclusion  allowed the Company to file a refund claim for
the years 1985 and 1986.  This refund was  received  during the 1993 fiscal year
resulting in a $1,000,000  reduction in the provision for income taxes.  Also in
1993, interest income of $1,680,000 has been netted against the interest expense
category in the Consolidated Statements of Net Earnings.

At March  31,  1996,  the  Company  has  Research  and  Development  Credits  to
carryforward  in the amount of $83,000 of which  $31,000 will expire in the year
2010 and $52,000 will expire in 2011, and Alternative Minimum Tax Credits in the
amount of  $1,176,000  to offset  future years  regular tax  expense.  State Net
Operating Loss carryforwards of approximately $4,661,000 are available to offset
future state tax  expense,  approximately  one-half  will expire in 2001 and the
balance will expire in 2012.

The  cumulative  effect of the  adoption  of SFAS No.  109 on August 1, 1993 was
$2,006,000.  This change is reported in the 1994 Consolidated  Statements of Net
Earnings.  As permitted under this rule,  prior years financial  statements have
not been restated to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 109.

7.  Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock - The outstanding 10% cumulative,  convertible, voting preferred
stock consists of 407,240 Series A shares, convertible at the rate of one common
share for every twenty  preferred  shares,  and 400,000  Series B shares,  which
carry a one for thirty  conversion  rate.  The Series A and B shares have a $.25
stated value and a $.025 par value.  There are  2,600,000  shares  authorized of
Class A $.025 par value stock which are unissued and  undesignated.  In addition
there  are  30,000   shares  of  no  par  stock  which  are  also  unissued  and
undesignated.

Common  Stock  -  A  proposed   amendment  to  the  Company's   Certificate   of
Incorporation  which  effected a  recapitalization  of the Company by creating a
second class of common stock (which was  distributed to all common  shareholders
as a stock  split in the form of a dividend)  was adopted at the Annual  Meeting
held on August 5, 1995. This  recapitalization  amendment (i)  reclassified  the
existing  Common Stock as Class B Common Stock,  (ii)  authorized a new class of
10,000,000  shares  designated as Class A Common Stock and (iii) established the
express  terms of the Class A Common  Stock and the  Class B Common  Stock.  The
Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock have  substantially  identical
rights  with  respect to any  dividends  or  distributions  of cash or  property
declared on shares of common  stock and rank  equally as to the right to receive
proceeds on  liquidation  or  dissolution  of the Company  after  payment of the
Company's indebtedness and liquidation right to the holders of preferred shares.
However,  holders of Class B Common Stock  retain a full vote per share  whereas
the holders of Class A Common Stock have voting rights of 1/20th of one vote per
share on all matters as to which  shareholders  of the  Company are  entitled to
vote.

In 1996, the Company  reached an agreement with Pillsbury to convert  $6,000,000
of its  subordinated  note into 346,570  shares of the Company's  Class A Common
Stock.

Unissued  shares of common stock reserved for conversion  privileges were 33,695
at March 31, 1996 and 1995 and July 31, 1994 and 1993.

The second quarter of 1996 results include a nonrecurring  charge of $15,078,000
before  income tax  benefit,  due to  start-up  costs  related to the  Pillsbury
Alliance (see Acquisitions, Note 12).

The 1995 and 1994 results have been  restated to reflect the change in 1996 from
the LIFO inventory  valuation method to the FIFO inventory  valuation method and
to reflect the stock split in the form of a dividend.

Earnings  for the fourth  quarter  (third  quarter  in 1995)  have  historically
reflected  adjustments of previously estimated raw material costs and production
levels.  Due to the  dependence on fruit and  vegetable  yields of the Company's
food processing segment, interim costing must be estimated.

12. Acquisitions

On  February  10, 1995 the Company  acquired  certain  assets of the Green Giant
Division of The Pillsbury Company (referred to as "Pillsbury"),  a subsidiary of
Grand  Metropolitan  Incorporated.  Under  an  Alliance  Agreement  concurrently
executed  by  the  Company,   Pillsbury  and  Grand  Metropolitan  Incorporated,
Pillsbury  will continue to be responsible  for all of the sales,  marketing and
customer  service  functions  for the Green Giant brand,  while the Company will
handle vegetable  processing and canning operations.  Pillsbury continues to own
all the  trademark  rights to the Green  Giant  brand and its  proprietary  seed
varieties.  The assets  acquired  include  certain  raw  material  and  supplies
inventory  and  six  manufacturing  facilities  located  in the  Midwestern  and
Northwestern  United  States.  The purchase price was based on the book value of
the assets  acquired.  The purchase price of $86,093,000 was funded by a secured
nonrecourse  subordinated  promissory note issued by the Company for $73,025,000
and the balance was funded out of working capital.

On August 17,  1994 the  Company  acquired  the assets of M.C.  Snack,  Inc.  of
Yakima,  Washington,  a snack food maker of apple chips.  The purchase price was
$3,769,000 which was funded out of working capital.

On December 20, 1993 the Company acquired certain assets of ERLY Juice, Inc. and
WorldMark,  Inc. The assets  acquired  include  certain  trademarks,  inventory,
accounts  receivable,  and  manufacturing  facilities  located  in  Eau  Claire,
Michigan.  Most of the products are sold under the TreeSweet brand. The purchase
price was $8,372,000 which was funded out of working capital.

The Company acquired the Wapato,  Washington juice processing business of Sanofi
Bio-Industries,  Inc. on November 30, 1993.  The purchase  price was  $3,298,000
which was funded out of working capital.

All acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method and,  accordingly,
the operating  results of the acquired  have been  included in the  consolidated
operating results since the dates of acquisition.

13.  Other Income.

Other  income  in  1996  consisted  of the  gain  on the  sale  of the  Peabody,
Massachusetts warehouse totaling $4,271,000 before income taxes.

14.  Non-Recurring Charge.

The 1996 operating results include a non-recurring charge of $15,078,000, before
income tax  benefit,  due to a  combination  of  start-up  costs  related to the
Pillsbury  Alliance and severe drought  conditions in New York State  throughout
the entire  summer.  The Company  undertook  an  ambitious  capital  expenditure
program related to the Pillsbury Alliance.  In the relatively short time between
the February  1995 closing of the  Pillsbury  Alliance and the  beginning of the
1995 vegetable pack, 37 separate major capital  projects needed to be completed.
There were some unforeseen  problems related to a few of these projects,  mostly
in the New York plants.  Some of the used equipment  transferred from the closed
plants had  operating  difficulties  and were not always easily  repaired,  thus
causing  downtime.  Throughput and yields were poor at some plants  resulting in
unfavorable  manufacturing  variances.  The  problems  were  magnified  when the
drought and the hot weather conditions forced the uneven timing of maturities of
vegetables.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Board of Directors
   and Stockholders of
Seneca Foods Corporation
Pittsford, New York

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Seneca Foods
Corporation and  subsidiaries as of March 31, 1996,  March 31, 1995 and July 31,
1994,  and the related  consolidated  statements of net earnings,  stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for the year ended March 31, 1996, the eight months ended
March 31, 1995 and for each of the two years in the period  ended July 31, 1994.
These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's  management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of Seneca  Foods  Corporation  and
subsidiaries  as of March 31, 1996,  March 31, 1995 and July 31,  1994,  and the
results of their  operations  and their cash flows for the year ended  March 31,
1996, the eight months ended March 31, 1995 and for each of the two years in the
period ended July 31, 1994 in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,  in fiscal 1996
the Company changed its method of accounting for inventories and, retroactively,
restated the 1995,  1994,  and 1993  consolidated  financial  statements for the
change.   Further,  as  discussed  in  Note  6  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements,  in fiscal 1994 the Company  changed  its method of  accounting  for
income taxes to conform with  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.
109.
