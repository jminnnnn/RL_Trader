                                    Business

                         General Development of Business

SENECA FOODS CORPORATION  (herein referred to as the "Company") was organized in
1949 and  incorporated  under the laws of the State of New  York.  Seneca  Foods
Corporation  purchased six Green  Giant(R)  vegetable  plants from The Pillsbury
Company  effective  February 1, 1995,  resulting in vegetable  products becoming
nearly 80% of  Seneca's  overall  business.  Consequently  during  1995,  Seneca
changed its fiscal year-end from July 31 to March 31 to avoid  overlapping  pack
seasons  between  fiscal  years.  Therefore,  Fiscal  1995  was  an  eight-month
transition period.

                  Financial Information About Industry Segments

The Company's  business  activities are conducted in food and non-food segments.
The food  segment is food  processing.  The  non-food  segment is an air charter
service.  The air charter  service  represents 1% of the Company's  business and
therefore the financial information related to segments is not material.

                        Narrative Description of Business

                         Principal Products and Markets

Food Processing

The principal  products of this segment include grape products,  apple products,
and  vegetables.  The products are canned,  bottled,  and frozen and are sold to
retail and institutional markets. The Company has divided the United States into
four  major   marketing   sections:   Eastern,   Southern,   Northwestern,   and
Southwestern.  Plant  locations  in New  York,  Michigan,  North  Carolina,  and
Washington  provide  ready access to the  domestic  sources of grapes and apples
necessary  to support  marketing  efforts in their  respective  sections  of the
country.  Vegetable operations are primarily supported by plant locations in New
York,  Wisconsin,  Washington,  Idaho, and Minnesota.  In addition,  the Company
operated a mushroom canning facility in Pennsylvania.

The following  summarizes  net sales by major category for the years ended March
31, 1998, 1997, and 1996:

                     Source and Availability of Raw Material

Food Processing

The Company's food processing plants are located in major vegetable,  grape, and
apple producing  states.  Fruits and vegetables are primarily  obtained  through
contracts with growers.  Apple concentrate is purchased  domestically and abroad
to supplement  raw fruit  purchased  under  contract.  The Company's  sources of
supply are considered  equal or superior to its  competition for all of its food
products.


                                Seasonal Business

Food Processing

While  individual  fruits and vegetables have seasonal cycles of peak production
and sales,  the  different  cycles are usually  offsetting  to some extent.  The
supply of  commodities,  current  pricing,  and expected  new crop  quantity and
quality  affect the timing of the Company's  sales and  earnings.  An Off Season
Allowance  is  established  during the year to  minimize  the effect of seasonal
production on earnings. Off Season Allowance is zero at fiscal year-end.


                                     Backlog

Food Processing

In the food  processing  business  the end of year  sales  order  backlog is not
considered  meaningful.   Traditionally,   larger  customers  provide  tentative
bookings for their expected  purchases for the upcoming  season.  These bookings
are further  developed  as data on the  expected  size of the  related  national
harvests  becomes  available.  In general these  bookings  serve as a yardstick,
rather than as a firm commitment,  since actual harvest results can vary notably
from early estimates.  In actual practice,  the Company has substantially all of
its expected  seasonal  production  identified to potential sales outlets before
the seasonal production is completed.


                            Competition and Customers

Food Processing

Competition  in  the  food  business  is  substantial  with  imaginative   brand
registration,  quality service,  and pricing being the major determinants in the
Company's  relative  market  position.  Except  for the  Seneca  apple and grape
products  and Libby's  vegetable  products  data  mentioned  below,  no reliable
statistics are available to establish the exact market position of the Company's
own food  products.  During  the past year  approximately  19% of the  Company's
processed  foods were  packed for retail  customers  under the  Company  branded
labels of Libby's(R),  TreeSweet(R), Blue Boy(R), Aunt Nellie's Farm Kitchen(R),
and Seneca(R).  About 11% of the processed  foods were packed for  institutional
food  distributors  and 30% of  processed  foods were  retail  packed  under the
private  label of  customers.  The  remaining  40% is sold  under  the  Alliance
Agreement  with  Pillsbury  (see  note 13 of Item 8,  Financial  Statements  and
Supplementary Data). Termination of the Alliance Agreement would have a material
adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.  The customers  represent a full
cross section of the retail, institutional,  distributor, and industrial markets
and the Company  does not consider  itself  dependent on any single sales source
other than sales attributable to the Alliance Agreement.

The principal branded products are Seneca Frozen Apple Juice Concentrate,  rated
the number one seller nationally, Seneca Frozen Natural Grape Juice Concentrate,
Seneca  applesauce,  and Libby's canned vegetable  products which rate among the
top five  national  brands.  The  information  under the heading  Liquidity  and
Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and  Results  of  Operations  in the  1998  Annual  Report  is  incorporated  by
reference.
                            Environmental Protection

Environmental  protection is an area that has been worked on most  diligently at
each food processing facility.  In all locations the Company has cooperated with
federal, state, and local environmental protection authorities in developing and
maintaining suitable  antipollution  facilities.  In general,  pollution control
facilities are equal to or somewhat superior to those of our competitors and are
within  environmental  protection  standards.  The  Company  does not expect any
material capital  expenditures to comply with  environmental  regulations in the
near future. The Company is a potentially  responsible party with respect to two
sites but the Company does not believe the aggregate liability is material.

                               Foreign Operations

Export sales for the Company are a relatively  small  portion  (about 5%) of the
food processing sales.


                                     Item 2

                                   Properties

The Company has eleven food processing,  packaging,  and warehousing  facilities
located in New York State that provide  approximately  2,054,000  square feet of
food packaging, freezing and freezer storage, and warehouse storage space. These
facilities  process and package fruit and vegetable  products.  The Company is a
lessee under a number of operating  and capital  leases for  equipment  and real
property used for processing and warehousing.

Five other processing,  packaging, and warehousing facilities are located in the
states  of North  Carolina  (223,000  square  feet),  and in  Washington  (three
locations totaling 292,000 square feet). Processing operations in North Carolina
are primarily devoted to apple juice products; in Washington, grape juice, apple
juice, apple chips, and sauce.

Five  facilities  in  Minnesota,  one  facility  in  Michigan,  one  facility in
Washington,  one  facility  in  Idaho,  one  facility  in  Kentucky,  and  seven
facilities  in Wisconsin  provide  approximately  5,459,000  square feet of food
packaging,  freezing and freezer  storage,  and warehouse  storage space.  These
facilities  process  and  package  various  vegetable  and fruit  products.  The
facilities are owned by the Company.

The  Company  owns one food  distribution  facility  in  Massachusetts  totaling
approximately  59,000 square feet which is leased out to another company through
2004.  Sublease  income of $271,000  was  received on this  facility  during the
period. In addition the air charter division has a 14,000 square foot facility.

All of the  properties are well  maintained and equipped with modern  machinery.
All locations,  although  highly  utilized,  have the ability to expand as sales
requirements justify. Because of the seasonal production cycles the exact extent
of utilization is difficult to measure. In certain circumstances the theoretical
full efficiency  levels are being reached;  however,  expansion of the number of
production days or hours could increase the output by up to 20% for a season.

Certain of the Company's  facilities are mortgaged to financial  institutions to
secure long-term debt and capital lease  obligations.  See Notes 4 and 5 of Item
8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about
the Company's long-term debt and lease commitments.

                                Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary  course of its business,  the Company is made a party to certain
legal proceedings seeking monetary damages. The Company does not believe that an
adverse  decision  in any of these  proceedings  would have a  material  adverse
impact on the Company.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
                                   Operations

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Because of the food  processing  segment,  the Company's  yearly  business cycle
shows large  inventory  growth  during the summer and fall harvest  period.  The
inventory  peaks in the early winter and drops to its minimum level  immediately
prior to the next  pack  season.  These  peaks  are  financed  through  seasonal
borrowings whose high and low points essentially  correspond with the changes in
inventory, or by a reduction in short-term investments.  Accordingly,  inventory
management is key to liquidity.

During May 1996 the  Company  sold its  investment  in Moog Inc.  Class A Common
Stock back to Moog.  This sale  generated  cash  proceeds of $12.9 million and a
pre-tax gain of $7.5  million.  During  August 1996 the Company sold its Clifton
Park,  New York facility for cash resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.6 million
and a gain of $1.6 million  before  income tax  expense.  The Company had leased
this facility to a third party.

During September 1995 the Company entered into a sale and leaseback  transaction
whereby  three of its  wastewater  facilities in New York State were sold to the
Wayne County Water and Sewer Authority for net proceeds of $9.3 million.

During 1995 the Company  acquired  certain assets of the Green Giant Division of
The Pillsbury Company. Under an Alliance Agreement concurrently executed in 1995
by  the  Company,  Pillsbury  and  Grand  Metropolitan  Incorporated,  Pillsbury
continues to be responsible for all of the sales, marketing and customer service
functions  for the Green Giant brand,  while the Company  will handle  vegetable
processing and canning operations.  Pillsbury continues to own all the trademark
rights to the Green Giant brand and its proprietary  seed varieties.  The assets
acquired   included  certain  raw  material  and  supplies   inventory  and  six
manufacturing  facilities  located in the  Midwestern  and  Northwestern  United
States.  The purchase price of $86.1 million was funded by a  subordinated  note
issued by the  Company  for $73.0  million  and the  balance  was  funded out of
working  capital.  This  subordinated  note  decreased $6.0 million in 1996 as a
result of an  agreement  reached  with  Pillsbury  to convert that amount to the
Company's Class A Common Stock. Such conversion was completed in March 1996. The
subordinated  note  increased  by $7.6  million in 1997 due to the  addition  of
capital  projects  that  Pillsbury  has  completed  and  green  bean  processing
equipment acquired from Pillsbury, which was transferred to the Company.

In  conjunction  with this  acquisition,  the Company  entered  into a revolving
credit  facility for up to $150.0 million (now $130.0  million) from a syndicate
of eleven (now eight) banks. In addition, the Company issued two new senior debt
notes.  The first was a $75.0 million  unsecured  note issued to The  Prudential
Insurance  Company of America,  with  repayment  due  beginning in March 1998, a
final  maturity  date of  February  2005,  and an  interest  rate of 10.78% (see
Long-Term Debt, note 4). The second was a $50.0 million unsecured note issued to
John Hancock  Mutual Life  Insurance  Company,  with  repayment due beginning in
March 2001, a final  maturity of January  2009,  and an interest rate of 10.81%.
The  proceeds  of these two notes  were used to  finance  or  replenish  working
capital for the following:  1) capital  expenditures of $50.0 million related to
the  Alliance  Agreement  with  Pillsbury;  2)  repayment  of two  notes  due an
insurance company,  one repaid in July 1994 for $13.8 million,  the other repaid
when the new debt was issued for $26.6 million; 3) three small acquisitions made
over the previous  fifteen months  totaling  $15.6 million;  and 4) the balance,
$19.0 million, for capital expenditures made over the previous three years.

As mentioned above,  during 1995 the Company entered into an unsecured revolving
credit agreement for up to $150.0 million (now $130.0 million).  Previously, the
Company  maintained  uncommitted  lines of  credit.  Credit  lines  provide  for
interest rate options based on Prime,  Eurodollar,  or Money Market.  There were
$62.3  million of borrowings  outstanding  under these lines at the end of 1998,
$18.0 million at the end of 1997, and $113.0 million at the end of 1996.

The decrease in cash and short-term  investments of $22.5 million over the three
year period ended in 1998 was  primarily  due to Aunt Nellie's Farm Kitchens and
Curtice Burns acquisitions of $53.7 million,  the debt repayments totaling $14.9
million;  capital additions of $15.7 million,  $11.7 million, and $67.9 million,
in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. This was partially offset by the proceeds
of the new long-term debt issues totaling $25.7 million;  proceeds from the sale
of Moog  Inc.  stock of $12.9  million;  proceeds  from the  disposal  of assets
totaling $13.5 million;  and net earnings (before  depreciation  effect which is
non-cash).

In 1998 accounts  receivable  increased by $12.2 million to $48.6 million.  This
was due in part to  Non-Alliance  sales being $87.7 million higher fueled by the
two acquisitions (see below).

In 1998  inventories  increased $35.8 million over 1997. This was largely due to
the acquisitions made during the year (see below). In 1997 inventories  declined
by $71.6 million due to the sales increase on Alliance sales.

In 1998 capital  expenditures were $15.7 million as compared to $11.7 million in
1997.  In 1998 certain  juice  production  lines were  converted to PET (plastic
bottles)  totaling  $3.2  million at plants in the south and  midwest.  The 1997
capital  expenditures are down  substantially from 1996. The largest project was
the green  bean  expansion  in  Cumberland  related to the  Alliance  where $4.4
million was spent in 1997.  The 1996 capital  expenditures  of $67.9 million are
substantially  due to a  major  capital  expansion  relating  to  the  Alliance,
integrated  six of  Pillsbury's  Green  Giant  vegetable  processing  plants and
significantly increased the Company's own production capabilities to accommodate
the  production of four Pillsbury  plants that were  concurrently  closed.  This
capital expansion was originally  expected to be $50.0 million,  but to meet our
ambitious  goals,  an  additional  $25.0  million  was  spent  on this  project,
primarily in our New York State operations in order to meet operational needs of
the Alliance.

In 1998 the Company completed two  acquisitions.  The first acquisition was Aunt
Nellie's Farm Kitchens,  which produces,  markets, and sells fruit and vegetable
products from their plants in the midwest,  for approximately $24.3 million. The
second  acquisition  was the Curtice  Burns  canned  branded  and private  label
vegetable business for approximately $29.4 million (see Acquisitions, note 10).

Results of Operations

Net sales for 1998 were $703.2 million, which includes $277.1 million sold under
the  Alliance  with  Pillsbury.  Net sales for 1997 were $730.1  million,  which
includes  $391.7 million sold under the Alliance with  Pillsbury.  Net sales for
1996 were $508.0  million,  which includes  $168.0 million of sales to Pillsbury
under the Alliance.  In 1998  Non-Alliance  sales increase by $87.7 million.  In
1997  Non-Alliance  sales  decreased  by $1.6  million.  If 1996 net  sales  are
compared  with the last full year sales  (1994),  the  increase for the two year
period is 22.7%  excluding the effect of the Alliance.  In 1998  vegetable  unit
sales increased due to the two acquisitions and the high pack levels of the last
two years.  Also in 1998 juice dollar sales  declined  $12.8 million or 7.8%. In
1997 vegetable  unit sales  increased due to getting higher packs than the prior
year. In 1997 vegetable unit prices  increased for part of the year but declined
later in the year due to excess  inventories.  In 1996 vegetable unit sales were
lower due to a less than budget pack.  Unit vegetable  selling prices dropped in
1996,  while apple  pricing  rose due to the  worldwide  shortage of  processing
apples.

The 1997 results  include a $7.5  million gain on the sale of Moog Inc.  Class A
Common  Stock  back to Moog and a gain on the sale of a Clifton  Park,  New York
warehouse of $1.6 million.  The 1996 results include a  non-recurring  charge of
$15.1 million, before income tax benefit, due to a combination of start-up costs
related to the  Pillsbury  Alliance and severe  drought  conditions  in New York
State throughout the entire summer.  The Company  undertook an ambitious capital
expenditure program related to the Pillsbury  Alliance.  In the relatively short
time  between  the  February  1995  closing of the  Pillsbury  Alliance  and the
beginning of the 1995 vegetable pack, 37 separate major capital  projects needed
to be completed.  There were some unforeseen  problems related to a few of these
projects,  mostly in the New York plants. Some of the used equipment transferred
from the closed  plants had  operating  difficulties  and were not always easily
repaired,  thus causing  downtime.  Therefore,  plant throughput and yields were
poor at some  plants  resulting  in  unfavorable  manufacturing  variances.  The
problems were magnified when the drought and the hot weather  conditions  forced
the uneven timing of maturities of vegetables.

In 1998 earnings decreased for the following reasons: 1) lower selling prices on
vegetables  due to an  ongoing  industry  oversupply  due in part to the  second
consecutive above budget pack, 2) apple product price declines were greater than
apple  product  cost  declines,  and 3) a decline in the  consumption  of frozen
concentrates put further pressure on pricing. In 1997 earnings increased for the
following  reasons:  1) the Moog gain of $7.5 million  detailed above, 2) higher
vegetable  selling  prices for part of the year,  and 3) greater sales under the
Alliance agreement produced additional earnings.  In 1996 earnings decreased for
the following reasons: 1) the $15.1 million non-recurring charge detailed above,
2) higher apple cost of product sold due to a world-wide  shortage of processing
apples,  and 3) lower selling  prices on vegetables  due to an ongoing  industry
oversupply.

In 1996, the Company  changed its inventory  valuation  method from the lower of
cost; last-in,  first-out; or market to the lower of cost; first-in,  first-out;
or market.  The major reason for the change is the Alliance  inventories  are on
the  first-in,  first-out  method which  represent the majority of the Company's
inventory  dollars.  The change has been applied  retroactively by restating the
financial statements of prior years.

In general,  inflation played a relatively  small role in the operating  results
and cash flows of 1998,  1997, and 1996 since the Company  depreciates its fixed
assets under accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Three new accounting standards were issued during the past year that the Company
must  comply  with  beginning  in 1999.  They are 1) SFAS  No.  130,  "Reporting
Comprehensive  Income",  2) SFAS No.  131,  "Disclosures  about  Segments  of an
Enterprise  and  Related   Information",   and  3)  SFAS  No.  132,  "Employers'
Disclosures about Pensions and Other  Postretirement  Benefits." These standards
expand or modify current  disclosures and,  accordingly,  will have no impact on
the Company's reported financial position,  results of operations and cash flows
(see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, note 1).

Year 2000

The Company  recognizes the need to ensure its operations  will not be adversely
impacted by Year 2000  software  failures.  Software  failures due to processing
errors  potentially  arising  from  calculations  using the Year 2000 date are a
known risk. The Company is in the process of replacing  some systems,  which are
known  not to be Year  2000  compliant,  and  updating  others  to be Year  2000
compliant.  The Company is addressing the computing  environment  along with any
other  systems  in the  operating  facilities,  which  may also not be Year 2000
compliant.  The Company is using  internal  resources  to make systems Year 2000
compliant as much as possible  only using  external  resources  for  specialized
equipment,  which is mostly at our plants.  The total cost of compliance,  above
and beyond normal software upgrades, is not expected to exceed $750,000.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Seneca Foods Corporation and Subsidiaries

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations - The Company conducts its business almost entirely in food
processing,  operating 32 plants and  warehouses  in eight  states.  The Company
markets  branded and  private  label  processed  foods to retail  customers  and
institutional food distributors.

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts for the parent Company and all of its wholly-owned  subsidiaries  after
elimination of intercompany transactions, profits, and balances.

Revenue  Recognition  - Sales and related  cost of product  sold are  recognized
primarily upon shipment of products. When customers, under the terms of specific
orders,  request  that the Company  invoice  goods and hold the goods for future
shipment,  the Company recognizes revenue when legal title to the finished goods
inventory passes to the purchaser.  Generally the Company receives cash from the
purchaser when legal title passes.

Concentration of Credit Risk - Financial  instruments  that potentially  subject
the Company to credit risk  consist of trade  receivables  and  interest-bearing
investments.  With the exception of the relationship  with Pillsbury,  wholesale
and  retail  food  distributors  comprise  a  significant  portion  of the trade
receivables;   collateral  is  not  required.   The  risk  associated  with  the
concentration  is limited due to the large number of  wholesalers  and retailers
and their  geographic  dispersion.  The  Company  places  substantially  all its
interest-bearing  investments  with financial  institutions  and monitors credit
exposure.

Cash and  Short-Term  Investments  - The  Company  considers  all highly  liquid
instruments  purchased  with a maturity  of three  months or less as  short-term
investments.

Inventories  -  Inventories  are  stated at lower of cost;  first-in,  first-out
(FIFO); or market.

Income Taxes - The provision for income taxes  includes  federal,  foreign,  and
state income taxes  currently  payable and those  deferred  because of temporary
differences  between  the  financial  statement  and tax  bases  of  assets  and
liabilities.

Earnings per Common Share - Basic earnings per share are calculated on the basis
of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 128, "Earnings per
Share," which the Company  adopted in the fourth  quarter of 1998.  Earnings per
common  share  amounts of all prior  years have been  restated.  The  additional
shares and dividends were not considered in the diluted  calculation below since
diluting a loss is not allowed under SFAS No. 128.

A  reconciliation  of basic  earnings per share with diluted  earnings per share
follows:

Depreciation - Property,  plant, and equipment is stated at cost or, in the case
of capital  leases,  the present value of future lease  payments.  For financial
reporting,  the Company provides for depreciation and capital lease amortization
on the  straight-line  method at rates based upon the estimated  useful lives of
the various assets.  Impairment losses are recognized when the carrying value of
an asset  exceeds its fair  value.  The Company  regularly  assesses  all of its
long-lived  assets for impairment and determined that no impairment loss need be
recognized in 1998 and 1997.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amount of assets and  liabilities  and the  disclosure of contingent  assets and
liabilities  at the date of the  financial  statements,  as well as the  related
revenues and expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual amounts could differ
from those estimated.

New Accounting Pronouncements:  In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income" and SFAS No. 131,
"Disclosures  about  Segments  of an  Enterprise  and Related  Information."  In
February 1998, SFAS No. 132,  "Employers'  Disclosures  about Pensions and Other
Postretirement  Benefits"  was issued.  SFAS No. 130  establishes  standards for
reporting and display of comprehensive  income and its components.  SFAS No. 131
establishes  standards for reporting  information  about operating  segments and
related  disclosures  about  products and services,  geographic  areas and major
customers.  SFAS No. 132 revises current disclosure  requirements for employers'
pensions and other  retiree  benefits.  These  standards  are  effective for the
Company during 1999. These standards  expand or modify current  disclosures and,
accordingly,  will have no impact on the Company's reported financial  position,
results of  operations  and cash flows.  The Company is assessing  the impact of
these standards.

Reclassifications  - Certain previously  reported amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current period classification.

2.  Common Stock of Moog Inc.

Other assets  includes the  Company's  investment in the Class B Common Stock of
Moog Inc., which is carried at fair value. There was a realized gain on the sale
of Class A Common Stocks of Moog Inc. of $7,501,000 before income taxes in 1997.
There were no realized  gains or losses in 1998 and 1996,  and gross  unrealized
holding gains were $1,604,000,  $695,000 and $7,832,000, at March 31, 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively.

3.  Lines of Credit

The Company obtains required short-term funds through bank borrowings.  At March
31, 1998,  the Company had $3,835,963  outstanding  for letters of credit and an
unsecured revolving line of credit totaling $130,000,000.  The line is renewable
in 1999 and provides for loans of varying  maturities  at rate options  based on
Prime,  Eurodollar,  or Money Market.  This  unsecured  revolving line of credit
provides for various financial covenants. The Company was not in compliance with
certain of these financial  covenants at March 31, 1998 and is in the process of
obtaining waivers from the lending institutions.

As of March 31, 1998 and 1997, the amounts  borrowed under the revolving line of
credit were  $62,270,000 and  $18,000,000,  respectively.  The weighted  average
interest rate on the amounts borrowed during these periods were 7.88% and 7.94%,
respectively.

Certain  debt  agreements  provide  various  financial   covenants  including  a
provision  that the  Company may pay  dividends  on any class of stock only from
consolidated  net earnings  available for  distribution.  There were no earnings
available  for  distribution  as of  March  31,  1998.  The  Company  was not in
compliance  with certain of these financial  covenants  relating to a portion of
its  Long-Term  Debt at March 31, 1998. On June 16, 1998,  the Company  obtained
unconditional  waivers from the lending institutions.  In addition,  the lending
institutions have amended, or in one instance, agreed to amend certain financial
covenants for 1999 based on the Company's projections,  which, if achieved, will
permit the Company to be in compliance.

The Company has four  Industrial  Revenue Bonds ("IRB's")  totaling  $22,630,000
which are backed by direct pay letters of credit.

Debt repayment requirements for the next five fiscal years are:

5.  Leases

The Company leases a portion of its equipment and buildings.  Capitalized leases
consist  primarily of industrial  development  agency financing  instruments and
limited obligation special revenue bonds which bear interest rates from 3.55% to
6.75%. Other leases include non-cancelable  operating leases expiring at various
dates through 2007.

During 1996, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback  transaction  whereby
three of its  wastewater  facilities in New York State were sold for  $9,258,000
and leased back under a 20-year lease  agreement.  This  transaction  produced a
gain of $4,178,000,  which was deferred and is being  amortized over the 20-year
lease period.

Leased assets under capital leases consist of the following:

                                                         1998              1997

The  Company  has a Federal  regular  tax net  operating  loss  carryforward  of
$6,939,000, expiring March 31, 2013, which is available to offset future taxable
income.  State net operating loss  carryforwards of  approximately  $21,000,000,

7.  Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock - The outstanding 10% cumulative,  convertible, voting preferred
stock consists of 407,240 Series A shares, convertible at the rate of one common
share of Class A and Class B for every  twenty  preferred  shares,  and  400,000
Series B shares,  which carry a one for thirty conversion rate. The Series A and
B shares have a $.25  stated  value and a $.025 par value.  There are  2,600,000
shares  authorized  of Class A $.025 par value  stock  which  are  unissued  and
undesignated. In addition there are 30,000 shares of no par stock which are also
unissued and undesignated.

Common  Stock -  During  1996  an  amendment  to the  Company's  Certificate  of
Incorporation,  which effected a  recapitalization  of the Company by creating a
second class of common stock (which was  distributed to all common  shareholders
as a stock split in the form of a dividend),  was adopted. This recapitalization
amendment (i)  reclassified  the existing  Common Stock as Class B Common Stock,
(ii)  authorized a new class of 10,000,000  shares  designated as Class A Common
Stock and (iii)  established  the express  terms of the Class A Common Stock and
the Class B Common Stock.  The Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock
have   substantially   identical   rights  with  respect  to  any  dividends  or
distributions  of cash or property  declared on shares of common  stock and rank
equally as to the right to receive proceeds on liquidation or dissolution of the
Company after payment of the Company's indebtedness and liquidation right to the
holders of preferred shares.  However,  holders of Class B Common Stock retain a
full vote per share  whereas  the  holders of Class A Common  Stock have  voting
rights of 1/20th of one vote per share on all  matters as to which  shareholders
of the Company are entitled to vote.

In 1996, the Company  reached an agreement with Pillsbury to convert  $6,000,000
of its  subordinated  note into 346,570  shares of the Company's  Class A Common
Stock.

Unissued  shares of common stock reserved for conversion  privileges were 33,695
of Class A and Class B at March 31, 1998 and 1997.

     rates  offered to the Company for debt with the same maturities.

     Notes  payable - The  carrying  amount  approximates  fair value due to the
     short-term maturity of these instruments.

     Class B Common Stock of Moog Inc. - Based on quoted market prices.

10. Acquisitions

In 1998 the Company completed two acquisitions. The first was the acquisition of
Aunt  Nellie's Farm Kitchen from The  Pillsbury  Company,  a subsidiary of Grand
Metropolitan  Incorporated,  for approximately  $24 million.  Aunt Nellie's Farm
Kitchen produces, markets, and sells fruit and vegetable products from plants in
the Midwest and its sales were approximately $50 million.  The Company purchased
the plants,  inventories,  accounts receivable,  and trademarks of the business.
This acquisition was funded primarily out of working capital.

The second  acquisition was the Comstock canned private label vegetable business
from Curtice Burns Foods,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Pro-Fac  Cooperative,
along with the Blue Boy branded canned vegetable business. The Company purchased
two New York plants, related inventories,  and certain trademarks. The companies
also  formed  a  long-term   strategic   alliance,   combining  their  New  York
agricultural departments into one organization. The sales were approximately $40
million.  The purchase  price was  approximately  $29 million,  which was funded
primarily out of working capital.

Both acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method and, accordingly,
the  operating  results of the  acquired  businesses  have been  included in the
consolidated operating results since the dates of acquisition.  The following is
a summary of proforma results as if the acquisitions  were made at the beginning
of the periods presented:


                                                1998                1997
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       (Unaudited)
                                        (In thousands except per share amounts)

Net sales                                   $710,137            $829,870

Net earnings (loss)                           (5,150)              4,533

Basic earnings (loss) per common share          (.88)                .76

11.  Other Income

Other income in 1997  consisted of the  following:  1) a gain on the sale of the
Moog,  Inc.  common  stock of  $7,501,000,  2) a gain on the sale of the Clifton
Park, New York warehouse of $1,640,000, and 3) a loss on the sale of Eau Claire,
Michigan plant of $833,000.

Other  income  in  1996  consisted  of the  gain  on the  sale  of the  Peabody,
Massachusetts warehouse totaling $4,271,000.

12.  Non-Recurring Charge

The 1996 operating results include a non-recurring charge of $15,078,000, before
income tax  benefit,  due to a  combination  of  start-up  costs  related to the
Pillsbury  Alliance and severe drought  conditions in New York State  throughout
the entire  summer.  The Company  undertook  an  ambitious  capital  expenditure
program related to the Pillsbury Alliance.  In the relatively short time between
the February  1995 closing of the  Pillsbury  Alliance and the  beginning of the
1995 vegetable pack, 37 separate major capital  projects needed to be completed.
There were some unforeseen  problems related to a few of these projects,  mostly
in the New York plants.  Some of the used equipment  transferred from the closed
plants had  operating  difficulties  and were not always easily  repaired,  thus
causing  downtime.  Throughput and yields were poor at some plants  resulting in
unfavorable  manufacturing  variances.  The  problems  were  magnified  when the
drought and the hot weather conditions forced the uneven timing of maturities of
vegetables.

13.  Sales Information

The  Company  has an  Alliance  Agreement  with  Pillsbury  whereby  the Company
processes canned and frozen vegetables for Pillsbury under the Green Giant brand
name. Pillsbury continues to be responsible for all of the sales,  marketing and
customer service  functions for the Green Giant products.  During 1998, 1997 and
1996, the Company sold $48,872,000, $205,633,000 and $167,994,000, respectively,
of canned and frozen vegetables to Pillsbury, which represented 7%, 28% and 33%,
respectively,  of net  sales.  Sales of Green  Giant  vegetables  to  purchasers
unrelated to Pillsbury in 1998 and 1997 were $228,208,000 and  $186,091,000,  or
32% and 26% of net  sales,  respectively.  Total  net  sales in 1998 and 1997 of
Green Giant vegetables were $277,080,000 and $391,724,000, or 40% and 54% of net
sales, respectively.

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Seneca Foods
Corporation  and  subsidiaries  as of March 31,  1998 and 1997,  and the related
consolidated  statements of net earnings,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1998.  These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of Seneca  Foods  Corporation  and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for each of the three  years in the period  ended March 31,

earnings  available  for  distribution,  which  were none as of March 31,  1998.
Payment of dividends to common  stockholders  is made at the  discretion  of the
Company's  Board of Directors  and depends,  among other  factors,  on earnings,
capital  requirements,  operating  and financial  condition of the Company.  The
Company has not declared or paid a common dividend in many years.

</TABLE>

Earnings  for the fourth  quarter have  historically  reflected  adjustments  of
previously  estimated  raw  material  costs and  production  levels.  Due to the
dependence  on fruit and  vegetable  yields  of the  Company's  food  processing
segment, interim costing must be estimated.
