                         General Development of Business

SENECA FOODS  CORPORATION (the "Company") was organized in 1949 and incorporated
under the laws of the  State of New York.  In the  spring of 1995,  the  Company
began operations under its Alliance Agreement with The Pillsbury Company,  which
created the Company's most significant business relationship. Under the Alliance
Agreement,  the  Company  has  packed  canned  and  frozen  vegetables  carrying
Pillsbury's  Green  Giant brand name.  These  Green Giant  vegetables  have been
produced in vegetable plants which the Company acquired from Pillsbury and, to a
lesser  extent,  in the Company's  other  vegetable  plants,  which also produce
vegetables under the Libby's brand name,  which is licensed to the Company,  and
other brand names owned by the Company or its customers.

Since the onset of the Alliance  Agreement,  vegetable  production  has been the
Company's dominant line of business. In the most recent fiscal year, the Company
successively  sold its fruit juice  business and its  applesauce  and industrial
flavors business.  As a result of these fiscal 1999 divestitures,  the Company's
only  non-vegetable  food products are specialty  cherry  products and a line of
fruit chips.

                  Financial Information about Industry Segments

The Company's  business  activities are conducted in food and non-food segments.
Giving  effect to the 1999  divestitures,  the food segment  constitutes  99% of
total sales, of which approximately 96% is vegetable  processing and 3% is fruit
processing.  The non-food segment is an air charter service, which represents 1%
of the Company's business.  Consequently,  the financial  information related to
segments is not material.

                        Narrative Description of Business

                         Principal Products and Markets

Food Processing

The  principal  products  of  this  segment  include  canned  vegetable,  frozen
vegetable and fruit products.  The products are sold to retail and institutional
markets.  The Company has  divided the United  States into four major  marketing
sections:   Eastern,  Southern,   Northwestern,   and  Southwestern.   Vegetable
operations are primarily  supported by plant  locations in New York,  Wisconsin,
Washington,  Idaho,  and Minnesota.  Plant  locations in Kentucky,  Michigan and
Washington  provide ready access to the domestic  sources of fruit  necessary to
support marketing efforts in their respective sections of the country.

The following table summarizes net sales by major product category for the years
ended March 31,  1999,  1998,  and 1997,  after  eliminating  in each year sales
attributable to the product lines which were sold in the 1999 divestitures:

Seneca Flight Operations provides air charter service primarily to industries in
upstate New York.


                     Source and Availability of Raw Material

Food Processing

The Company's food processing  plants are located in major  vegetable  producing
states.  Fruits and vegetables  are primarily  obtained  through  contracts with
growers. The Company's sources of supply are considered equal or superior to its
competition for all of its food products.


                                Seasonal Business

Food Processing

While  individual  fruits and vegetables have seasonal cycles of peak production
and sales,  the  different  cycles are usually  offsetting  to some extent.  The
supply of  commodities,  current  pricing,  and expected  new crop  quantity and
quality  affect the timing of the Company's  sales and  earnings.  An Off Season
Allowance  is  established  during the year to  minimize  the effect of seasonal
production on earnings.  Off Season Allowance is zero at fiscal year-end.


                                     Backlog

Food Processing

In the food  processing  business,  the end of year sales  order  backlog is not
considered  meaningful.   Traditionally,   larger  customers  provide  tentative
bookings for their expected  purchases for the upcoming  season.  These bookings
are further  developed  as data on the  expected  size of the  related  national
harvests  becomes  available.  In general,  these bookings serve as a yardstick,
rather than a firm  commitment,  since actual  harvest  results can vary notably
from early estimates.  In actual practice,  the Company has substantially all of
its expected  seasonal  production  identified to potential sales outlets before
the seasonal production is completed.


                            Competition and Customers

Food Processing

Competition  in  the  food  business  is  substantial  with  imaginative   brand
registration,  quality service,  and pricing being the major determinants in the
Company's relative market position.

All of the Company's  products compete with those of other national,  major, and
smaller regional food processing companies under highly competitive  conditions.
The Company's  major  competitors in the vegetable  business have  substantially
greater  sales and assets than the  Company.  The Company  also sells  vegetable
products which compete with Pillsbury products manufactured by the Company under
the Alliance Agreement.


<PAGE>



The vegetable business in the last three years has undergone  consolidation as a
result of adverse market conditions,  and many smaller vegetable processors have
been acquired by the Company and its major competitors.  Future acquisitions may
increase the market strength of the Company's larger competitors  providing them
with even greater resources for obtaining  desirable shelf space and promotional
programs  with major  retail  food  stores.  However,  the major  segment of the
Company's  business is producing  vegetables  for sale by others - such as Green
Giant  vegetables for Pillsbury and  vegetables  carrying the brand names of the
Company's  grocery  chain  customers.  In  that  segment  of the  business,  the
marketing programs are determined by the Company's  customers.  In recent years,
many  major  retail  food  stores  have been  increasing  their  promotions  and
offerings  of their own brand name  vegetables,  to the  detriment  of vegetable
brands owned by the producers, including the Company's own brands.

During the past year  approximately  9% of the  Company's  processed  foods were
packed for retail customers under the Company branded labels of Libby's(R), Blue
Boy(R), Aunt Nellie's Farm Kitchen(R), and Seneca(R). About 12% of the processed
foods were packed for institutional food distributors and 28% of processed foods
were retail packed under the private  label of  customers.  The remaining 51% is
sold  under  the  Alliance  Agreement  with  Pillsbury  (see  note 13 of Item 8,
Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data).  Termination  of the  Alliance
Agreement would have a material  adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.
The  customers  represent  a full cross  section of the  retail,  institutional,
distributor,  and  industrial  markets and the Company does not consider  itself
dependent  on any single  sales  source  other than  sales  attributable  to the
Alliance Agreement.

The Company's  principal branded products are Libby's canned  vegetables,  which
rank among the top five national brands in sales volume.  The information  under
the heading  Liquidity  and Capital  Resources in  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations  in the 1999 Annual
Report is incorporated by reference.

                            Environmental Protection

Environmental  protection is an area that has been worked on most  diligently at
each food processing facility.  In all locations the Company has cooperated with
federal, state, and local environmental protection authorities in developing and
maintaining suitable  antipollution  facilities.  In general,  pollution control
facilities are equal to or somewhat superior to those of our competitors and are
within  environmental  protection  standards.  The  Company  does not expect any
material capital  expenditures to comply with  environmental  regulations in the
near  future.  The Company is a  potentially  responsible  party with respect to
three waste disposal sites,  owned and operated by others,  but the Company does
not believe the aggregate liability is material.

The Company  has six  collective  bargaining  agreements  with six union  locals
covering  approximately  536 of its  full  time  employees.  The  terms of these
agreements  result in wages and benefits,  which are  substantially the same for
comparable  positions  for the Company's  non-union  employees.  Two  collective
bargaining  agreements expire in calendar 1999. The remaining  agreements expire
in calendar 2000, 2001, and 2002.


                               Foreign Operations

Export sales for the Company are a relatively  small  portion  (about 2%) of the
food processing sales.

                                     Item 2

                                   Properties

The Company owns seven food processing,  packaging,  and warehousing  facilities
located in New York State that provide  approximately  1,867,000  square feet of
food packaging, freezing and freezer storage, and warehouse storage space. These
facilities process and package vegetable products. The Company is a lessee under
a number of operating  and capital  leases for  equipment and real property used
for processing and warehousing.

Five  facilities in  Minnesota,  one facility in Michigan,  three  facilities in
Washington,  one facility in Idaho, one facility in Kentucky, and six facilities
in Wisconsin  provide  approximately  5,294,000  square feet of food  packaging,
freezing and freezer  storage,  and warehouse  storage space.  These  facilities
process and package  various  vegetable and fruit  products.  The facilities are
owned by the Company.

The  Company  owns one food  distribution  facility  in  Massachusetts  totaling
approximately  59,000 square feet which is leased out to another company through
2004.  Sublease  income of $271,000  was  received on this  facility  during the
period. In addition the air charter division has a 14,000 square foot facility.

All of the  properties are well  maintained  and the  production  facilities are
equipped with modern machinery.  All locations,  although highly utilized,  have
the ability to expand as sales  requirements  justify.  Because of the  seasonal
production  cycles the exact extent of utilization  is difficult to measure.  In
certain  circumstances the theoretical full efficiency levels are being reached;
however,  expansion of the number of production days or hours could increase the

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Because the Company is primarily engaged in vegetable processing,  the Company's
yearly  business cycle shows large  inventory  growth during the summer and fall
harvest  period.  The inventory peaks in the early fall and drops to its minimum
level  immediately  prior to the next pack  season  (pack  refers to canning and
freezing of vegetables  and certain fruits with each commodity at a certain time
during  the  year,  which  can vary  based on  weather  conditions  among  other
factors).  These peaks are financed through  seasonal  borrowings whose high and
low  points  essentially  correspond  with the  changes  in  inventory,  or by a
reduction in short-term investments. Accordingly, inventory management is key to
liquidity.

During  September 1998, the Company  completed an equity sale,  which raised $50
million.  The equity sale consisted of a Rights Offering to the Company's common
shareholders and a Stock Purchase Agreement with certain investors.

In December 1998,  the Company sold a significant  portion of its Juice Division
to Northland Cranberries, Inc., together with an exclusive license to market and
sell Seneca juice  products,  for $28.2  million in cash plus the  assumption of
certain  liabilities.  This sale included plants in Dundee,  New York;  Mountain
Home, North Carolina;  Jackson,  Wisconsin; a warehouse in Eau Claire, Michigan;
and a receiving station in Portland, New York.

In January 1999, the Company sold to Tree Top, Inc. its  processing  facility in
Prosser,  Washington  together with its non-branded  specialty fruit concentrate
business and an exclusive license to market and sell Seneca applesauce. Tree Top
paid approximately $29.0 million in cash.

As a result of the  fiscal  1999  divestitures  and  equity  sale,  the  Company
anticipates  that  its  requirements  for  working  capital  financing  will  be
substantially  reduced in the fiscal year  ending  March 31, 2000 as compared to
the prior  fiscal  year.  Accordingly,  the total  financing  commitment  of the
Company's  line of credit  banks  was  reduced  in a series  of steps  from $130
million to $75 million.  On January 29, 1999,  the Company  elected to terminate
its Amended and Restated  Credit  Agreement  with those  banks.  As of March 31,
1999,  the Company has obtained a line of credit  commitment of $20 million from
one of its former  lending banks and $30 million of  uncommitted  line of credit
financing from two other banks, which were also in the former lending group. The
new credit  arrangements  with the three banks do not require the Company to pay
any commitment fees, whereas the Company paid fees for the unused portion of the
bank  commitments  under the Amended and  Restated  Credit  Agreement,  which it
terminated in January 1999.

The  Company  believes  that  the  credit  facilities  described  above  will be
sufficient,  with its  other  resources,  for its  anticipated  working  capital
requirements in 2000.

In the final  quarter of 1999,  the Company made the  following  prepayments  on
long-term debt (plus  prepayment  penalty  payments to the lenders in accordance
with the terms of the indebtedness):

         (1)      With  respect  to its  outstanding  10.78%  Series  A Note due
                  February 23, 2005, in addition to the  scheduled  payment of a
                  principal installment of $7,500,000 due February 23, 1999, the
                  Company   prepaid  two  annual   principal   installments   of
                  $8,400,000 each due February 23 in 2000 and 2001; and

         (2)      With respect to its  outstanding  9.17% Senior Notes due 2004,
                  the  Company   prepaid  $15,000,000,  the  entire  outstanding
                  principal amount of these Notes.

During May 1996,  the Company sold its  investment  in Moog Inc.  Class A Common
Stock back to Moog.  This sale  generated  cash  proceeds of $12.9 million and a
pre-tax gain of $7.5  million.  During  August 1996 the Company sold its Clifton
Park,  New York facility for cash resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.6 million
and a gain of $1.6 million  before  income tax  expense.  The Company had leased
this facility to a third party.

During 1995, the Company  acquired certain assets of the Green Giant Division of
The Pillsbury Company. Under an Alliance Agreement concurrently executed in 1995
by  the  Company,  Pillsbury  and  Grand  Metropolitan  Incorporated,  Pillsbury
continues to be responsible for all of the sales, marketing and customer service
functions  for the Green Giant brand,  while the Company  will handle  vegetable
processing and canning operations.  Pillsbury continues to own all the trademark
rights to the Green Giant brand and its proprietary  seed varieties.  The assets
acquired   included  certain  raw  material  and  supplies   inventory  and  six
manufacturing  facilities  located in the  Midwestern  and  Northwestern  United
States.  The purchase price of $86.1 million was funded by a  subordinated  note
issued by the  Company  for $73.0  million  and the  balance  was  funded out of
working  capital.  This  subordinated  note  decreased $6.0 million in 1996 as a
result of an  agreement  reached  with  Pillsbury  to convert that amount to the
Company's Class A Common Stock. Such conversion was completed in March 1996. The
subordinated  note  increased  by $7.6  million in 1997 due to the  addition  of
capital  projects  that  Pillsbury  has  completed  and  green  bean  processing
equipment acquired from Pillsbury, which was transferred to the Company.

The increase in cash and short-term  investments of $25.6 million over the three
year period ended in 1999 was primarily due to: the inventory reduction of $71.7
million;  the proceeds of the sale of assets (primarily the Juice sale) totaling
$69.9  million;  proceeds  from the new  equity  issue  from the Stock  Purchase
Agreement  and Rights  Offering  totaling  $49.7  million;  proceeds  of the new
long-term debt issues  totaling  $16.4  million;  proceeds from the sale of Moog
Inc. stock of $12.9 million; and net earnings (before depreciation effect, which
is non-cash). This was partially offset by: repayments of notes payable totaling
$113.0 million;  long-term debt repayments totaling $55.2 million; Aunt Nellie's
Farm Kitchens and Curtice Burns acquisitions of $53.7 million; capital additions
of $9.4 million,  $15.7  million,  and $11.7 million,  in 1999,  1998, and 1997,
respectively.

In 1999, accounts receivable  decreased by $12.9 million mainly due to the Juice
divestitures.  In 1998, accounts receivable  increased by $12.2 million to $48.6
million.  This was due in part to Non-Alliance  sales being $87.7 million higher
reflecting the two acquisitions described below.

In  1999,  inventories  decreased  by  $41.4  million  mainly  due to the  Juice
divestitures.  In 1998,  inventories increased $35.8 million over 1997. This was
largely  due to the  acquisitions  made  during the year (see  below).  In 1997,
inventories  declined  by $71.6  million  due to the sales  increase on Alliance
sales.

In 1999, capital  expenditures were $9.4 million as compared to $15.7 million in
1998.  In 1998,  capital  expenditures  were $15.7  million as compared to $11.7
million  in 1997.  No major  capital  expenditures  occurred  in 1999.  In 1998,
certain juice production lines were converted to PET (plastic  bottles) totaling
$3.2 million at plants in the South and Midwest.  The 1997 capital  expenditures
were down  substantially from 1996. The largest project was the Alliance related
green bean plant expansion in Cumberland costing $4.4 million in 1997.

In 1998, the Company completed two acquisitions.  The first acquisition was Aunt
Nellie's Farm Kitchens,  which produces,  markets, and sells fruit and vegetable
products from their plants in the Midwest,  costing approximately $24.3 million.
The second  acquisition  was the Curtice Burns canned  branded and private label
vegetable business costing  approximately $29.4 million (see Acquisitions,  note
10).

Results of Operations

Net sales  from  continuing  operations  for 1999  were  $576.2  million,  which
includes  $289.9 million sold under the Alliance with  Pillsbury.  Net sales for
1998 were $560.5 million,  which includes $277.1 million sold under the Alliance
with Pillsbury.  Net sales for 1997 were $571.0  million,  which includes $391.7
million sold under the Alliance  with  Pillsbury.  In 1999,  Non-Alliance  sales
increased by $2.7 million.  In 1999,  vegetable unit non-branded sales increased
over 1998 due to  increased  distribution  on the west coast and  another  large
pack. In 1998,  vegetable unit sales increased due to the two  acquisitions  and
the high pack  levels  of the last two  years.  In 1997,  vegetable  unit  sales
increased due to getting  higher packs than the prior year.  In 1997,  vegetable
unit prices increased for part of the year but declined later in the year due to
excess inventories.

The sale of the Juice  business to  Northland  Cranberries,  Inc.  resulted in a
pre-tax  gain on the disposal of  $6,760,000,  which was  recognized  during the
Company's  fourth  quarter  ended  March  31,  1999.  The sale of the  Company's
processing  facility  in  Prosser,  Washington  together  with  its  non-branded
specialty  fruit  concentrate  business to Tree Top, Inc.  resulted in a pre-tax
gain on the disposal of $10,427,000,  which was also recognized in the Company's
fourth  quarter.  As a result  of  these  sales,  the  Juice  Business  has been
accounted for as  discontinued  operations in prior periods in the  Consolidated
Statements of Net Earnings.  Net sales for these businesses were $121,290,000 in
1999 and $142,694,000 in 1998.

In March 1999,  the  Company  sold  a  parcel of land in  Rochester,  Minnesota,
which  resulted in a gain of $6.2  million  before income taxes.

The 1997 results  include a $7.5  million gain on the sale of Moog Inc.  Class A
Common  Stock  back to Moog and a gain on the sale of a Clifton  Park,  New York
warehouse of $1.6 million.

In 1999,  earnings  increased due to the following  reasons:  1) the gain on the
sale of land in Rochester, Minnesota of $6.2 million, 2) somewhat better selling
prices on vegetables  after low prices the previous  year,  and 3) a gain on the
sale of an aircraft of $.7  million.  These  gains were  partially  offset by an
impairment  provision on real estate and  equipment of $2.0  million,  which was
established in 1999. 1998 earnings  decreased mainly due to lower selling prices
on vegetables  due to an ongoing  industry  oversupply due in part to the second
consecutive  above budget pack.  In 1997,  earnings  increased for the following
reasons:  1) the Moog gain of $7.5 million  detailed above, 2) higher  vegetable
selling  prices for part of the year,  and 3) greater  sales under the  Alliance
Agreement produced additional earnings.

A  deferred  tax  valuation  allowance  as of March  31,  1999,  was not  deemed
necessary due to the fact that there was positive  evidence that  outweighed the
negative evidence that it was more likely than not that these tax assets will be
realized.  While the Company has suffered losses in two of the last three fiscal
years,  the fiscal  1996 loss was due,  in part,  to an unusual  charge of $15.1
million.  The  Company  does  not  believe  that the  recent  losses  should  be
considered a trend, and that other evidence, including the fact that the Company
has never had a net  operating  loss expire,  should be considered in evaluating
whether a valuation allowance is necessary.

In general,  inflation played a relatively  small role in the operating  results
and cash flows of 1999,  1998, and 1997 since the Company  depreciates its fixed
assets under accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". The Company does
not use  derivative  instruments  nor  does it  engage  in  hedging  activities.
Therefore,  this  standard is not  expected  to have an impact on the  Company's
reported financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Year 2000

The Company  recognizes the need to ensure its operations  will not be adversely
impacted by Year 2000  software  failures.  Software  failures due to processing
errors  potentially  arising  from  calculations  using the Year 2000 date are a
known risk. The Company is in the process of replacing  some systems,  which are
known  not to be Year  2000  compliant,  and  updating  others  to be Year  2000
compliant.  The Company is addressing the computing  environment  along with any
other  systems  in the  operating  facilities,  which  may also not be Year 2000
compliant.  The Company is using  internal  resources  to make systems Year 2000
compliant as much as possible  only using  external  resources  for  specialized
equipment,  which is mostly at our plants.  The total cost of compliance,  above
and beyond normal software upgrades, is not expected to exceed $750,000.

The  Project  includes  the  following   phases:   assessment  of  the  problem,
correction/replacement of systems, testing, vendor assessment and development of
a contingency  plan.  The  identification  of all equipment  with date sensitive
operating controls (including embedded systems) has been completed. An inventory
of our systems assets has also been  completed.  All critical  systems will have
been  replaced  or modified  to be  compliant  by June 30,  1999,  with  testing
complete by September 30, 1999.  The Company has begun  evaluating the potential
impact of Year 2000  problems  in the event that our  external  vendors  are not
adequately prepared.  If necessary,  the Company will secure an alternate supply
for the required  products and/or services.  The Company has not yet developed a
contingency plan but anticipates completion of this phase by July 31, 1999.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Seneca Foods Corporation and Subsidiaries

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations - The Company conducts its business almost entirely in food
processing,  operating 24 plants and  warehouses  in seven  states.  The Company
markets  branded and  private  label  processed  foods to retail  customers  and
institutional food distributors.

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts for the parent Company and all of its wholly-owned  subsidiaries  after
elimination of intercompany transactions, profits, and balances.

Revenue  Recognition  - Sales and related  cost of product  sold are  recognized
primarily upon shipment of products. When customers, under the terms of specific
orders,  request  that the Company  invoice  goods and hold the goods for future
shipment,  the Company recognizes revenue when legal title to the finished goods
inventory passes to the purchaser.  Generally the Company receives cash from the
purchaser when legal title passes.

Concentration of Credit Risk - Financial  instruments  that potentially  subject
the Company to credit risk  consist of trade  receivables  and  interest-bearing
investments.  With the exception of the relationship  with Pillsbury,  wholesale
and  retail  food  distributors  comprise  a  significant  portion  of the trade
receivables;   collateral  is  not  required.   The  risk  associated  with  the
concentration  is limited due to the large number of  wholesalers  and retailers
and their  geographic  dispersion.  The  Company  places  substantially  all its
interest-bearing  investments  with financial  institutions  and monitors credit
exposure. Cash and short-term investments in certain accounts exceed the federal
insured  limit,  however,  the  Company has not  experienced  any losses in such
accounts.

Cash and  Short-Term  Investments  - The  Company  considers  all highly  liquid
instruments  purchased  with a maturity  of three  months or less as  short-term
investments.

Inventories  -  Inventories  are  stated at lower of cost;  first-in,  first-out
(FIFO); or market.

Income Taxes - The provision for income taxes  includes  federal,  foreign,  and
state income taxes  currently  payable and those  deferred  because of temporary
differences  between  the  financial  statement  and tax  bases  of  assets  and
liabilities.

</TABLE>


The  additional  shares and  dividends  were not  considered in the 1998 diluted
calculation since diluting a loss is not allowed.

Depreciation - Property,  plant, and equipment is stated at cost or, in the case
of capital  leases,  the present value of future lease  payments.  For financial
reporting,  the Company provides for depreciation and capital lease amortization
on the  straight-line  method at rates based upon the estimated  useful lives of
the various assets.  Impairment losses are recognized when the carrying value of
an asset  exceeds its fair  value.  The Company  regularly  assesses  all of its
long-lived  assets  for  impairment  and an  impairment  loss  of  approximately
$3,354,000  was  recognized  in 1999 of which  $2,036,000  is  included in Other
Income (see Other Income,  note 11) and  $1,318,000 is included in  discontinued
operations. There was no impairment loss recognized in 1998 or 1997.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amount of assets and  liabilities  and the  disclosure of contingent  assets and
liabilities  at the date of the  financial  statements,  as well as the  related
revenues and expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual amounts could differ
from those estimated.

New Accounting Pronouncements: During fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive
Income",  SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information" and SFAS No. 132, "Employers'  Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement  Benefits".  SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and
display of comprehensive income and its components.  The Company's comprehensive
income   includes  net  earnings  (loss)  and  the  unrealized  gain  (loss)  on
investments.  SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for reporting information about

7.  Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock - During  September  1998, the Company  completed an equity sale
that raised  $49,998,000  before  issuance  costs of $286,000.  This equity sale
consisted of a Rights Offering to the Company's common  shareholders and a Stock
Purchase Agreement with certain investors.  A new class of preferred stock ("New
Preferred Stock") was issued, which is convertible, participating, and has a $12
stated  value,  which is now $11.93  due to issue  costs.  The  Rights  Offering
consisted of a distribution  payable to holders of the Company's  Class A Common
Stock at a rate of 1/2 right for each share held to purchase  the New  Preferred
Stock at $12 per  share.  The  shares of New  Preferred  Stock  are  convertible
immediately  on a  share-for-share  basis into  shares of Class A Common  Stock.
Holders of the Company's common stock acquired 1,146,639 shares of new preferred
stock for a total investment of $13,759,000.  Certain investors acquired a total
of 3,019,895 shares of New Preferred Stock for a total investment of $36,239,000
under  the  Stock  Purchase  Agreement.  There  were no  dividends  on this  New
Preferred Stock.

The outstanding 10% cumulative,  convertible, voting preferred stock consists of
407,240 Series A shares,  convertible at the rate of one common share of Class A
and Class B for every  twenty  preferred  shares,  and 400,000  Series B shares,
which carry a one for thirty  conversion  rate. The Series A and B shares have a
$.025 stated value and a $.025 par value.  There are 2,633,333 shares authorized
of Class A $.025 par  value  stock,  which are  unissued  and  undesignated.  In
addition  there are 30,000  shares of no par stock,  which are also unissued and
undesignated.

Common Stock - In September  1998, an amendment to the Company's  Certificate of
Incorporation,  which created the new class of preferred stock described  above,
increased  the  number  of  authorized  shares  of  Class A  Common  Stock  from
10,000,000 to 20,000,000 shares. The Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common
Stock have  substantially  identical  rights with  respect to any  dividends  or
distributions  of cash or property  declared on shares of common  stock and rank
equally as to the right to receive proceeds on liquidation or dissolution of the
Company after payment of the Company's indebtedness and liquidation right to the
holders of preferred shares.  However,  holders of Class B Common Stock retain a
full vote per share  whereas  the  holders of Class A Common  Stock have  voting
rights of 1/20th of one vote per share on all  matters as to which  shareholders
of the Company are entitled to vote.

Unissued  shares of common stock reserved for conversion  privileges were 33,695
of Class A and Class B at March  31,  1999 and 1998.  Additionally,  there  were
3,885,869 shares of Class A reserved for conversion of the New Preferred Stock.

The prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the average
remaining service period of active  participants.  Gains and losses in excess of
10% of the greater of the benefit  obligation  and the  market-related  value of
assets  are  amortized  over the  average  remaining  service  period  of active
participants.

The assumptions used in the measurement of the Company's benefit  obligation are
shown in the following table:

The Company has an Employees'  Savings Plan (401(k))  covering all employees who
meet certain age entry  requirements  and work a stated  minimum number of hours
per  year.  Participants  may make  contributions  up to the  legal  limit.  The
Company's matching contributions are discretionary.  Costs charged to operations
for the Company's matching  contributions  amounted to $808,000,  $811,000,  and
$211,000 in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

10. Acquisitions

In 1998, the Company completed two  acquisitions.  The first was the acquisition
of Aunt  Nellie's Farm  Kitchens  from The  Pillsbury  Company,  a subsidiary of
Diageo plc, for approximately $24 million. Aunt Nellie's Farm Kitchens produces,
markets,  and sells fruit and vegetable  products from plants in the Midwest and
its sales were  approximately  $50 million.  The Company  purchased  the plants,
inventories,   accounts  receivable,   and  trademarks  of  the  business.  This
acquisition included $16 million of inventory and $8 million of property, plant,
and equipment, and was funded primarily out of working capital.

The second  acquisition was the Comstock canned private label vegetable business
from Curtice Burns Foods,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Pro-Fac  Cooperative,
along with the Blue Boy branded canned vegetable business. The Company purchased
two New York plants, related inventories,  and certain trademarks. The companies
also  formed  a  long-term   strategic   alliance,   combining  their  New  York
agricultural departments into one organization. The sales were approximately $40
million.  The purchase price was approximately  $29 million,  which included $13
million of inventory and $16 million of property,  plant, and equipment, and was
funded primarily out of working capital.

Both acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method and, accordingly,
the  operating  results of the  acquired  businesses  have been  included in the
consolidated  operating results since the dates of acquisition.  The fiscal 1998
results of operations on a proforma basis, assuming the acquisitions occurred at
the beginning of fiscal 1998, do not differ  materially  from the actual results
of operations.

13. Segment Information

The Company  manages its business on the basis of one  reportable  segment - the

entirely  in the United  States.  The Company  has an  Alliance  Agreement  with
Pillsbury  whereby  the  Company  processes  canned  and frozen  vegetables  for
Pillsbury  under  the  Green  Giant  brand  name.   Pillsbury  continues  to  be
responsible for all of the sales, marketing,  and customer service functions for
the  Green  Giant  products.  In 1999,  1998,  and 1997 the sale of Green  Giant
vegetables  account for 50%,  49%, and 69% of net sales (see Sales  Information,
note 12). The following  information  is presented in  accordance  with SFAS No.

14. Discontinued Operations

In December 1998,  the Company sold a significant  portion of its Juice Division
to Northland Cranberries, Inc., together with an exclusive license to market and
sell Seneca juice  products,  for  $28,200,000  in cash plus the  assumption  of
certain liabilities. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain on the disposal
of $6,760,000,  which was recognized  during the Company's  fourth quarter ended
March 31, 1999.  This sale included plants in Dundee,  New York;  Mountain Home,
North Carolina;  Jackson,  Wisconsin; a warehouse in Eau Claire, Michigan; and a
receiving station in Portland, New York.

In  January  1999,  the  Company  completed  the sale to Tree Top,  Inc.  of its
processing  facility  in  Prosser,  Washington  together  with  its  non-branded
specialty fruit concentrate business and an exclusive license to market and sell
the Company's branded  applesauce.  Tree Top paid  approximately  $29,000,000 in
cash.  This  transaction   resulted  in  a  pre-tax  gain  on  the  disposal  of
$10,427,000, which was also recognized in the Company's fourth quarter.

As a result of these  sales,  the  disposition  of the Juice  Business  has been
accounted for as a discontinued operation. The consolidated financial statements
of prior years have been restated to separately  report  discontinued  operating
results.   Net  sales  for  the  Juice  Business  were   $121,290,000  in  1999,
$142,694,000 in 1998, and $159,119,000 in 1997.  Interest  expense  allocated to
discontinued operations includes an allocation of corporate interest expense and
amounts  directly  related  to the  discontinued  business.  The  allocation  of
corporate  interest  expense was based, in part, on a ratio of the net assets of
the  discontinued   operations  to  the  sum  of  consolidated  net  assets  and
consolidated  debt.  The  amounts  allocated  in 1999,  1998,  and 1997  totaled
$1,567,000, $2,580,000, and $2,867,000, respectively.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Board of Directors  and Stockholders of
Seneca Foods Corporation
Pittsford, New York

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Seneca Foods
Corporation  and  subsidiaries  as of March 31,  1999 and 1998,  and the related
consolidated  statements of net earnings,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1999.  These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of Seneca  Foods  Corporation  and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for each of the three  years in the period  ended March 31,
1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

capital  requirements,  operating  and financial  condition of the Company.  The
Company has not declared or paid a common dividend in many years.

</TABLE>

Earnings  for the fourth  quarter have  historically  reflected  adjustments  of
previously  estimated  raw  material  costs and  production  levels.  Due to the
dependence  on fruit and  vegetable  yields  of the  Company's  food  processing
segment,  interim  costing must be estimated.  The first and second  quarters of
1999 and all of 1998 have been restated to reflect the sale of the Juice segment
in the third and  fourth  quarters  of 1999.  The  fourth  quarter  includes  an
extraordinary loss from debt extinguishment $1,222,000 after tax benefit.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

 As a result of its operating and financing  activities,  the Company is exposed
to certain market risks including  changes in commodity pricing and fluctuations
in interest rates.  Commodity  pricing exposure  includes weather  phenomena and
their  effect on industry  volumes,  prices,  product  quality,  and costs.  The
Company  manages its  exposure to  commodity  price risk  primarily  through its
regular  operating  activities.  The Company has not used  derivative  financial
instruments.  The Company has not utilized financial  instruments for trading or
other speculative purposes.

 Interest Rate Risk

As a result of its regular borrowing activities, the Company's operating results
are  exposed to  fluctuations  in  interest  rates,  which it manages  primarily
through its regular financing activities. Although the Company does not have any
short-term debt as of March 31, 1999, it uses bank lines of credit with variable
interest rates to finance  seasonal  working capital  requirements.  The Company
maintains  investments in cash equivalents  ($26.9 million as of March 31, 1999)
and does have investments in a modest amount of marketable securities. Long-term
debt  represents  secured and unsecured  notes and  debentures and certain notes
payable to insurance  companies used to finance  long-term  investments  such as
business  acquisitions.  Long-term  debt bears  interest  at fixed and  variable
rates. The following table provides  information  about the Company's  financial
instruments  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents
principal cash flows and sinking fund requirements and related  weighted-average
interest  rates by expected  maturity date.  Weighted-average  interest rates on
variable-rate debt are based on current rates as of March 31, 1999:
