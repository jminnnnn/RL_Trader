                         INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT


The Board of Directors
Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc.


We have examined management's assertion about Consumer Portfolio Services,
Inc.'s (the Company) compliance with the minimum servicing standards identified
in the relevant sections of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's
UNIFORM SINGLE ATTESTATION PROGRAM FOR MORTGAGE BANKERS (USAP) as of and for the
year ended December 31, 1998 included in the accompanying management assertion.
Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with those minimum
servicing standards. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's
assertion about the Company's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
relevant minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company's compliance with the minimum servicing
standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company has complied in all
material respects with the aforementioned minimum servicing standards, as they
relate to the servicing of automobile installment contracts, as of and for the
year ended December 31, 1998 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

                             MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION

of automobile installment contracts. As of and for this same period, Consumer
