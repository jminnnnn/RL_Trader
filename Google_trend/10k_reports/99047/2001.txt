                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business

NYFIX, Inc. (the "Company" or "NYFIX") develops and markets advanced  electronic
trading systems to brokerage  firms,  international  banks and global  exchanges
trading in equities and derivative  instruments.  The Company's NYFIX Network, a
combined  Financial  Information  Exchange  protocol ("FIX") and Exchange Access
Network,  enables  users to  electronically  communicate  trade  data  among the
buy-side,  sell-side and exchange floor environments.  NYFIX is headquartered in
Stamford,  Connecticut and maintains operations in New York, Chicago and London.
The  Company  was  incorporated  in New York in 1991 and is listed on the Nasdaq
Stock Market under the symbol NYFX. Prior to March 6, 2000, the Company's common
stock was traded on the American  Stock  Exchange  under the ticker  symbol NYF.
Prior to October 25, 1999, the Company's common stock was traded on the American
Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol TSI.

The  Company's  goal is to become the leading  provider of real-time  electronic
trade  entry  and  routing  systems  and  connectivity  services  to the  global
financial  services  industry.  The Company  offers its customers the ability to
enter and route orders and executions electronically from "end-to-end," from the
buy-side/retail  institution  or remote  branch  office  through to the exchange
floors and electronic exchanges.  The Company's technology is used by such major
firms as Lehman  Brothers,  Deutsche Bank, UBS Warburg,  ING Barings and Merrill
Lynch, among others.

The Company's systems provide  electronic order entry,  order routing,  tracking
and risk monitoring  capabilities,  replacing existing paper and telephone based
trading  and  eliminating  a number of  redundant  steps in the  order  flow and
execution  reporting process. As the financial industry continues to move from a
paper  and voice  driven  tracking  environment  to  real-time  electronic-based
trading,  management believes NYFIX is well positioned to take advantage of this
growing  trend.  Wall Street  firms are  recognizing  the ability of  electronic
trading  systems to  enhance  order and  information  flow and  improve  trading
performance by eliminating trading errors and providing on-line risk management,
in  addition  to the  cost  efficiencies  associated  with  electronic  trading.
Numerous trading  scandals have provided further impetus for the  implementation
of  electronic   trading   systems  with  risk  monitoring  and  audit  tracking
capabilities by financial risk managers.

In September  1997, the Company  launched its NYFIX Network,  a FIX and Exchange
Access  Network  designed  to provide  the  financial  community  with a central
electronic  meeting place for routing  real-time  orders and other FIX messages.
NYFIX provides the Company's equities customers access to its subscription-based
quote,  order and execution  routing  systems as well as providing  connectivity
between the buy-side,  sell-side  and exchange  floor  environments  through the
industry  standard trade  communication  protocol,  FIX. NYFIX offers  financial
firms the ability to utilize the Company's systems without having to invest in a
communications  infrastructure.  Furthermore,  the Company's  NYFIX Data Centers
offer the  potential  for an "any to any"  relationship  for routing  orders and
executions between and among firms, various exchanges and alternative sources of
liquidity including Electronic  Communications  Networks (ECNs). The Company has
made considerable  progress implementing its  subscription-based  NYFIX business
model throughout 2000 and management believes the Company is well positioned for
further growth in 2001.  NYFIX continues to provide the financial  industry with
complete systems,  including the raw terminals (hardware manufactured by NYFIX),
the software and the infrastructure  (through its NYFIX Data Centers) to tie the
trading  industry  together for the  electronic  entry and routing of orders and
executions.

All of the Company's products are available in flexible building blocks that can
be sold as  complete  systems or  separately  to  complement  existing  customer
components.  This has given the Company the ability to collect revenue from each
"link" of the trading process.  The Company also continues to expand and enhance
its  product  portfolio  with  new  and   complementary   software  modules  and
connectivity  services  that allow the Company to collect  revenue from multiple
levels.  The Company offers its trading  systems on a subscription  basis,  with
hardware, software and maintenance provided for a monthly fee. For the Company's
customers,  this pricing model offers minimal up-front  investment in technology
as well as an alternative to costly in-house  development.  For the Company,  it
offers a  simplification  of the sales  cycle as well as  significant  recurring
revenue.  From time to time, the Company does offer certain  products (such as a
custom  enhancement)  for a one-time  fee. The Company as a whole is moving away
from its previous capital sales model and now offers its systems,  including the
entire NYFIX product line, on a subscription basis.

Information  about the  Company's  business  segment  and sales to  unaffiliated
customers,  gross  profit  and  identifiable  assets,  by  geographic  area,  is
contained  in  "Note  14  -  Business  Segment  Information"  appearing  in  the
consolidated  financial statements as noted in the Index appearing under Item 14
(a) (1).

NYFIX Millennium, L.L.C.
- ------------------------
In October of 1999,  the Company  announced the  formation of NYFIX  Millennium,
L.L.C. ("NYFIX Millennium"),  with Deutsche Bank, ING Barings,  Lehman Brothers,
Morgan  Stanley  Dean  Witter,  Sanford  C.  Bernstein  & Co.,  Inc.,  SG  Cowen
Securities  and  UBS  Warburg  (the  "Consortium").  NYFIX  owns  50%  of  NYFIX
Millennium and the Consortium owns the remaining 50%.

In 2000,  NYFIX  Millennium  became a  Broker/Dealer  and member of the National
Association of Securities  Dealers  (NASD).  NYFIX  Millennium is an Alternative
Trading System ("ATS"),  an electronic  execution  facility for equities trading
transactions.  The System  matches  buyers and sellers of securities  through an
electronic matching facility. The system is designed to provide investors with a
valuable  tool for  achieving  "best  execution,"  by aiming  to help  investors
achieve price  improvement,  ensure  anonymity  and reduce market  fragmentation
through the electronic linkage of various liquidity sources, including exchanges
and electronic  communication  networks (ECNs).  NYFIX Millennium  leverages the
NYFIX  network's  large order routing  share volume to provide a more  efficient
liquidity source for the financial community. NYFIX Millennium is referred to as
a Hybrid Market System because it combines the electronic  execution  technology
of an ECN with the liquidity of traditional  primary markets.  Through real-time
matching and automatic  forwarding of unexecuted  orders to the primary exchange
markets,  NYFIX  Millennium  plans to  provide  traders  unparalleled  access to
liquidity.  NYFIX Millennium plans to generate  transaction-oriented  revenue by
providing high quality executions,  providing price improvement and/or liquidity
enhancements,   reducing   execution  costs  and  providing  superior  execution
services.  The NYFIX Millennium ATS went into a test phase with a limited number
of customers in late 2000.

On March 14,  2001,  NYFIX  Millennium  added  Bank of America  and First  Union
Securities as new partners, with additional partners and funding expected in the
near term. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement of NYFIX Millennium,
each new partner  contributed  $2,000,000 to NYFIX  Millennium,  and the Company
maintained  its 50%  ownership  interest in NYFIX  Millennium  in  exchange  for
reducing  certain of its  rights to share in future  dividend  distributions  of
NYFIX  Millennium.  The Company issued 94,000 shares of its common stock to each
new partner in return for the same option rights noted above.


                                    Products

Portfolio of Complete Electronic Trading Systems
- ------------------------------------------------
NYFIX  supplies  complete,   standardized  trading  solutions  that  consist  of
hardware,  proprietary  software packages and network technology for the trading
of equities and derivative  instruments.  In addition,  the Company supports its
customers in all aspects of planning and  implementing  these systems as well as
providing on-going technical support.

The Company has two principal product lines: Equities and Future & Options. Each
product line maintains technical  management staff with expert knowledge so that
the  individual  product  lines are  efficiently  targeted  to their  respective
customers.  The Equities  product line  operates  primarily out of the Company's
Stamford  and New York offices and the Future & Options  product  line  operates
primarily  out of the  Company's  London  and  Chicago  offices.  The London and
Chicago  offices are included in a wholly-owned  subsidiary of the Company known
as Trinitech  Systems  International,  Inc. Each location has the opportunity to
sell, or enter into subscriptions for, each of the Company's product lines.


                                       2

Equities Product Line
- ---------------------
The Company has developed eight systems for equities trading:
     1.          Market Looks System
     2.          FloorReport(R)
     3.          FIXTrader(R)
     4.          NYFIX(R)Network Services
     5.          Breakwatch(TM)
     6.          TradeWatch
     7.          NYFIX HandHeld
     8.          Nasdaq Agency Interface

The NYFIX Market Looks System consists of the Trinitech Touchpad(R),  a scanner,
server and  proprietary  software.  The  touchpad was designed by the Company to
simplify and expedite the entry of orders and information related to the trading
of financial  instruments.  The  Trinitech  Touchpad(R),  with its patented flat
panel design,  was  developed to optimize  critical  trader/broker  desktop real
estate. Its proprietary open architecture  offers seamless  integration with all
major industry  operating  systems,  thereby allowing customers to freely choose
between  the most  popular  operating  systems.  The  Market  Looks  Systems  is
comprised of two complementary  software modules:  FloorLook(R) for the exchange
floor booth and FloorLook  ImageViewer(R)  for the upstairs trader  workstation.
The Market Looks System  solves the  challenge  faced by member firms in getting
real-time quotes or "looks" on stocks directly from the exchange floor to firms'
upstairs  trading  operations.  The Market  Looks  System  operates  by scanning
handwritten  quote slips called  "looks" into a scanner by a floor clerk located
at the member's booth. These scanned looks are instantly transmitted to upstairs
traders  at  their   workstations   in  multiple   sites  and  remote   offices.
Implementation of the system results in the elimination of repetitive  telephone
traffic  between clerks and traders.  The Market Looks System helps firms reduce
errors and disseminate information more efficiently.

The NYFIX FloorReport(R) System is a complete electronic order management system
designed  for exchange  member  firms'  exchange  floor  operations.  Orders are
received  electronically  from  upstairs  traders (via the FIX  Protocol),  with
execution  information routed back in the same efficient manner.  FloorReport(R)
enables floor clerks to route  execution  information to sales and block traders
in real time,  enabling  them to better  service  their  customers.  FloorReport
organizes  orders in a central  blotter,  helping clerks by tracking  status and
calculating average price in real-time.

The NYFIX FIXTrader  System is a complete order  management  system for upstairs
traders,  which allows the electronic entry and routing of orders and executions
between buy-side institutions,  sales and block desks and exchange floor booths.
Traders enter orders quickly and  efficiently  through a Touchpad(R) (or a mouse
and keyboard  configuration)  and which are then routed to the appropriate venue
in seconds,  with executions routed back in the same efficient manner.  With the
financial  industry's adoption of FIX as the standard protocol for communicating
electronically,   FIXTrader(R)  offers  an  easy  way  for  firms  to  gain  FIX
compliance. FIXTrader(R) enables firms to receive orders electronically from the
buy-side  as well as  connect  to back  office  systems  helping  firms  achieve
straight-through processing.

The NYFIX  Network is a  Combined  FIX and  Exchange  Access  Network  that link
various  companies   throughout  the  financial   industry  for  the  electronic
communication of trade information.  Connecting  buy-side,  brokerage,  exchange
floor booths and various exchange  systems,  NYFIX is a private,  secure network
designed  to  provide  firms  with  secure and  reliable  transmission  of their
electronic  trade  information.  NYFIX  provides a number of benefits to clients
including  reduced cost  compared to  maintaining  one's own network,  increased
routing options and network management ensuring connectivity between parties.

Breakwatch(TM)  is NYFIX's  application for identifying  intra-day trade errors.
This program  helps firms  identify  potential  trading  errors,  giving firms a
chance to rectify mistakes on the day the trade takes place. Breakwatch(TM) also
provides a link into the OCS system, simplifying reporting as per exchange trade
reporting requirements.

TradeWatch  is NYFIX's  application  for  monitoring  an entire  trading  desk's
positions. This application,  used by head traders and/or risk managers, enables
management to keep apprised of all the trading  desk's  positions

                                       3
<PAGE>
by integrating data from all of the firm's FIXTrader workstations.

The NYFIX  HandHeld  is the  Company's  Market  Looks  System,  which  runs on a
handheld computer. This wireless, lightweight computer is used by exchange floor
brokers to transmit  looks from the  specialist  to their booth and  directly to
traders'   workstations.   Battery-powered,   the  NYFIX  HandHeld  enables  the
simultaneous  transmission  of looks to  multiple  traders  as well as  enabling
traders to receive  looks  directly from "the crowd" on the trading  floor.  The
Handheld units were rolled out during the first quarter of 2000.

NYFIX's Nasdaq Agency Interface is an application  designed to accommodate order
management  and  routing for the Nasdaq  marketplace.  Level II  compliant,  the
Nasdaq Agency Interface enables traders to communicate  electronically  with the
Nasdaq market.

During  2000,  the  Company  enhanced  its  product  line by  adding a number of
auxiliary services,  such as increased connectivity options and linkages as well
as  increased  functionality.  Product  development  continues  to be focused on
adding more  features to the  Company's  existing  product  line,  accommodating
customer  requests.  The  Company is also  developing  additional  products  and
services to be offered in 2001.

Product Pricing - Equities
All of NYFIX's products for equities  trading are sold on a subscription  basis,
with hardware, software and maintenance provided for a monthly subscription fee.
Subscription  agreements  usually run from one to three  years,  with  automatic
multiple  year  renewal  provisions  included.  Products are priced on a monthly
basis per terminal.

Product Penetration - Equities
Building upon the Data Center  established  in late 1996,  the Company  launched
NYFIX(R),  its combined FIX and Exchange Access Network,  in September 1997. The
Network and data center,  strategically located several blocks from the New York
Stock  Exchange,  offers easy  monthly  subscription-based  access to all of the
Company's quote,  order and execution  routing  systems.  The NYFIX Network also
allows  smaller  "two-dollar"  and  independent  brokers access to the Company's
systems.  Firms no longer need a  communications  infrastructure  to utilize the
Company's systems, as they can simply subscribe to the service. During 2000, the
Company  has  continued  to invest in the NYFIX data  center  infrastructure  to
accommodate customer needs and growth of the service.

Futures & Options Product Line
- ------------------------------
For the futures & options  trading  market,  the  Company  markets its Futures &
Options Order Book Management System ("OBMS"), which enables futures and options
traders to enter,  route and manage orders and  executions in real-time.  Global
order routing between different  international branches of the same firm and all
the major global exchanges, both open outcry and electronic is supported by this
comprehensive system. OBMS is offered utilizing the Company's patented Trinitech
Touchpad(R) or in stand-alone software versions.

Product Pricing - Futures & Options
The Company offers OBMS on a subscription or transaction  basis,  with hardware,
software and  maintenance  provided for a monthly fee.  Subscription  agreements
usually  run  from one to three  years  with  automatic  multiple  year  renewal
provisions included.  When OBMS is sold on a transaction basis, the Company will
receive a fee per futures  contract  traded through the system with a guaranteed
monthly minimum payment.

Product Penetration - Futures & Options
OBMS has been  utilized  by a number of leading  firms in the  futures & options
industry,  including CS First Boston,  Dresdner  Kleinwort  Benson,  and Merrill
Lynch, among others.

Electronic Trading Systems
- --------------------------

The Company  believes that the financial  trading  industry  represents an ideal
example  of  a  uniform  niche  market.  The  characteristics  of  this  market,
particularly  its low level of  automation  at the  trade-entry  or  deal-making
level, provide an excellent  opportunity for the marketing of cost-effective and
innovative technical solutions. The Company believes that this market is clearly

community,  the  trading  industry  allows the  Company  to market  standardized
products in a uniform  manner for  Equities  and Futures & Options  trading on a
global  basis.  Management  believes  the  Company's  offering  of products on a
subscription   or  transaction   basis  through  a  data  center  solution  will
significantly  aid in the  roll-out of its products on an  industry-wide  basis,
opening up new markets for the Company's products.

The Company continued its aggressive marketing efforts in 2000 and increased its
global   presence  by   exhibiting   its  products  at  numerous   domestic  and
international  technology and financial industry  conferences.  The Company also
generated  significant  press coverage with respect to its FIX trading solutions
and industry wide FIX and exchange connectivity network,  NYFIX(R).  The Company
intends to continue its marketing initiatives in 2001.

                                   Competition

Electronic Trading Systems
- --------------------------
Competition exists in the Company's primary market. The Company believes that it
competes favorably with its trading systems, gaining additional leverage through
optimized  integration  of  NYFIX's  advanced  systems  and its large  number of
connectivity  options. To further enhance the marketability of its systems,  the
Company is implementing  its solutions on the most popular and  well-established
client server architectures.

The Company believes that its technology  offers unique  advantages  compared to
alternative  technologies utilized by competitors.  The Company believes,  based
upon customer feedback,  that its systems  successfully fulfill their promise of
immediate  entry,  routing  and  reporting  of  trading  positions,  operational
savings,  reduction of input error and  improvement  in reporting for compliance
purposes.

The  Company  also  believes  that its  management  and staff  have an  in-depth
knowledge of the  inner-workings  of trading  rooms,  exchange  floors,  and the
overall  marketplace,  thus  facilitating its ability to serve client needs with
technological hardware and software adaptations.

                               Product Production

The Company designs, develops and produces its proprietary software and hardware
products at its facility in Stamford,  Connecticut. The Company is not dependent
upon any one  supplier,  vendor or  subcontractor  for any of its  manufacturing
components.

                             Patents and Trademarks

The  Company   maintains  a  program  of  obtaining  and  protecting   U.S.  and
international  patents and trademarks.  The Company believes that the success of
its business is not  materially  dependent  on the  existence or duration of any
patent,  group of patents or  trademarks.  The  Company's  trademarks  should be
available for the Company's use as long as it desires.

                                 Major Customers

Information about the Company's  dependence on major customers relating to sales
and accounts receivable is contained in "Note 8 - Major Customers"  appearing in
the financial statements as noted in the Index appearing under Item 14 (a) (1).

                               Rule 123 Amendments

NYFIX is aware of amendments on file with the SEC to change certain  regulations
governing the recording and transmission of orders to and on the NYSE floor. The
first phase of such regulations  calls for all orders received on the NYSE floor
to be input into an electronic order management system for better monitoring and
tracking of trades.  The second phase calls for all orders to the exchange to be
sent  electronically.   The  Company  believes  this  regulation  is  positively
impacting  NYFIX's  business.  The Company already  produces  systems capable of
meeting and exceeding  regulatory  requirements  with many  additional  features
designed to reduce errors and maximize customer

                                       5
<PAGE>

efficiency.  Management  believes that as the Rule 123 amendments wind their way
through  the SEC's  notice and  comment  period  NYFIX will be  provided an even
greater  opportunity  to capture  market share both on the exchange floor and on
the upstairs trading desks.

                                    Employees

As of March 16, 2001 the Company had 124 full-time employees.

The management discussion and analysis and the information provided elsewhere in
this Form 10-K contain forward looking statements regarding the Company's future
plans,  objectives  and  expected  performance.  Those  statements  are based on

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following  discussion and analysis  should be read in  conjunction  with the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  Historical results are not
necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.

The  Company  commenced  operations  in  January  1991,  initially  focusing  on
order-capturing of trading information via its Guided-Input(R)  Touchpad system,
and since then has transitioned from a hardware vendor to a provider of complete
infrastructure,  systems,  software and  wireless  trading  technologies  to the
brokerage industry. The Company provides electronic trading and straight-through
trade  processing  solutions to various  participants in the brokerage  industry
such as brokerage firms,  international  banks and global  exchanges  trading in
equities,  futures, options and currencies. The Company's deployment of products
and services via the  Company's  NYFIX network has resulted in its customer base
processing  a daily  volume  ranging  from as low as 200  million  shares in the
beginning  of the year to single  trading days  exceeding  more than 500 million
shares towards the end of year 2000.

By 1996, the financial  services industry had adopted the Financial  Information
Exchange Protocol,  commonly referred to as the FIX protocol, which provides the
brokerage  industry  with a common  underlying  language  to  enable  electronic
trading and  communications.  In late 1997,  the Company  built a  communication
infrastructure  known as the "NYFIX network"  utilizing the FIX protocol through
an individual  dedicated  circuit into the NYFIX network  which  provides  NYFIX
customers  with global  electronic  connectivity  for trade order  routing.  The
Company  currently offers its NYFIX services,  consisting of integrated  systems
including  hardware and software,  together with linkage  through its NYFIX data
center.  Customers  subscribe  to NYFIX  services  by paying a  monthly  fee per
terminal  for  use of  the  Company's  integrated  infrastructure  and  software
systems.  Beginning in late 1997, the Company  focused  primarily on selling its
products and services on a subscription basis with ongoing monthly  subscription
fees rather than a software  and capital  equipment  sales model with  one-time,
upfront fees.  Since making this  transition,  total  revenues have increased to
$23,980,000  in 2000 from  $5,006,000 in 1997,  representing  a compound  annual
growth rate of 69%. The Company has been  profitable  since the first quarter of
1999 and has had eight consecutive quarters of increasing profitability.

The  Company's  revenues  comprise  subscription,  sales  and  service  contract
revenue. Consistent with the Company's transition to a subscription sales model,
subscription  fees represent a majority and increasing  share of total revenues.
Subscription revenue contracts are primarily with brokerage firms, international
banks and global exchanges trading in equities, and are generally for an initial
period  of  one  to  three  years  with  one  to  three  year  renewal  periods.
Subscription  revenues are recognized ratably over the lives of the subscription
agreements  with  customers  and begin  once  installation  is  complete.  Sales
revenue,  which is comprised of software sales and capital  equipment  sales, is
generated primarily by sales to customers in the futures, options and currencies
trading market, and is expected to decrease as a percentage of total revenues as
the Company  continues to shift its focus to  servicing  those  markets  using a
subscription fee model. Sales revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product
and  acceptance  by the  customer.  Service  contract  revenue is  comprised  of
maintenance contracts for capital sales equipment and subscription equipment and
is  recognized  ratably  over the period that the service is  provided.  Service
contract  revenue on  subscription  contracts is charged to customers as a fixed
percentage of such contracts.

Cost of revenues  principally  consists  of  subscription  communication  lines,
amortization  of  capitalized  product  enhancement  costs and  depreciation  of
subscription-based equipment, labor, materials and overhead.

Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  account for the majority of the
Company's  operating  expenses  and consist of salaries and  benefits,  rent and
office  expenses,  non-customer  specific  communication  fees,  provisions  for
doubtful  accounts and marketing  expenses.  During the past several years,  the
Company has expanded its efforts to support an increasing number of services and
to increase the number of exchanges, brokerage firms and "buy-side" institutions
connecting  to  the  NYFIX  network.  Management  believes  that  its  continued
investment  in  the   development   of  the  NYFIX  system  and  its  associated
applications  and  services  has  increased  order  flow,  which in turn  should
facilitate both revenue growth and further distribution of its products.

Research  and  development  expenses  relate  to  developing  new  products  and
technologies  to meet the current and future needs of the  Company's  customers.
These costs  consist  primarily of salaries and related  costs for technical

                                       8

<PAGE>

and programming personnel.

Depreciation and amortization  expense consists of depreciation and amortization
of equipment and software used to operate the Company's systems.

On October 27, 1999,  the Company  announced the  formation of NYFIX  Millennium
L.L.C., a consortium of the Company and seven international investment banks and
brokerage  firms,  consisting of Deutsche  Bank, ING Barings,  Lehman  Brothers,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., SG Cowen Securities and
UBS Warburg.  NYFIX Millennium is registered as a Broker/Dealer and is operating
in compliance with Regulation ATS. In October 2000, NYFIX  Millennium  commenced
the roll-out of its ATS on a limited basis to the Company's existing clients and
is  allowing  them to use the  system  without  charging  for  orders  executed.
Although the number of users and orders  passing  through NYFIX  Millennium  has
been increasing, the Company currently does not anticipate that NYFIX Millennium
will generate revenue until sufficient liquidity has been established within the
system. Once sufficient liquidity is established in the system, NYFIX Millennium
intends to generate  revenue by charging for each transaction on a fee per share
basis.

On March 14,  2001,  NYFIX  Millennium  added  Bank of America  and First  Union
Securities as new partners, with additional partners and funding expected in the
near term. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement of NYFIX Millennium,
each new partner  contributed  $2,000,000 to NYFIX  Millennium,  and the Company
maintained  its 50%  ownership  interest in NYFIX  Millennium  in  exchange  for
reducing  certain of its  rights to share in future  dividend  distributions  of
NYFIX  Millennium.  The Company issued 94,000 shares of its common stock to each
new partner in return for the same option rights noted above.

Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999

Revenues
Subscription  revenue  increased 137% to $15,955,000 in 2000, from $6,733,000 in
1999,  principally due to increased desktop placements among existing customers,
and also  the  addition  of new  customers  and new  product  offerings  sold to
existing and new  customers.  As a percentage  of total  revenues,  subscription
revenue increased to 67% in 2000 from 55% in 1999.

Sales revenue  increased 37% to $5,089,000 in 2000, from $3,715,000 in 1999. The
increase  in  sales  revenue  is  principally  due to  customer  demand  for the
Company's Order Book Management  System ("OBMS")  derivatives  trading  software
products.  As a percentage of total revenue,  sales revenue  decreased to 21% in
2000, from 30% in 1999,  which is consistent with the Company's  transition to a
subscription-based  model,  with software sales comprising the majority of sales
revenue.

Service contract revenue increased 67% to $2,936,000 in 2000, from $1,761,000 in
1999,  principally due to an increase in subscription contract revenue. In 2000,
service contract revenue  comprised 12% of total revenue,  as compared to 14% in
1999.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit
Gross profit as a percentage of total revenues increased to 73% in 2000 from 69%
in 1999. The increase in gross profit  percentage  principally  resulted from an
increase in the amount of higher  margin  software  installations  and  improved
pricing on  communication  charges  relating  to  subscription  agreements.  The
Company obtains its materials and supplies from a variety of vendors in the U.S.
and Far East and did not  experience  any  significant  price  increases  in its
component  parts  purchased  during  2000.  Included  in  cost of  revenues  was
amortization expense of product enhancement costs of $1,185,000 and $719,000 for
2000 and 1999, respectively.  Also included in cost of revenues was depreciation
expense for subscription-based equipment of $1,257,000 and $586,000 for 2000 and
1999, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative
Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  increased  50% to $9,419,000 in
2000,  from  $6,290,000 in 1999, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues
to 39% in  2000  from  52% in  1999.  The  dollar  increase  reflects  increased
salaries,  related personnel costs, rent expense and various office expenses due
to personnel  increases to support the

                                       9

<PAGE>

Company's growth. Also increasing were  non-recoverable  communication fees, and
bad debt  expense  primarily  due to certain  independent  brokers  going out of
business during 2000.

Research and Development
Research  and  development  expenses  increased  53% to $454,000  in 2000,  from
$297,000  in 1999,  as the  Company  continued  to  research  ways to expand its
product portfolio.

Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization  expenses increased 89% to $1,255,000 in 2000 from
$663,000  in  1999,  reflecting  principally  the  continued  investment  in the
Company's infrastructure.

Interest Expense
Interest  expense  increased  50% to  $333,000 in 2000,  from  $222,000 in 1999,
principally  as a result of capital  lease  obligations  entered into during the
period and higher average  balances  outstanding on the Company's line of credit
due to the draw down of an additional $700,000 in August 1999, offset in part by
repayment of the principal of $83,000 a month commencing in July 2000.

Interest Income
Interest  income  increased  38% to  $156,000  in 2000,  from  $113,000 in 1999,
principally due to higher average cash balances maintained by the Company during
the year ended December 31, 2000 versus the comparable period in 1999.

Provision for Income Taxes
The  provision for income taxes  increased to $601,000 in 2000,  from $94,000 in
1999.  As of  December  31,  1999,  the  Company  established  a full  valuation
allowance of  $2,010,000  for its  deferred  tax assets based upon  management's
determination  of the amount that would  ultimately be realized.  Based upon the
continued  profitability  of the Company during 2000 as well as expected  future
profitability,  management  determined as of December 31, 2000, that a valuation
allowance was no longer required.

At December 31, 2000, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward  balance
for federal  income tax purposes of  $3,776,000,  expiring in 2014 through 2019.
This  carryforward  balance  may be  significantly  limited  under the  Internal
Revenue  Code as a result of  ownership  changes  resulting  from the  Company's
equity offerings.  In the event that the Company continues to be profitable,  as
it has been since the first quarter of 1999,  the Company will have income taxes
on its  earnings.  These  taxes  will  have an effect  on the  Company's  future
reported net earnings and cash flows.

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998

Revenues
Subscription  revenue  increased 196% to $6,733,000 in 1999,  from $2,278,000 in
1998. The increase in  subscription  revenue is principally due to the Company's
transition from offering its products and services on a capital sales basis to a
subscription basis. The increase in subscription revenue is also partly due to a
number of new product  enhancements and order routing services introduced during
the year as well as the Company's continued increase in new orders.

Sales revenue  increased 40% to $3,715,000 in 1999, from $2,653,000 in 1998. The
increase  in sales  revenue  was  principally  due to  increased  demand for the
Company's OBMS derivatives trading software.

Service contract revenue increased 35% to $1,761,000 in 1999, from $1,304,000 in
1998,  primarily due to the increase in subscription  contract revenue. In 1999,
service contract revenue comprised 14% of total revenues,  as compared to 21% in
1998.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit
Gross profit as a percentage of total  revenues  increased to 69% in 1999,  from
59% in 1998,  principally  due to an  increase  in the  amount of higher  margin
software installations and subscription agreements. During 1999, the Company did
not experience any significant  price  increases in component  parts  purchased.
Included in cost of sales was

                                       10

<PAGE>

amortization  expense for product enhancement costs of $719,000 and $479,000 for
1999 and 1998,  respectively.  Also  included in cost of sales was  depreciation
expense for  subscription-based  equipment of $586,000 and $291,000 for 1999 and
1998, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative
Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  increased  27% to $6,290,000 in
1999, from $4,957,000 in 1998. This increase reflected increases in salaries and
related personnel costs,  travel expenses and various office expenses  resulting
from continued expansion both in the U.S. and in London.

Research and Development
Research  and  development  expenses  decreased  45% to $297,000  in 1999,  from
$537,000 in 1998, primarily as a result of the Company focusing on enhancing its
existing product line in 1999 as opposed to developing new products in 1998.

Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization  expenses  increased 40% to $663,000 in 1999, from
$475,000  in  1998,  reflecting  principally  the  continued  investment  in the
Company's infrastructure in its NYFIX data center.

Interest Expense
Interest expense increased 106% to $222,000 in 1999, from $108,000 in 1998. This
increase  was  principally  a  result  of  higher  balances  outstanding  on the
Company's  new line of credit and the cost of warrants  issued for the guarantee
of the amounts outstanding under the line of credit.

Interest Income
Interest  income  increased  23% to  $113,000  in 1999,  from  $92,000  in 1998,
principally as a result of higher cash balances maintained by the Company.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Prior to achieving the Company's present levels of profitability,  the Company's
primary  source of  liquidity  had been equity  capital and  drawdowns  from the
Company's line of credit agreement.  In November 1998 and in September 1999, the
Company raised $3,450,000 and $2,547,000,  respectively, from private placements
of  securities.  At December 31,  2000,  the cash and cash  equivalents  balance
increased to $4,867,000  from $1,566,000 at December 31, 1999 as a result of the
increase  in net  earnings  and the  exercise  of stock  options  and  warrants,
partially offset by capital  expenditures and the acquisition of other assets to
support the Company's infrastructure and repayments under the line of credit.

At December 31, 2000, the Company had total debt of $3,823,000, which represents
amounts  outstanding  under the line of credit and  capital  lease  obligations.
Subsequent to year-end,  the Company has entered into capital lease  obligations
for service bureau equipment valued at $524,000. The leases are for a three-year
period,  with  annual  payments  of  $193,000.  Except for these  capital  lease
obligations,  at December 31, 2000, the Company had no material  commitments for
capital expenditures or inventory purchases.

On July 13,  1998,  the Company  entered  into a  three-year  $3 million line of
credit  agreement with a financial  institution  with advances on such agreement
available to the Company  during the first 18 months.  The credit  agreement was
primarily intended to finance equipment expenditures. The credit agreement bears
interest at either LIBOR plus 1.25% or the bank's prime rate,  at the  Company's
discretion. The Company drew down an aggregate of $1,800,000 under the agreement
during  1998 and an  additional  $700,000  during  1999.  The  credit  agreement
prohibited  the Company from making  principal  repayments  prior to February 1,
2000.  Repayment  of principal  commenced  on July 30, 2000 with twelve  monthly
installments  of $83,333  with the  remaining  balance due on July 30,  2001.  A
non-employee  shareholder of the Company and the Company's president  personally
secured the debt.  In  consideration  for  securing  the credit  agreement,  the
non-employee shareholder and the Company's president received 337,500 and 56,250
warrants,  respectively,  to purchase the Company's  common stock at $2.8333 per
share, which was the market value of the Company's common stock on the date such
warrants were issued.  Expense related to the warrants is being  recognized over
the three-year term of the credit agreement.

The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity,  including cash generated from
operations and issuances of common stock,  to support its cash needs in the year
2001.

Working Capital
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had working capital of $9,159,000 and
$4,513,000, respectively, representing an 82% improvement. The Company's present
capital resources  include proceeds from internal  operations and from issuances
of common stock.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities
During 2000, net cash provided by operations was $9,432,000,  as compared to net
cash provided by  operations  of $2,445,000 in 1999.  This increase is primarily
attributable  to the 491% increase in net  earnings,  to $5,676,000 in 2000 from
$960,000 in 1999.

Cash Used in Investing Activities
During 2000 and 1999,  net cash used in investing  activities was $9,387,000 and
$8,769,000,  respectively.  The  increase  principally  represents  payments for
purchases of equipment  related to the  Company's  data center and  subscription
equipment and payments  related to product  enhancement  costs for the Company's
product portfolio, along with advances made to NYFIX Millennium.

Cash Provided By Financing Activities
During 2000 and 1999, net proceeds from financing activities were $3,256,000 and
$3,942,000,  respectively.  During 2000 proceeds of $3,955,000 from the exercise
of warrants and stock  options were  partially  offset by  repayments  under the
credit line of $500,000 and principal  payments under capital lease  obligations
of $200,000.  During 1999,  proceeds were $2,547,000 from a private placement of
common  stock,  the exercise of warrants and stock  options  generated  funds of
$695,000, and borrowings under our line of credit were $700,000.

Seasonality

The Company  believes  that its  operations  are not  significantly  effected by
seasonality.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.
133  ("SFAS  133"),   "Accounting   for  Derivative   Instruments   and  Hedging
Activities." SFAS 133 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000. SFAS 133, as amended,  establishes  accounting and reporting standards for
derivative  instruments,  including certain derivative  instruments  embedded in
other contracts and for hedging  activities.  Under SFAS 133, certain  contracts
that were not formerly  considered  derivatives may now meet the definition of a
derivative.  The Company adopted SFAS 133 effective January 1, 2001.  Management
believes that the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a significant impact on the
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting  Bulletin  No. 101 ("SAB  101"),  "Revenue  Recognition  in Financial
Statements." SAB 101 summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally
accepted accounting  principles to revenue recognition in financial  statements.
The  adoption  of SAB 101 did not have an effect on the  Company's  consolidated
financial statements.

In March 2000, the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 44,  "Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation" ("FIN 44"). FIN 44, an interpretation
of APB 25, provides guidance on the application of APB 25 for stock compensation
involving  employees.  The  adoption  of FIN 44 did not  have an  effect  on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to financial market risks,  including changes in interest
rates and foreign  currency  exchange rates. The Company does not use derivative
financial  instruments  for any purpose.  Interest rate exposure is  principally
limited to the $2 million  current  portion of  long-term  debt  outstanding  at
December 31, 2000,  under the  Company's  line of credit  agreement.  Borrowings
under the line of credit  agreement  bear  interest at rates that float with the
market.  The impact of a 100 basis point change in the interest rate on the line
of credit agreement would not be material to earnings, cash flows or fair value.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated  financial statements,  the financial
statements of the Company's London sales office are remeasured into U.S. dollars
using the U.S.  dollar as the functional  currency.  The market risk  associated
with  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  is not  material  in  relation  to the
Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
        AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

On April 27, 2000,  Deloitte & Touche LLP was appointed as independent  auditors
for  the  Company,  replacing  Arthur  Andersen  LLP.  The  decision  to  change
accountants was approved by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company had no
disagreements  with Arthur Andersen LLP in the year ended December 31, 1999. The
Company filed a Form 8-K reporting the change in independent accountants.

NYFIX, Inc.
Stamford, Connecticut

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheet of NYFIX, Inc. and
subsidiary as of December 31, 2000, and the related  consolidated  statements of
operations,  shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These
consolidated  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards  generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management  as well as  evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audit  provides  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial  position of NYFIX, Inc. and subsidiary as of
December 31, 2000, and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for
the year then ended in conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

2.          SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

            Principles of Consolidation
            ---------------------------

            The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NYFIX,
            Inc. and its subsidiary.  All significant  intercompany balances and
            transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

            Use of Estimates
            ----------------

            The   preparation  of  financial   statements  in  conformity   with
            accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United  States of
            America  requires  management to make estimates and assumptions that
            affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  financial   statements  and
            accompanying   notes.   Actual   results  could  differ  from  those
            estimates.

            Reclassifications
            -----------------

            Certain 1999 and 1998 balances have been  reclassified to conform to
            the 2000 presentation.

            Cash and Cash Equivalents
            -------------------------

            The Company  considers all highly liquid  instruments  with original
            maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

            Inventory
            ---------

            Inventory  consists of parts,  finished  goods and  materials and is
            stated at the lower of cost, determined on an average cost basis, or
            market.

            Property and Equipment
            ----------------------

            Property  and   equipment   is  stated  at  cost  less   accumulated
            depreciation. Included in equipment are certain costs related to the
            development   of  the  NYFIX   network  to  support  the   Company's
            subscription and service based businesses.  Depreciation is provided
            using the  straight-line  method over the estimated  useful lives of
            the assets  ranging from two to eight years.  The  estimated  useful
            lives for subscription and service-based equipment are generally two
            to three years.

            Other Assets
            ------------

            Other  assets  consist  principally  of  patents,  deferred  product
            enhancements   costs   (capitalized   based  on  time  incurred  for
            enhancements   of  products   which  have   achieved   technological
            feasibility)  and  deposits.  Product  enhancement  costs  are being
            amortized using the  straight-line  method over three years.  Patent
            costs are being amortized over seventeen years.

            Long-Lived Assets
            -----------------

            Long-lived assets,  primarily  equipment and the investment in NYFIX
            Millennium   are  reviewed  for   impairment   whenever   events  or
            circumstances  indicate that the asset's undiscounted  expected cash
            flows are not sufficient to recover its carrying amount. The Company
            measures an impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset
            to its  carrying  amount.  The fair value of an asset is  calculated
            based upon the present  value of expected  future cash flows.  There
            has been no  impairment in long-lived  assets  through  December 31,
            2000.

            Revenue Recognition
            -------------------

            Sales are  generally  recorded  upon  shipment of the product to and
            acceptance by customers.  Subscription revenue is recognized ratably
            over the life of the subscription agreements with customers. Revenue
            from  service  contracts is  recognized  ratably over the period the
            services are  performed.  Amounts  billed in advance for service and
            subscription   contracts  are  deferred  and  reflected  as  advance
            billings.

            Research and Development
            ------------------------

            The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred.

            Advertising
            -----------

            The Company  expenses  advertising  costs as  incurred.  Advertising
            expense was  $170,000,  $159,000  and  $294,000  for the years ended
            December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

            Foreign Currency Translation
            ----------------------------

            The Company's  functional currency is the U.S. dollar.  Accordingly,
            the monetary  assets and  liabilities of the London sales office are
            translated at year-end exchange rates while non-monetary  assets and
            liabilities  are  translated  at  historical  rates.   Revenues  and
            expenses are  translated at average rates in effect during the year,
            except for depreciation  and cost of sales,  which are translated at
            historical rates. The resulting currency translation gain or loss is
            included in the results of operations.

            Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle
            -----------------------------------------------------

            In 1998,  the American  Institute of  Certified  Public  Accountants
            issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-5,  "Reporting on the Costs of
            Start-Up  Activities." The SOP requires costs of start-up activities
            and  organization  costs to be  expensed  as  incurred.  The Company
            adopted the SOP in 1999 and  recognized a charge for the  cumulative
            effect of accounting change of $42,000.

            Income Taxes
            ------------

            Deferred  income taxes have been provided for temporary  differences
            between the  Company's  financial  statement and income tax basis of
            the Company's  assets and liabilities  using  presently  enacted tax
            rates.

                                       24

            Financial Instruments
            ---------------------

            The carrying  value for all current  assets and current  liabilities
            approximates  fair value  because of their  short-term  nature.  The
            carrying value of the Company's long-term debt also approximates its
            fair value based on prevailing interest rates.

            Accrued Expenses
            ----------------

            Included in accrued  expenses is sales tax payable of $1,542,000 and
            $595,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

            Comprehensive Income
            --------------------

            For all  years  presented,  comprehensive  income  was  equal to net
            earnings.

            Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
            ---------------------------------------------------

            In June 1998,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")
            issued  SFAS  No.  133  ("SFAS  133"),   Accounting  for  Derivative
            Instruments  and Hedging  Activities.  SFAS 133 is effective for all
            fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2000.  SFAS 133, as amended,
            establishes   accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  derivative
            instruments,  including certain derivative  instruments  embedded in
            other contracts and for hedging activities.  Under SFAS 133, certain
            contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet
            the  definition  of a  derivative.  The  Company  adopted  SFAS  133
            effective January 1, 2001.  Management believes that the adoption of
            SFAS  133  will  not  have a  significant  impact  on the  financial
            position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.

            In December 1999, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")
            issued  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  No. 101 ("SAB  101"),  "Revenue
            Recognition in Financial  Statements." SAB 101 summarizes certain of
            the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles
            to revenue recognition in financial statements.  The adoption of SAB
            101 did not  have an  effect  on  Company's  consolidated  financial
            statements.

            In March 2000, the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 44,  "Accounting
            for Certain  Transactions  Involving Stock Compensation" ("FIN 44").
            FIN 44,  an  interpretation  of APB  25,  provides  guidance  on the
            application of APB 25 for stock  compensation  involving  employees.
            The  adoption  of FIN 44 did not  have an  effect  on the  Company's
            consolidated financial statements.

6.          EARNINGS PER SHARE

            The Company's  basic earnings per common share ("EPS") is calculated

            the  weighted-average   number  of  shares  outstanding  during  the
            reported  period.  Diluted EPS  includes  additional  dilution  from
            common stock  equivalents,  such as stock  issuable  pursuant to the
            exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants.

7.          CAPITAL STOCK

            On October  21,  1999,  shareholders  approved  an  increase  in the
            authorized  shares of the  Company's  common  and  preferred  stock.
            Common  shares were  increased to 60 million from 15 million  shares
            and preferred shares to 5 million from 1 million shares.  Along with
            this  increase,  the Board of  Directors  authorized a 3 for 2 stock
            split in the form of a 50% stock  dividend  to all  shareholders  of
            record on November 1, 1999,  which was paid on November 15, 1999. On
            March 13, 2000,  the Board of  Directors  authorized a 3 for 2 stock
            split in the form of a 50% stock  dividend  to all  shareholders  of
            record on March 24,  2000,  which was paid  April 4,  2000.  All per
            share and share data in the  consolidated  financial  statements and
            notes thereto have been restated to reflect the stock splits.

            On September 7, 1999, the Company  completed a private  placement of
            281,250 shares of common stock to an  institutional  investment firm
            at a price equal to the average  closing  price of the stock for the
            30-day  period prior to the closing date on September 1, 1999.  This
            approximated the fair market value of the stock at $9.0555 per share
            for an aggregate value of $2,546,875.

            On November 24, 1998, the Company  completed a private  placement of

            for an aggregate value of $3,600,000. Costs related to this offering
            amounted to  $150,000  resulting  in net  proceeds to the Company of
            $3,450,000.

            On September 1, 1997, the Board of Directors  declared a dividend of
            a preference  share purchase right (a "Right") for each  outstanding
            share of common stock of the Company held by  shareholders of record
            on  September  19,  1997.  Each share of common  stock issued by the
            Company after such record date has the same Right attached  thereto.
            Each Right  entitles  the  registered  holder to  purchase  from the
            Company, at any time after a shareholder acquires 20% or more of the
            Company's  outstanding  common  stock,  as set  forth in the  Rights
            Agreement,   shares  of  the  Company's  Series  A  Preferred  Stock
            ("Preference   Stock").   The   purchase   price   is  $40  per  one
            one-hundredth of a share of Preference Stock,  subject to adjustment
            as set forth in the Rights Agreement.

            During 2000, 495,000 warrants and 760,000 options were exercised for

            than 10% of total  revenues  or  accounts  receivable.  For the year
            ended  December 31, 1999,  one customer  accounted  for 13% of total
            revenues  and  another  customer   accounted  for  11%  of  accounts
            receivable.  For the  year ended  December  31, 1998,  one  customer

            accounts receivable.

9.          DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS

            On July 13, 1998,  the Company  entered into a three-year $3 million
            line  of  credit  agreement  (the   "Agreement")  with  a  financial
            institution with advances on such agreement available to the Company
            during  the first  eighteen  months.  The  Agreement  was  primarily
            intended to finance  equipment  expenditures.  The  Agreement  bears
            interest at either  LIBOR plus 1.25% or the bank's  prime rate.  The
            rate used is at the Company's  discretion.  The Company drew down an
            aggregate  of  $1,800,000  under the  Agreement  during  1998 and an
            additional  $700,000 during 1999. The weighted  average  outstanding
            borrowings during 2000 were  approximately  $2,398,000 at a weighted
            average  interest rate of 7.48%.  The weighted  average  outstanding
            borrowings  during  1999  were  $2,059,000  at  a  weighted  average
            interest rate of 7.43%.  The Agreement  prohibited  the Company from
            making principal  repayments prior to February 1, 2000. Repayment of
            principal   commenced  on  July  30,  2000,   with  twelve   monthly
            installments  of $83,333 with the remaining  balance due on July 30,
            2001. The debt is personally  secured by a non-employee  shareholder
            of

                                       27

<PAGE>

            the  Company  and the  Company's  president.  In  consideration  for
            securing the Agreement,  the non-employee  shareholder and president
            received 337,500 and 56,250 warrants,  respectively, to purchase the
            Company's common stock at approximately  $2.83 per share,  which was
            the  market  value of the  Company's  common  stock on the date such
            warrants were issued.  The expense related to the warrants issued is
            being recognized over the three-year term of the Agreement.

            In  association  with  obtaining  the  $3  million  line  of  credit
            facility,  the Company  terminated  its  previous  $500,000  line of
            credit agreement and repaid all outstanding term loans. The weighted
            average  outstanding  borrowing  under the previous  credit line was
            $74,000 during 1998 at a weighted average interest rate of 9.50%.

            At December 31, 2000, the Company was committed  under capital lease
            obligations  with  interest  rates  ranging from 8.28% to 13.04% for
            maturities  ranging from  January 2, 2003 to December  31, 2003.  At
            December 31, 2000, the amount of the obligation was $1,823,000, with

            exceed the federal  limit of $10,500 in 2000.  The Plan  permits the

            under the Plan are discretionary.  Total Company contributions under

The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes   option-pricing   model  with  the   following   weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 2000, 1999 and 1998:


o        Risk free interest rates range from 4.18% to 6.42%
o        Expected  dividend yields of 0%
o        Expected lives of 3 to 5 years and
o        Expected volatility of 70%, 65% and 63%, respectively

The  Company  applies  APB  Opinion  No.  25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees" and related  interpretations  to account for its stock plans.  Except
for certain warrants granted to non-employees  during 1998, no compensation cost
has been  recognized  for any  option  grants in the  accompanying  consolidated
statements of operations.  Had compensation  costs been determined in accordance
with  the  fair  value  method  as  defined  in SFAS No.  123,  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation",  the net  earnings  (loss)  and  basic  and  diluted
earnings (loss) per share would have been reduced from the following as reported
amounts to the following pro forma amounts:

14.         BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

            The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 131,
            "Disclosures   About   Segments   of  an   Enterprise   and  Related
            Information," which establishes  standards for additional disclosure
            about   operating   segments   for  interim  and  annual   financial
            statements.   This  standard  requires   financial  and  descriptive
            information  be disclosed for segments whose  operating  results are
            reviewed by the Company for  decisions  on resource  allocation.  It
            also establishes  standards for related  disclosures  about products
            and services, geographic areas and major customers.

            The  Company  operates in a single  industry  segment as a financial
            technology    company    focusing   on   electronic    trading   and
            straight-through  processing  solutions for the brokerage community.
            The Company has two principal product lines:  Equities and Futures &
            Options.  The Company's  Equities  product line is sold primarily by
            the Stamford and New York locations,  while the Company's  Futures &
            Options  product  line is sold  primarily  by the London and Chicago
            locations.  Each  office has the  opportunity  to sell or enter into
            subscriptions  for either of the Company's  product lines.  However,
            the  operations of each product line are not  individually  reported
            nor  are  they  managed  or  evaluated  individually  by  the  Chief
            Executive  Officer,  who is the Company's  chief decision  maker. As
            such, the Company does not segment its business by product line.

            Identifiable  assets by geographic  location include assets directly
            identifiable   with  those   locations.   Corporate  assets  consist
            primarily of cash and cash  equivalents and fixed assets  associated
            with non-operating activities.

            Summarized  financial  information by geographic  location for 2000,
1999 and 1998 is as follows (in 000's):

15.         INCOME TAXES

            Deferred  income  taxes  reflect  the net tax  effects of  temporary
            differences  between the carrying  amount of assets and  liabilities
            for financial  reporting purposes and the amount used for income tax
            purposes. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to
            significant  portions of the  deferred  tax assets and  deferred tax
            liability  recognized as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 are presented

            As of December 31, 1999,  the Company  established a full  valuation
            allowance  for its  deferred  tax  assets  based  upon  management's
            determination of the amount that would ultimately be realized. Based
            upon the continued  profitability of the Company during 2000 as well
            as  expected  future  profitability,  management  determined  as  of
            December  31,  2000,  that  a  valuation  allowance  was  no  longer
            required.

            At  December  31,  2000,   the  Company  had  net   operating   loss
            carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $3,776,000 expiring
            in  2014  through  2019.  In  addition,   the  net  operating   loss
            carryforwards  may be  significantly  limited  in the  future  under
            Internal  Revenue Code Section 382 as a result of ownership  changes
            resulting from the Company's equity offerings.

            The exercise of  non-qualified  stock options and the  disqualifying
            dispositions  of incentive  stock options under the Company's  stock
            option plans gives rise to  compensation  which is includable in the
            taxable  income of the  recipients and deductible by the Company for
            federal and state income tax  purposes.  The tax benefit  recognized
            from the utilization of such deductions increased paid-in capital by
            $2,635,000 during the year ended December 31, 2000.

18.         INVESTMENT IN NYFIX MILLENNIUM

            On October 27, 1999,  the Company  announced  the formation of NYFIX
            Millennium,  L.L.C.  ("NYFIX  Millennium") with seven  international
            investment banks and brokerage firms (the "Consortium"). The Company
            owns 50% of NYFIX  Millennium and the Consortium  owns the remaining
            50%. NYFIX Millennium  intends to operate as an alternative  trading
            system.  All of the  partners of the  Consortium,  and the  Company,
            invested  $2,000,000  each  in  NYFIX  Millennium.  Each  Consortium
            partner received 281,250 shares of common stock of the Company,  for
            an aggregate  1,968,750  shares,  in return for granting the Company
            the option to purchase up to an additional 30% of NYFIX  Millennium.
            The  Company may  exercise  the option  through the  exchange of one
            share of the Company's  common stock for each NYFIX  Millennium unit
            to be purchased,  subject to  adjustments in the event of any split,
            combination,  reclassification  or other  adjustments to the capital
            structure of the Company.  The Company's  total  investment in NYFIX
            Millennium of $19,500,000 consists of $17,500,000  (1,968,750 shares
            of  Company  stock x  $8.89)  and a  capital  cash  contribution  of
            $2,000,000.   Pursuant  to  the  Operating   Agreement,   the  first
            $14,000,000 in losses will be allocated to the Consortium investors,
            which  equals  the  extent  of  their  capital  investment  in NYFIX
            Millennium,  and no  portion  of those  losses  will be borne by the
            Company.  The Company has temporarily funded certain operating costs
            and capital  expenditures  on behalf of NYFIX  Millennium  until its
            operations  commence.  Such  costs are  reflected  as Due from NYFIX
            Millennium on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

            On March 14, 2001,  NYFIX  Millennium  added two new partners,  with
            additional  partners and funding expected in the near term. Pursuant
            to the terms of the Operating  Agreement of NYFIX  Millennium,  each
            new  partner  contributed  $2,000,000  to NYFIX  Millennium  and the
            Company maintained its 50% ownership interest in NYFIX Millennium in
            exchange  for  reducing  certain  of its  rights  to share in future
            dividend  distributions  of NYFIX  Millennium.  The  Company  issued
            94,000  shares of its common stock to each new partner in return for
            the same option rights noted above.

            The Company leases computer and office space to NYFIX  Millennium on
            a month-to-month basis pursuant to a management agreement with NYFIX
            Millennium.  Future  payments from NYFIX  Millennium for such leases
            are expected to be as follows:
