ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business

NYFIX, Inc. (the "Company" or "NYFIX") develops and markets advanced  electronic
trading systems to brokerage  firms,  international  banks and global  exchanges
trading in equities,  futures & options,  and  currencies.  The Company's  NYFIX
Network, a combined FIX (Financial  Information  Exchange protocol) and Exchange
Access Network, enables users to electronically communicate trade data among the
buy-side,  sell-side and exchange floor environments.  NYFIX is headquartered in
Stamford,  Connecticut and maintains operations in New York, Chicago and London.
The Company (formerly  Trinitech Systems,  Inc.) was incorporated in New York in
1991 and is listed on the Nasdaq Stock  Market  under the symbol NYFX.  Prior to
March 6, 2000,  the  Company's  common  stock was traded on the  American  Stock
Exchange  under the ticker symbol NYF.  Prior to October 25, 1999, the Company's
common stock was traded on the American  Stock  Exchange under the ticker symbol
TSI.

The  Company's  goal is to become the leading  provider of real-time  electronic
trade  entry  and  routing  systems  and  connectivity  services  to the  global
financial  services  industry.  The Company  offers its customers the ability to
enter and route orders and executions electronically from "end-to-end," from the
buy-side/retail  institution  or remote  branch  office  through to the exchange
floors and electronic exchanges.  The Company's technology is being used by such
major firms as Lehman Brothers,  Deutsche Bank, Warburg Dillon Read, ING Barings
and Merrill Lynch, among others.

The Company's systems provide  electronic order entry,  order routing,  tracking
and risk monitoring  capabilities,  replacing existing paper and telephone based
trading  and  eliminating  a number of  redundant  steps in the  order  flow and
execution  reporting process. As the financial industry continues to move from a
paper  and voice  driven  tracking  environment  to  real-time  electronic-based
trading,  management believes NYFIX is well positioned to take advantage of this
growing  trend.  Wall Street  firms are  recognizing  the ability of  electronic
trading  systems to  enhance  order and  information  flow and  improve  trading
performance by eliminating trading errors and providing on-line risk management,
in  addition  to the  cost  efficiencies  associated  with  electronic  trading.
Numerous trading  scandals have provided further impetus for the  implementation
of  electronic   trading   systems  with  risk  monitoring  and  audit  tracking
capabilities by financial risk managers.

In September  1997, the Company  launched its NYFIX Network,  a FIX and Exchange
Access  Network  designed  to provide  the  financial  community  with a central
electronic  meeting place for routing  real-time  orders and other FIX messages.
NYFIX provides the Company's equities customers access to its subscription-based
quote,  order and execution  routing  systems as well as providing  connectivity
between the buy-side,  sell-side  and exchange  floor  environments  through the
industry  standard  protocol,  FIX. NYFIX offers  financial firms the ability to
utilize  the  Company's  systems  without  having to invest in a  communications
infrastructure.   Furthermore,  the  Company's  NYFIX  Data  Centers  offer  the
potential for an "any to any"  relationship  for routing  orders and  executions
between and among firms,  various exchanges and alternative sources of liquidity
including  Electronic  Communications  Networks  (ECNs).  The  Company  has made
considerable progress implementing its  subscription-based  NYFIX business model
throughout  1999 and  management  believes  the Company is well  positioned  for
further growth in 2000.  NYFIX continues to provide the financial  industry with
complete systems,  including the raw terminals (hardware manufactured by NYFIX),
the software and the infrastructure  (through its NYFIX Data Centers) to tie the
trading  industry  together for the  electronic  entry and routing of orders and
executions.

All of the Company's products are available in flexible building blocks that can
be sold as  complete  systems or  separately  to  complement  existing  customer
components.  This has given the Company the ability to collect revenue from each
"link" of the trading process.  The Company also continues to expand and enhance
its  product  portfolio  with  new  and   complementary   software  modules  and
connectivity  services  that allow the Company to collect  revenue from multiple
levels.  The Company offers its trading  systems on a subscription  basis,  with
hardware, software and maintenance provided for a monthly fee. For the Company's
customers,  this pricing model offers minimal up-front  investment in technology
as well as an alternative to costly in-house  development.  For the Company,  it
offers a  simplification  of the sales  cycle as well as  significant  recurring
revenue.  From time to time, the Company does offer


                                       2
<PAGE>
certain products (such as a custom  enhancement) for a one-time fee. The Company
as a whole is moving away from its previous  capital  sales model and now offers
its systems, including the entire NYFIX product line, on a subscription basis.

NYFIX Millennium, L.L.C.
In October of 1999,  the Company  announced the  formation of NYFIX  Millennium,
L.L.C. ("NYFIX Millennium"), which is a joint venture between NYFIX and Deutsche
Bank,  ING Barings,  Lehman  Brothers,  Morgan  Stanley Dean Witter,  Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co.,  Inc.,  SG Cowen  Securities  and Warburg  Dillon  Read.  NYFIX
Millennium is an "Integrated  Alternative Trading System (ATS),  Exchange Access
and Intelligent  `Best Execution'  Order-Routing  System." NYFIX Millennium will
provide  a  state-of-the  art  execution   facility  for  both  listed  and  OTC
securities. NYFIX Millennium is referred to as a Hybrid Market System because it
combines the  electronic  execution  technology  of an ECN with the liquidity of
traditional primary markets. Through real-time matching and automatic forwarding
of unexecuted orders to the primary exchange markets,  NYFIX Millennium plans to
provide traders  unparalleled  access to liquidity.  NYFIX  Millennium  plans to
generate     transaction-oriented     revenue    by     providing     documented
"Price-Improvement"  executions through its ATS and "Intelligent  Order-routing"
functions.  NYFIX  Millennium  plans to operate as a Broker/Dealer in compliance
with Regulation ATS and its Broker/Dealer  application is currently on file with
the SEC. The NYFIX  Millennium ATS is currently  under  development  with formal
launch slated in the second half of 2000.

                                    Products

Portfolio  of Complete  Electronic  Trading  Systems  NYFIX  supplies  complete,
standardized  trading solutions that consist of hardware,  proprietary  software
packages  and  network  technology  for the  trading of  equities  and futures &
options.  In  addition,  the Company  supports  its  customers in all aspects of
planning and implementing  these systems as well as providing on-going technical
support.

The Company has two principal business groups: The Equities Group and the Future
& Options  Group.  Each group has built its  business and  technical  management
staff with  expert  knowledge  so that their  individual  product  segments  are
efficiently targeted to their respective customers.  The Equities Group operates
primarily out of the Company's  Stamford and New York offices and the Future and
Options  Group  operates  primarily  out of the  Company's  London  and  Chicago
offices. However, each location has the opportunity to sell all of the Company's
products.

Equities Group-Products
The Company has developed eight systems for equities trading:
1.          Market Looks System
2.          FloorReport
3.          FIXTrader
4.          NYFIX Network Services
5.          Breakwatch
6.          TradeWatch
7.          NYFIX HandHeld
8.          Nasdaq Trader Interface

The NYFIX Market Looks System consists of the Trinitech Touchpad(R),  a scanner,
server and  proprietary  software.  The  touchpad was designed by the Company to
simplify and expedite the entry of orders and information related to the trading
of financial  instruments.  The  Trinitech  Touchpad(R),  with its patented flat
panel design,  was  developed to optimize  critical  trader/broker  desktop real
estate. Its proprietary open architecture  offers seamless  integration with all
major industry  operating  systems,  thereby allowing customers to freely choose
between  the most  popular  operating  systems.  The  Market  Looks  Systems  is
comprised of two  complementary  software  modules:  FloorLook  for the exchange
floor booth and  ImageViewer  for the upstairs  trader  workstation.  The Market
Looks System  solves the  challenge  faced by member firms in getting  real-time
quotes or "looks" on stocks  directly from the exchange floor to


                                       3
<PAGE>
firms' upstairs trading operations. The Market Looks System operates by scanning
handwritten  quote slips called  "looks" into a scanner by a floor clerk located
at the member's booth. These scanned looks are instantly transmitted to upstairs
traders  at  their   workstations   in  multiple   sites  and  remote   offices.
Implementation of the system results in the elimination of repetitive  telephone
traffic  between clerks and traders.  The Market Looks System helps firms reduce
errors and disseminate information more efficiently.

The NYFIX  FloorReport  System is a complete  electronic order management system
designed  for member  firms'  exchange  floor  operations.  Orders are  received
electronically  from upstairs  traders (via the FIX  Protocol),  with  execution
information routed back in the same efficient manner.  FloorReport enables floor
clerks to route  execution  information to sales and block traders in real time,
enabling them to better service their customers. FloorReport organizes orders in
a central  blotter,  helping clerks by tracking status and  calculating  average
price in real-time.

The NYFIX FIXTrader  System is a complete order  management  system for upstairs
traders,  which allows the electronic entry and routing of orders and executions
between buy-side institutions,  sales and block desks and exchange floor booths.
Traders enter orders quickly and  efficiently  through a Touchpad(R) (or a mouse
and keyboard  configuration)  and which are then routed to the appropriate venue
in seconds,  with executions routed back in the same efficient manner.  With the
financial  industry's adoption of FIX as the standard protocol for communicating
electronically,  FIXTrader  offers an easy way for firms to gain FIX compliance.
FIXTrader enables firms to receive orders from  electronically from the buy-side
as well as connect to back office systems helping firms achieve straight-through
processing.

The NYFIX  Network is a  Combined  FIX and  Exchange  Access  Network  that link
various  companies   throughout  the  financial   industry  for  the  electronic
communication of trade information.  Connecting  buy-side,  brokerage,  exchange
floor booths and various exchange  systems,  NYFIX is a private,  secure network
designed  to  provide  firms  with  secure and  reliable  transmission  of their
electronic  trade  information.  NYFIX  provides a number of benefits to clients
including  reduced cost  compared to  maintaining  one's own network,  increased
routing options and network management ensuring connectivity between parties.

Breakwatch is NYFIX's  application for identifying  intra-day trade errors. This
program helps firms identify potential trading errors,  giving firms a chance to
rectify  mistakes on the day the trade takes place.  Breakwatch  also provides a
link into the OCS system,  simplifying reporting as per exchange trade reporting
requirements.

TradeWatch  is NYFIX's  application  for  monitoring  an entire  trading  desk's
positions. This application,  used by head traders and/or risk managers, enables
management to keep apprised of all the trading  desk's  positions by integrating
data from all of the firm's FIXTrader workstations.

The NYFIX  HandHeld  is the  Company's  Market  Looks  System,  which  runs on a
handheld computer. This wireless, lightweight computer is used by exchange floor
brokers to transmit  looks from the  specialist  to their booth and  directly to
traders'   workstations.   Battery-powered,   the  NYFIX  HandHeld  enables  the
simultaneous  transmission  of looks to  multiple  traders  as well as  enabling
traders to receive  looks  directly from "the crowd" on the trading  floor.  The
Handheld  units were rolled out during the first  quarter of 2000.  This rollout
represents a  productivity  pilot,  which will determine the final rollout phase
for the remainder of 2000.

NYFIX' Nasdaq Trader Interface is an application  designed to accommodate  order
management  and  routing for the Nasdaq  marketplace.  Level II  compliant,  the
Nasdaq Trader Interface will enable traders to communicate  electronically  with
the Nasdaq  market.  The Nasdaq Trader  Interface  will be rolled out during the
first quarter of 2000. This rollout represents a productivity  pilot, which will
determine the final rollout phase for the remainder of 2000.

During  1999,  the  Company  enhanced  its  product  line by  adding a number of
auxiliary services,  such as increased connectivity options and linkages as well
as  increased  functionality.  Product  development  continues  to be focused on
adding more  features to the  Company's  existing  product  line,  accommodating
customer requests.

Product Pricing-Equities Group
All of NYFIX'  products for equities  trading are sold on a subscription  basis,
with hardware, software and maintenance provided for a monthly subscription fee.
Subscription  agreements  usually run from one to three  years,  with  automatic
multiple  year  renewal  provisions  included.  Products are priced on a monthly
basis per terminal.

Product Penetration-Equities Group
Building upon the Data Center  established  in late 1996,  the Company  launched
NYFIX,  its combined FIX and Exchange  Access  Network,  in September  1997. The
Network and data center,  strategically located several blocks from the New York
Stock  Exchange,  offers easy  monthly  subscription-based  access to all of the
Company's quote,  order and execution  routing  systems.  The NYFIX Network also
allows  smaller  "two-dollar"  and  independent  brokers access to the Company's
systems.  Firms no longer need a  communications  infrastructure  to utilize the
Company's systems, as they can simply subscribe to the service. During 1999, the
Company  has  continued  to invest in the NYFIX data  center  infrastructure  to
accommodate customer needs and growth of the service.

Futures and Options Group-Products
For the futures & options  trading  market,  the Company markets its Futures and
Options Order Book Management System ("OBMS"), which enables futures and options
traders to enter,  route and manage orders and  executions in real-time.  Global
order routing between different  international branches of the same firm and all
the major global exchanges, both open outcry and electronic is supported by this
comprehensive system. OBMS is offered utilizing the Company's patented Trinitech
Touchpad(R) or in stand-alone software versions.

Product Pricing-Futures and Options Group
The Company offers OBMS on a subscription or transaction  basis,  with hardware,
software and  maintenance  provided for a monthly fee.  Subscription  agreements
usually  run  from one to three  years  with  automatic  multiple  year  renewal
provisions included.  When OBMS is sold on a transaction basis, the Company will
receive a fee per futures  contract  traded through the system with a guaranteed
monthly minimum payment.

Product Penetration-Futures and Options Group
OBMS has been  utilized  by a number of leading  firms in the  futures & options
industry,  including CS First Boston,  Dresdner  Kleinwort  Benson,  and Merrill
Lynch, among others.

                                    Marketing

Electronic Trading Systems
The Company  believes that the financial  trading  industry  represents an ideal
example  of  a  uniform  niche  market.  The  characteristics  of  this  market,
particularly  its low level of  automation  at the  trade-entry  or  deal-making
level, provide an excellent  opportunity for the marketing of cost-effective and
innovative technical solutions. The Company believes that this market is clearly
defined, readily accessible,  and accustomed to technological  adjustment.  As a
single,  coherent  community,  the trading industry allows the Company to market
standardized  products in a uniform  manner in each of its market  segments  for
equities and futures & options  trading on a global basis.  Management  believes
the  Company's  offering of  products on a  subscription  or  transaction  basis
through a data center  solution  will  significantly  aid in the roll-out of its
products  on an  industry-wide  basis,  opening up new market  segments  for the
Company's products.

The Company continued its aggressive marketing efforts in 1999 and increased its
global   presence  by   exhibiting   its  products  at  numerous   domestic  and
international  technology and financial industry  conferences.  The Company also
generated  significant  press coverage with respect to its FIX trading solutions
and industry  wide FIX and exchange  connectivity  network,  NYFIX.  The Company
intends to continue its marketing initiatives in 2000.

                                   Competition

Electronic Trading Systems
Competition exists in the Company's primary market. The Company believes that it
competes favorably with its trading systems, gaining additional leverage through
optimized  integration  of  NYFIX's  advanced  systems  and its large  number of
connectivity  options. To further enhance the marketability of its systems,  the
Company is implementing  its solutions on the most popular and  well-established
client server architectures.

The Company believes that its technology  offers unique  advantages  compared to
alternative  technologies utilized by competitors.  The Company believes,  based
upon customer feedback,  that its systems  successfully fulfill their promise of
immediate  entry,  routing  and  reporting  of  trading  positions,  operational
savings,  reduction of input error and  improvement  in reporting for compliance
purposes.

The  Company  also  believes  that its  management  and staff  have an  in-depth
knowledge of the  inner-workings  of trading  rooms,  exchange  floors,  and the
overall  marketplace,  thus  facilitating its ability to serve client needs with
technological hardware and software adaptations.

                               Product Production

The Company designs, develops and produces its proprietary software and hardware
products at its facility in Stamford,  Connecticut. The Company is not dependent
upon any one  supplier,  vendor or  subcontractor  for any of its  manufacturing
components.

Rule 123 Amendment
NYFIX is aware of amendments on file with the SEC to change certain  regulations
governing the recording and transmission of orders to and on the NYSE floor. The
first phase of such regulations  calls for all orders received on the NYSE floor
to be input into an electronic order management system for better monitoring and
tracking of trades.  The second phase calls for all orders to the exchange to be
sent  electronically.   The  Company  believes  this  regulation  is  positively
impacting  NYFIX's  business.  The Company already  produces  systems capable of
meeting and exceeding  regulatory  requirements  with many  additional  features
designed to reduce errors and maximize customer efficiency.  Management believes
that  this  "regulatory  push"  continues  to  provide  NYFIX  an  even  greater
opportunity  to  capture  market  share  both on the  exchange  floor and on the
upstairs trading desks.

                                    Employees

As of March 17, 2000 the Company had 80 full-time employees.


                    Risk Factors: Forward Looking Statements

The management discussion and analysis and the information provided elsewhere in
this Form 10-K contain forward looking statements regarding the Company's future
plans,  objectives  and  expected  performance.  Those  statements  are based on
assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable,  but are subject to a wide
range of risks  and  uncertainties,  and a number  of  factors  could  cause the
Company's  actual  results  to differ  materially  from those  expressed  in the
forward  looking  statements  referred to above.  These factors  include,  among
others, the Company's ability to further penetrate the financial services market
with a full range of the Company's products and the highly competitive market in
which the Company operates.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following  discussion and analysis  should be read in  conjunction  with the
consolidated  financial  statements  and notes thereto.  Historical  results and
percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of the operating results
for any future period.

The Company  commenced its present  business  operations in January 1991 through
the acquisition of a software license for its  Guided-Input(R)  Touchpad system.
Since  that time,  the  Company  has  transitioned  from a hardware  vendor to a
software  development  company  focusing  exclusively  on  applications  for the
financial  marketplace.  The  Company  provides a complete  line of  workstation
products for the  financial  trading desk  environment  and its systems  provide
order  management and routing  software for firms engaged in financial  trading.
During 1999 the Company achieved its first full year of profitability  since the
launch  of its NYFIX  subscription  business  model in late  1997.  The  Company
currently offers its trading products (integrated systems including hardware and
software) together with linkage through its NYFIX data center.

The  data  center  is  a  communication   infrastructure  known  as  the  "NYFIX
network"enabling  the Company to provide its  customers  with global  electronic
connectivity  for order  routing  and  allows  NYFIX to deploy and  monitor  its
systems and  services  from a single  location.  Customers  subscribe to various
products,  paying  a  monthly  fee per  terminal  for the  Company's  integrated
software  systems.  Most  contracts  provide the customer with a basic system or
infrastructure,  via the Company's NYFIX data center and are entered into by the
customer with the intention to expand the level of services  subscribed to, once
the basic  system  and  infrastructure  are  operational.  Subscription  revenue
contracts are  generally  for an initial  period of one or two years with one to
three year renewal periods.  The Company begins recording  subscription  revenue
once installation is complete.

Management has continued to apply a considerable  effort to the expansion of its
operations and the  development of various  product  enhancements to its trading
systems. The development of the NYFIX network has enabled the Company to improve
its  market  share.  The  Company  believes  that its  expansion  of  personnel,
facilities,  product portfolio and  subscription-based  model has positioned the
Company for steady future growth.

On October 27, 1999,  the Company  announced the  formation of NYFIX  Millennium
L.L.C.  ("NYFIX  Millennium")  with a consortium of seven leading  international
investment  banks and brokerage  firms.  NYFIX  Millennium is  registering  as a
Broker/Dealer  and plans to operate in compliance  with  Regulation  ATS.  NYFIX
Millennium  is  an  "Integrated  ATS,  Exchange  Access  and  Intelligent  `Best
Execution'  Order-Routing  System"  designed to provide the financial  community
with "Best-Execution." NYFIX Millennium is built upon NYFIX's proprietary "Super
FIX  Engine"  technology  and  existing  NYFIX  network  infrastructure.   NYFIX
Millennium is a Hybrid Market System  leveraging  new  regulation and technology
with the power of the traditional markets.

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998

Revenues
Subscription  revenue for 1999 exceeded the Company's  total revenue  recognized
during 1998. The increase in subscription sales is partly due to a number of new
products  enhancements and order routing services introduced during 1999 as well
as the Company's continued increase in new orders.

Consistent with the Company's  objectives,  recurring revenue has generally been
increasing on a quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis. Recurring contractual
revenue  is  accounting  for a greater  share of the  Company's  total  revenue.
Recurring  contractual revenue is comprised of subscription  revenue and service
contracts.   Recurring   contractual   revenue  for  the  Company  increased  by
approximately  137% for the year ended  December  31, 1999 (from  $3,582,000  to
$8,494,000) over the comparable 1998 period.  During the year ended December 31,
1999, subscription revenues and service contracts were approximately 79% and 21%
of  recurring  contractual  revenue,  respectively,  as compared to 64% and 36%,
respectively,  during the  comparable  1998  period.  The  increase in recurring
contractual revenue is due principally to the Company's strategy of offering its
products and services on a subscription  basis rather than capital sales coupled
with increased service agreements.

Sales revenue is comprised of software sales and capital equipment sales.  Sales
revenue  for the  Company  increased  by  approximately  40% for the year  ended
December  31,  1999  over  the  comparable  1998  period  (from   $2,653,000  to
$3,715,000). During the year ended December 31, 1999, software sales and capital
equipment   revenue  were   approximately   81%  and  19%  of  sales   revenues,
respectively,  as compared to 61% and 39%,  respectively,  during the year ended
December  31,  1998.  The increase in sales  revenue is due  principally  to the
demand  of  its  OBMS   (derivatives)   products.   Revenue  from  export  sales
approximated  $733,000  (approximately  6% of  revenue)  during  the year  ended
December 31, 1999 as compared to  approximately  $234,000  (approximately  4% of
revenue) during the comparable period in 1998.

Total revenue for the Stamford/New York location increased by approximately 121%
for the year ended  December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended December 31,
1998.  This  increase  was  principally  due to increased  subscription  revenue
recognized  throughout 1999. Total revenue for the London location  increased by
approximately  32% for the year ended December 31, 1999 over the comparable 1998
period.  This  increase  was  primarily  due to an increase  in software  sales,
partially offset by a decrease in hardware sales.  Total revenue for the Chicago
location increased by approximately 823% for the year ended December 31, 1999 as
compared to the year ended  December 31, 1998 (from  $31,000 to  $286,000).  The
increase   was   directly   attributable   to  the   growth  of  the   Company's
subscription-based business model.

Cost of Sales and Service and Gross Profit
The Company's cost of recurring contracts and sales are principally comprised of
labor, materials,  overhead,  subscription  communication lines, amortization of
capitalized  product  enhancement  costs and depreciation of  subscription-based
equipment.  Gross profit, as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 69%
and 59%  during  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  The  increase  in gross  profit
percentage  experienced by the Company during fiscal 1999  principally  resulted
from an  increase  in the amount of higher  margin  software  installations  and
subscription  agreements.  The Company obtains its materials and supplies from a
variety of vendors in the US and Far East.  During  1999,  the  Company  did not
experience any significant  price  increases in its component  parts  purchased.
Included in cost of sales is amortization  expense for product enhancement costs
of  approximately  $719,000 and $479,000 for 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  Also
included  in  cost of  sales  is  depreciation  expense  for  subscription-based
equipment   of   approximately   $586,000   and  $291,000  for  1999  and  1998,
respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative
During fiscal 1999, selling,  general and administrative  expenses increased 20%
(from  $5,494,000  to  $6,587,000)  when  compared  to fiscal  year 1998.  These
increases  reflect the continued  expansion of the development teams both in the
U.S.  and in  London.  The  expansion  in  development  efforts  relates  to the
Company's plans of providing an increased  number of new and enhanced  services.
These  services  relate to offering  subscription  and  transaction-based  order
routing, via the Company's data center, to multiple  exchange-floors and between
the "Buy-side" and "Sell-side"



                                       10

industry. As a result, the Company experienced increases in salaries and related
personnel costs,  travel expenses and various office  expenses.  During the past
three  years  the  Company  added   personnel   principally  to  its  technical,
programming,  service,  support and accounting  staff.  During 1999, the Company
added 25 new employees. The Company's recruitment effort continues to strengthen
the Company's  infrastructure  and position the Company to respond to increasing
market and revenue  opportunities.  The Company,  during the past several years,
has spent a considerable effort in developing and enhancing a variety of "trader
desk-top" and  "exchange-floor"  trading systems.  Management  believes that the
continued  investment  in  development  of the new NYFIX  data  center,  and its
services,  are designed to better leverage the existing  products  together with
providing  additional  sources of revenue.  The Company  decreased its marketing
programs  during 1999 from 1998 and will continue to market its products in 2000
however;  a greater  emphasis  will be placed  on its newer  products  & product
enhancements.  Research and development (new explorative  research) expenses for
the year  ended  December  31,  1999 and 1998 were  approximately  $297,000  and
$537,000, respectively, (a decrease of 45%) and are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses.

Depreciation
Depreciation  expense increased by approximately 45% for the year ended December
31, 1999 over the  comparable  1998 period  (from  $457,000 to  $663,000).  Such
increases   principally  reflect  the  continued  investment  in  the  Company's
infrastructure in its NYFIX data center on Wall Street.

Other (Expense) Income
Financing and interest expense  increased in fiscal 1999 principally  because of
higher balances  outstanding on the Company's new line of credit and the cost of
warrants issued to a non-employee  for the guarantee of the amounts  outstanding
under the credit facility.

Other income  includes  interest  income and other  miscellaneous  non-operating
items.  Interest  income in 1999 and 1998  approximated  $113,000  and  $92,000,
respectively.  The 20% increase in interest  income was  principally  because of
higher  average cash balances  maintained  by the Company  during the year ended
December 31, 1999 versus the comparable period in 1998.

Net Earnings/(Loss)
Net  earnings  for  fiscal  1999 was  approximately  $960,000  ($0.07 per share)
compared  to a net loss of  $2,234,000  ($0.17 per share) for fiscal  1998.  The
change in profitability  resulted from the increase in subscription type revenue
and the increase in software capital sales.  See "Revenues",  "Cost of Sales and
Service and Gross Profit" and "Selling, General and Administrative" above.

Management  continues to make a considerable effort with respect to expansion of
its operations,  development of various trading systems, which began in 1993 and
continues   into  1999  and  changes  to  its  business   model  to  that  of  a
subscription-based product offering. The Company believes that this expansion of
personnel,  facilities,  product  portfolio  and  subscription-based  model  has
positioned the Company for future growth.

At December 31, 1999, the Company had net operating loss carryforward balance of
approximately   $4,300,000,   which  expire   between   2014  and  2019.   These
carryforwards  may be  significantly  limited under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended,  as a result of ownership changes resulting from the Company's
equity  offerings.  A  valuation  allowance  of  approximately   $2,010,300  was
established  at December 31, 1999 to offset any benefit  from the net  operating
loss carryforwards.

Year Ended December 31, 1998 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1997

Revenues
The  increase  in  revenues  for the  year  ended  December  31,  1998  over the
comparable  1997  period  was  principally  due to the  Company's  changing  its
strategy to electronic  order routing which it began  executing in late 1997. In
addition to the conversion from capital sales to subscription sales, a number of
new  products  and  order  routing   services   under  the  NYFIX  umbrella  are
contributing to the Company's continued increase in new orders and corresponding
recurring revenues.

Consistent with the Company's  objectives,  recurring revenue has generally been
increasing on a quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis. Recurring contractual
revenue  is  accounting  for a greater  share of the  Company's  total  revenue.
Recurring  contractual revenue is comprised of subscription  revenue and service
contracts.   Recurring   contractual   revenue  for  the  Company  increased  by
approximately  172% for the year ended  December  31, 1998 (from  $1,318,000  to
$3,582,000) over the comparable 1997 period.  During the year ended December 31,
1998, subscription revenues and service contracts were approximately 64% and 36%
of  recurring  contractual  revenue,  respectively,  as compared to 21% and 79%,
respectively,  during the  comparable  1997  period.  The  increase in recurring
contractual revenue is due principally to the Company's strategy of offering its
products and services on a subscription  basis rather than capital sales coupled
with increased service agreements.

Sales revenue is comprised of capital equipment sales and software sales.  Sales
revenue  for the  Company  decreased  by  approximately  28% for the year  ended
December  31,  1998  over  the  comparable  1997  period  (from   $3,688,000  to
$2,653,000).  During the year ended December 31, 1998,  capital  equipment sales
and  software  revenue  were  approximately  39%  and  61%  of  sales  revenues,
respectively,  as compared to 66% and 34%,  respectively,  during the year ended
December  31,  1997.  The decrease in sales  revenue is due  principally  to the
Company's strategy of offering its products and services on a subscription basis
rather than  capital  sales.  Revenue from export  sales  approximated  $234,000
(approximately  4% of  revenue)  during  the year  ended  December  31,  1998 as
compared to approximately  $1,283,000  (approximately 26% of revenue) during the
comparable period in 1997. During fiscal 1998, sales to two customers  accounted
for approximately 26% of total revenue.

Total revenue for the Stamford/New York location  increased by approximately 19%
for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31,
1997. This increase was  principally  due to higher levels of  subscription  and
service revenue  partially offset by a decrease in sales revenue  resulting from
the  Company's  efforts to market its products on a  subscription  basis.  Total
revenue for the London  location  increased  by  approximately  55% for the year
ended December 31, 1998 over the comparable 1997 period.  This increase was also
due to higher  levels of  subscription  and  service  revenue  together  with an
increase in software  sales,  partially  offset by a decrease in hardware sales.
Total revenue for the Chicago location  decreased by  approximately  81% for the
year ended  December  31, 1998 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1997
(from $167,000 to $31,000). The decrease was directly attributable to the change
in  the  Company's   business  model  from  capital  sales  to  an  emphasis  on
subscription-based revenue.

Cost of Sales and Service and Gross Profit
The Company's cost of recurring contracts and sales are principally comprised of
labor, materials,  overhead,  subscription  communication lines, amortization of
capitalized  product  enhancement  costs and depreciation of  subscription-based
equipment.  Gross profit, as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 59%
and 46%  during  1998 and  1997,  respectively.  The  increase  in gross  profit
percentage  experienced by the Company during fiscal 1998  principally  resulted
from an  increase  in the amount of higher  margin  software  installations  and
subscription  agreements.  The Company obtains its materials and supplies from a
variety of vendors in the US and Far East.  During  1998,  the  Company  did not
experience any significant  price  increases in its component  parts  purchased.
Included in cost of sales is amortization  expense for product enhancement costs
of  approximately  $479,000 and $373,000 for 1998 and 1997,  respectively.  Also
included  in  cost of  sales  is  depreciation  expense  for  subscription-based
equipment   of   approximately   $291,000   and  $111,000  for  1998  and  1997,
respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative
During fiscal 1998, selling,  general and administrative  expenses increased 14%
(from  $4,830,000  to  $5,494,000)  when  compared  to fiscal  year 1997.  These
increases  reflect the continued  expansion of the development teams both in the
U.S.  and in  London.  The  expansion  in  development  efforts  relates  to the
Company's  plans of providing an increased  number of new  additional  services.
These  services  relate to offering  subscription  and  transaction-based  order
routing, via the Company's data center, to multiple  exchange-floors and between
the "Buy-side" and "Sell-side"  industry.  As a result, the Company  experienced
increases in salaries and related  personnel costs,  travel expenses and various
office  expenses.  During  the  past  two  years  the  Company  added  personnel
principally  to its  technical,  programming,  service,  support and  accounting
staff. During 1998, the Company added 7 new employees. The Company's recruitment
effort  continues to strengthen  the Company's  infrastructure  and position the
Company to respond to increasing market and revenue opportunities.  The Company,
during the past several years,  has spent a considerable  effort in developing a
variety of "trader desk-top" and  "exchange-floor"  trading systems.  Management
believes that the investment in  development  of the new NYFIX data center,  and
its services,  are designed to better  leverage the existing  products  together
with  providing  additional  sources of revenue.  The Company has  continued its
marketing  programs in 1998 primarily  focusing on public relations  activities,
production of various product  brochures,  and  representation  at technological
exhibitions  planned  throughout  the year.  The Company will continue to expand
these programs during 1999. Research and development (new explorative  research)
expenses  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998 and 1997  were  approximately
$537,000 and  $322,000,  respectively,  (an increase of 67%) and are included in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Depreciation
Depreciation expense increased by approximately 145% for the year ended December
31, 1998 over the  comparable  1997 period  (from  $186,000 to  $457,000).  Such
increases   principally  reflect  the  continued  investment  in  the  Company's
infrastructure in its state of the art NYFIX data center on Wall Street.

Other (Expense) Income
Financing and interest expense  increased in fiscal 1998 principally  because of
higher balances  outstanding on the Company's new line of credit and the cost of
warrants issued to a non-employee  for the guarantee of the amounts  outstanding
under the credit facility.

Other income  includes  interest  income and other  miscellaneous  non-operating
items.  Interest  income in 1998 and 1997  approximated  $92,000  and  $133,000,
respectively.  The 31% decrease in interest  income was  principally  because of
lower  average cash  balances  maintained  by the Company  during the year ended
December 31, 1998 versus the comparable  period in 1997. The Company  previously
leased a portion of its corporate  office facility under a three-year  sublease,
which expired on April 30, 1997. Due to the continuing  expansion of operations,
(see "Selling, General and Administrative" above) the Company has decided not to
renew the  sublease  and  incorporated  such space into its  existing  corporate
facility. Sublease rental income earned during 1997 approximated $13,000.

Net Loss
Net loss for fiscal 1998 was $2,234,000 ($0.17 per share) compared to a net loss
of  $2,594,000  ($0.21  per share) for fiscal  1997.  The  decrease  in net loss
principally  resulted  from the  increase in  subscription  type revenue and the
increase in software capital sales.  See "Revenues",  "Cost of Sales and Service
and Gross Profit" and "Selling, General and Administrative" above.

Management  has made a  considerable  effort with respect to an expansion of its
operations,  development  of various  trading  systems,  which began in 1993 and
continues   into  1998  and  changes  to  its  business   model  to  that  of  a
subscription-based product offering. The Company believes that this expansion of
personnel,  facilities,  product  portfolio  and  subscription-based  model will
better position the Company and facilitate its future growth.  However, in spite
of its optimism,  management is also  cautioning  that the Company's  aggressive
conversion  from a capital  sales model to  subscription-based  model is causing
revenue recognition from subscription-based  orders to be realized over a longer
period of time than the previous capital sales model.

At December  31,  1998,  the Company had net  operating  loss carry  forwards of
approximately  $5,270,000,  which  expire  between  2008 and 2013.  These  carry
forwards may be  significantly  limited under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, as a result of ownership changes resulting from the Company's equity
offerings.   A  valuation   allowance  of

                                       13
<PAGE>
approximately $2,400,000 has been established at December 31, 1998 to offset any
benefit from the net operating loss carry  forwards,  as it cannot be determined
when or if the Company will be able to utilize the net operating losses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's primary source of liquidity has been equity capital and draw downs
from  its  line of  credit.  In  November  of 1998  NYFIX  raised  approximately
$3,450,000 and in September of 1999 raised approximately $2,547,000 from private
placements of its securities.  At December 31, 1999, cash balances  decreased to
$1,566,000  from  $3,948,000  at December 31, 1998 as a result of the  Company's
working  capital  needs  and  continued  desire  to  strengthen  its  NYFIX  and
subscription infrastructure.

The Company at December 31, 1999 had total debt of $2,500,000,  which represents
amounts drawn down from its line of credit.  See discussion  below. In addition,
at December  31,  1999,  the Company  had no  material  commitments  for capital
expenditures or inventory purchases.

On July 13,  1998,  the Company  entered  into a  three-year  $3 million line of
credit agreement (the "Agreement") with a financial institution with advances on
such  agreement  available  to the  Company  during  the  first 18  months.  The
Agreement  is  primarily  intended  to finance  existing  and  future  equipment
expenditures.  The  Agreement  bears  interest at either LIBOR plus 1.25% or the
Bank's Prime rate. The rate used is  management's  discretion.  The Company drew
down  an  aggregate  of  $1,800,000  under  the  agreement  during  1998  and an
additional  $700,000  during  August of 1999.  The  Agreement  requires  monthly
payments of interest only until January 30, 2000.  Principal drawdowns under the
Agreement cannot be prepaid in the first eighteen months. Repayment of principal
commences on July 30, 2000 with twelve monthly  installments of $83,333 with the
remaining balance due on July 30, 2001. A Company  shareholder and the Company's
president  personally  secure  the  debt.  In  consideration  for  securing  the
Agreement,  the said  shareholder  and  president  received  150,000  and 25,000
warrants  respectively,  to purchase  the  Company's  common stock at $6.375 per
share, which was the market value of the Company's common stock on the date such
warrants were issued. Expense related to the warrants issued to the non-employee
shareholder will be recognized over the three-year term of the Agreement.

In  association  with  obtaining  the $3 million  line of credit  facility,  the
Company  terminated its previous $500,000 line of credit agreement (revised from
$1 million  line of credit  agreement  in June 1998) and repaid all  outstanding
term loans.

In addition,  the Company has warrants  outstanding  for the purchase of 367,500
shares of its  Common  Stock.  Assuming  the  exercise  of all such  outstanding
warrants, the Company would receive approximately $1,512,000 in gross proceeds.

On October 27, 1999, NYFIX announced the formation of NYFIX  Millennium,  with a
consortium  of seven leading  international  banks and  brokerage  firms.  NYFIX
Millennium  intends to  operate as an  alternative  trading  system.  All of the
members of the consortium,  including NYFIX, Inc. have invested  $2,000,000 each
in NYFIX Millennium.  In addition,  each of the seven non-NYFIX members received
187,500  shares of common  stock of NYFIX  totaling  1,312,500  shares of common
stock (adjusted for stock split).

Working Capital
At December 31, 1999 and 1998 the Company had working  capital of  approximately
$4,488,000 and $5,970,000, respectively. The Company's present capital resources
include  proceeds  from its 1999 and 1998 private  placement of Common Stock and
drawdowns from its bank credit facility.

Cash Used in Operating Activities
During fiscal 1999, net cash earned from operations was approximately $1,583,000
as  compared  to cash  used  in  operations  in  fiscal  1998  of  approximately
$1,159,000.   The  increase  from  fiscal  1998  to  fiscal  1999  is  primarily
attributable  to the  change  in  profitability  from a  loss  of  approximately
$2,234,000 in 1998 to net income of approximately $960,000.



                                       14
<PAGE>
Cash Used in Investing Activities
During fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998,  net cash used in investing  activities  was
approximately   $7,907,000  and   $3,152,000,   respectively,   and  principally
represents the Company's investment in NYFIX Millennium, along with payments for
the increased  purchases of equipment  related to the Company's  data center and
subscription equipment and payments related to product enhancement costs for the
Company's product portfolio.

Proceeds From Financing Activities
During fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998,  proceeds  from  financing  activities  were
approximately $3,942,000 and $6,117,000,  respectively.  Such increase in fiscal
1999  primarily  resulted from the issuance of Common Stock through the issuance
of common  stock for the  investment  of NYFIX  Millennium  and the  exercise of
warrants and stock options totaling approximately $874,000, and borrowings under
our credit line of approximately $700,000.


Year 2000 Compliance

NYFIX  completed a Year 2000 plan  consisting of several  phases which  include,
risk  assessment,  manual and automated  review of  programming  code,  baseline
testing, unit testing,  integrated testing and a review of third party products.
Our systems, both internal and external,  were fully functional during and after
the  calendar  year and leap year  transitions.  The  Company  will  continue to
monitor critical business systems for possible Year 2000 system issues.


Seasonality
The Company  believes  that its  operations  are not  significantly  effected by
seasonality.


New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities." This statement
establishes   standards  for  the   accounting   and  reporting  for  derivative
instruments  and for hedging  activities  and  requires the  recognition  of all
derivatives  as assets or  liabilities  measured at their fair  value.  Gains or
losses  resulting  from  changes  in the  fair  value  of  derivatives  would be
recognized in earnings in the period of change unless certain  hedging  criteria
are met.  We do not  expect  the  Statement  to have a  material  impact  on our
consolidated  financial statements.  The statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999.

ITEM 7a. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The  Company is exposed to market  risk  principally  with  changes in  interest
rates.  Interest  rate  exposure is  principally  limited to the $2.5 million of
long-term  debt  outstanding  at December 31, 1999,  under the Company's line of
credit agreement. Borrowings under the line of credit agreement bear interest at
rates that float with the market.  Assuming a change of 100 basis  points in the
interest rates on the line of credit agreement,  interest expense and cash flows
would be affected by approximately  $25,000 on an annual basis. The Company does
not use derivative financial instruments for any purpose.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Stockholders of NYFIX, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of NYFIX, Inc. (a
New York corporation) and subsidiary  (formerly  Trinitech Systems,  Inc.) as of
December  31,  1999  and  1998,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of
operations,  stockholders'  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the  period  ended  December  31,  1999.  These  financial  statements  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial position of NYFIX, Inc. and subsidiary as
of December  31, 1999 and 1998,  and the results of their  operations  and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 1999 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our  audits  were  made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
financial  statements taken as a whole. The schedule of valuation and qualifying
accounts  (note 16) is presented for purposes of complying  with the  Securities
and  Exchange  Commissions  rules  and  is  not  part  of  the  basic  financial
statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied
in the audit of the basic  financial  statements  and,  in our  opinion,  fairly
states in all material  respects  the  financial  data  required to be set forth
therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                        DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997






1.          ORGANIZATION AND PRESENTATION

            NYFIX,  Inc. and subsidiary  (formerly  known as Trinitech  Systems,
            Inc.,  the  "Company")  develops  and  markets  advanced  electronic
            trading systems to brokerage firms,  international  banks and global
            exchanges  trading in equities and futures & options.  The Company's
            NYFIX  Network,  a  combined  FIX  (Financial  Information  Exchange
            protocol)   and   Exchange   Access   Network,   enables   users  to
            electronically communicate trade data among the buy-side, sell-side,
            and exchange floor environments.  In addition,  the Company offers a
            range of related  information  technology  services and  maintenance
            support.  The Company is headquartered in Stamford,  Connecticut and
            maintains operations in New York, Chicago and London.


2.          SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

            Principles of Consolidation

            The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NYFIX,
            Inc. and its subsidiary.  All significant  intercompany balances and
            transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

            Use of Estimates

            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
            accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
            and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial
            statements and accompanying  notes. Actual results could differ from
            those estimates.

            Reclassifications

            Certain 1998 and 1997 balances have been  reclassified to conform to
            the 1999 presentation.

            Cash and Cash Equivalents

            The Company  considers all highly liquid  instruments  with original
            maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

            Inventories

            Inventories consist of parts, finished goods and minor materials and
            are  stated  at the lower of cost,  determined  on an  average  cost
            basis, or market.




                                       25

            Equipment

            Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Included
            in equipment are certain payroll costs related to the development of
            the  NYFIX  network  and other  long-lived  assets  to  support  the
            Company's subscription and service based businesses. Depreciation is
            provided using the  straight-line  method over the estimated  useful
            lives of the assets  ranging from two to eight years.  The estimated
            useful  lives  for  subscription  and  service  based  equipment  is
            generally  two to three years.  In the fourth  quarter of 1998,  the
            Company extended the life of certain subscription equipment from two
            to  three  years.  The  change  decreased  depreciation  expense  by
            approximately $20,000.

            Other Assets

            Other  assets  consist  principally  of  patents,  deferred  product
            enhancements   costs   (capitalized   based  on  time  incurred  for
            enhancements   of  products   which  have   achieved   technological
            feasibility),  and  deposits.  Product  enhancement  costs are being
            amortized using the  straight-line  method over three years.  Patent
            costs are being amortized over seventeen years.

            Long-Lived Assets

            Long-lived  assets,  primarily  equipment,   other  assets  and  the
            investment in NYFIX Millennium are reviewed for impairment  whenever
            events  or  circumstances  indicate  that the  asset's  undiscounted
            expected  cash  flows are not  sufficient  to recover  its  carrying
            amount.  The Company  measures an  impairment  loss by comparing the
            fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. The fair value of an
            asset is calculated  based upon the present value of expected future
            cash  flows.  There  has been no  impairment  in  long-lived  assets
            through December 31, 1999.

            Revenue Recognition

            Sales are  generally  recorded  upon  shipment of the product to and
            acceptance by customers.  Subscription revenue is recognized ratably
            over  the  life  of  the  subscription  agreements  with  customers.
            Installation revenue is recognized at time of installation.  Revenue
            from  service  contracts is  recognized  ratably over the period the
            services  are  performed.  Amounts  billed in advance  for  service,
            installation and  subscription  contracts are deferred and reflected
            as advance billings.


            Research and Development

            Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

            Advertising

            The Company  expenses  advertising  costs as  incurred.  Advertising
            expense was  approximately  $159,000,  $294,000 and $320,000 for the
            years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

            Foreign Currency Translation

            The Company's  functional currency is the U.S. dollar.  Accordingly,
            the monetary  assets and  liabilities of the London sales office are
            translated at year-end exchange rates while non-monetary  assets and
            liabilities  are  translated  at  historical  rates.   Revenues  and
            expenses are  translated at average rates in effect during the year,
            except for depreciation  and cost of sales,  which are translated at
            historical rates. The resulting currency translation gain or loss is
            included in the results of operations for the periods presented.

            Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share

            The Company  accounts  for  earnings  (loss) per common  share under
            Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  (SFAS)  No.  128,
            "Earnings per share."

            The weighted  average number of common shares  outstanding  used for
            calculating  earnings  (loss)  per share is based upon the number of
            shares  outstanding  at the end of  each  period.  Diluted  earnings
            (loss) per share are not  presented  in either 1998 or 1997  because
            the effect of the Company's common stock equivalents (employee stock
            options and warrants) is antidilutive.

            Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle

            In 1998,  the American  Institute of  Certified  Public  Accountants
            issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-5,  "Reporting on the Costs of
            Start-Up  Activities." The SOP requires costs of start-up activities
            and  organization  costs to be  expensed  as  incurred.  The Company
            adopted the SOP in 1999 and  recognized a charge for the  cumulative
            effect of accounting change of approximately $42,000.

            Income Taxes

            The  Company   accounts   for  income  taxes  under  SFAS  No.  109,
            "Accounting for Income Taxes."

            The Company  uses  different  methods of  accounting  for  financial
            reporting and tax purposes,  principally  through the utilization of
            accelerated  depreciation  methods for income tax purposes,  certain
            valuation allowances and net operating loss carry-forwards. Deferred
            taxes are provided on the basis of such differences.

            Financial Instruments

            The carrying  value for all current  assets and current  liabilities
            approximates  fair value  because of their  short-term  nature.  The
            carrying value of the Company's long-term debt also approximates its
            fair value based on prevailing interest rates.

            Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements


            In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued SFAS
            No.  133,   "Accounting  for  Derivative   Instruments  and  Hedging
            Activities." This statement establishes standards for the accounting
            and reporting for derivative  instruments and for hedging activities
            and  requires  the  recognition  of all  derivatives  as  assets  or
            liabilities  measured at their fair value. Gains or losses resulting
            from changes in the fair value of derivatives would be recognized in
            earnings in the period of change unless certain hedging criteria are
            met.  The Company  does not expect the  Statement to have a material
            impact  on the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  Financial
            Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No. 137, which deferred the
            effective  date for SFAS No.  133,  to all  fiscal  quarters  of all
            fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.

            as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Amounts deferred are
            based upon an analysis of payroll and other costs  directly  related
            to the enhancement of existing  products.  Included in cost of sales
            is   amortization   expense   for  product   enhancement   costs  of

5           EARNINGS PER SHARE

            The  Company's  basic  EPS  is  calculated  based  on  net  earnings
            available to common shareholders and the weighted-average  number of
            shares outstanding during the reported period.  Diluted EPS includes
            additional  dilution  from common stock  equivalents,  such as stock
            issuable  pursuant  to the  exercise  of  stock  options  and  stock
            warrants.

            Stock options and warrants  were  excluded from the earnings  (loss)

            anti-dilutive.

6.          CAPITAL STOCK

            On October  21,  1999,  shareholders  approved  an  increase  in the
            authorized  shares of the  Company's  common  and  preferred  stock.
            Common shares were  increased  from 15 million to 60 million  shares
            and preferred shares from 1 million to 5 million shares.  Along with
            this  increase,  the Board of  Directors  authorized a 3 for 2 stock
            split in the form of a 50% stock  dividend  to all  shareholders  of
            record on November 1, 1999, and was paid on November 15, 1999.

            On September 7, 1999, the Company  completed a private  placement of
            187,500  shares of Common  Stock  (adjusted  for stock  split) to an
            institutional  investment  firm  at a  price  equal  to the  average
            closing  price  of the  stock  for the  30-day  period  prior to the
            closing date on September 1, 1999. This approximated the fair market
            value of the stock at $13.583 per share  (adjusted  for stock split)
            for an aggregate value of $2,546,875.

            On November 24, 1998, the Company  completed a private  placement of
            900,000  shares of Common  Stock,  (adjusted  for stock  split) at a
            price of $4.00 per  share,  for an  aggregate  value of  $3,600,000.
            Costs related to this offering  amounted to  approximately  $150,000
            resulting   in  net   proceeds  to  the  Company  of   approximately
            $3,450,000.

            On March 7, 1997,  the  Company  completed  a private  placement  of
            1,200,000  shares of Common  Stock,  (adjusted for stock split) at a
            price of $3.00 per  share,  for an  aggregate  value of  $3,600,000.
            Costs related to this  offering  amounted to  approximately  $85,000
            resulting   in  net   proceeds  to  the  Company  of   approximately
            $3,515,000.

            On  September 1, 1997,  the Board of  Directors  declared a dividend
            distribution of one Preference  Share Purchase right (a "Right") for
            each  outstanding  share of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share,
            of the Company to stockholders of record on September 19, 1997. Each
            Right  entitles the  registered  holder to purchase from the Company
            one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preference Stock, par value
            $.001  per  share,  of  the  Company,  at a  price  of $40  per  one
            one-hundredth  of a Preference  Share,  subject to adjustment,  upon
            change  of  control  in  the  Company,  as  defined  in  the  rights
            agreement.

            Due to the nature of the Preference Shares' dividend liquidation and
            voting rights,  the value of a Preference  Share should  approximate
            the value of one share of Common Stock.

                                       29

            During 1999, approximately 121,000 warrants and 169,000 options were
            exercised for approximately 290,000 shares of Common Stock (adjusted
            for stock split). The Company received  approximately  $186,000 from
            the warrant  exercises  and  approximately  $532,000 from the option
            exercises.


7.          MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND EXPORT SALES

            For the year ended December 31, 1999 two customers accounted for 24%
            of total sales.  For the year ended December 31, 1998, two customers
            accounted for  approximately  26% of total sales. For the year ended
            December 31, 1997, one customer  accounted for  approximately 17% of
            total  sales.  Export  sales  amounted  to  approximately  $733,000,
            $234,000 and $1,283,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999,  1998
            and 1997, respectively.


8.          RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES

            Research and  development  expenses for the years ended December 31,
            1999,  1998 and 1997 totaled  approximately  $297,000,  $537,000 and
            $322,000,  respectively  and are  included in  selling,  general and
            administrative expenses.


9.          DEBT

            On July 13, 1998,  the Company  entered into a three-year $3 million
            line  of  credit  agreement  (the   "Agreement")  with  a  financial
            institution with advances on such agreement available to the Company
            during  the  first  eighteen  months.  The  Agreement  is  primarily
            intended to finance existing and future equipment expenditures.  The
            Agreement  bears  interest at either  LIBOR plus 1.25% or the Bank's
            Prime rate. The rate used is at management's discretion. The Company
            drew down an aggregate of $1,800,000 under the Agreement during 1998
            and  an  additional  $700,000  during  1999.  The  weighted  average
            outstanding borrowings during 1999 were approximately  $2,059,000 at
            a weighted average  interest rate of 7.43%.  The Agreement  requires
            monthly payments of interest only until January 30, 2000.  Principal
            drawdowns  under  the  Agreement  cannot  be  prepaid  in the  first
            eighteen months.  Repayment of principal commences on July 30, 2000,
            with  twelve  monthly  installments  of $83,333  with the  remaining
            balance due on July 30, 2001.  The debt is  personally  secured by a
            Company  non-employee  shareholder and the Company's  president.  In
            consideration  for securing the Agreement,  the said shareholder and
            president   received   225,000  and  37,500  warrants   respectively
            (adjusted for stock split),  to purchase the Company's  common stock
            at $4.25 per  share,  which was the  market  value of the  Company's
            common  stock on the date such  warrants  were  issued.  The expense
            related to the warrants issued to the non-employee  shareholder will
            be recognized over the three-year term of the Agreement.

            The following is a schedule of principal payments as of December 31,
            1999:

                         2000                                 $   500,000
                         2001                                   2,000,000


            In  association  with  obtaining  the  $3  million  line  of  credit
            facility,  the Company  terminated  its  previous  $500,000  line of
            credit agreement and repaid all outstanding term loans. The weighted
            average outstanding borrowings under the previous credit line during
            1998  approximated  $74,000 at a weighted  average  interest rate of
            9.50%.

10.         COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

            At December  31, 1999,  the Company was  committed  under  operating
            leases for offices,  production  facilities  and equipment for terms
            expiring through June 6, 2009. Future minimum annual rental payments
            are as follows:


Year                                                          Amount
- ----                                                          ------
2000                                                        $772,144
2001                                                         483,916
2002                                                         365,088
2003                                                         280,266
2004                                                         293,883
Thereafter                                                   693,496

            Aggregate  rental  expense   amounted  to  approximately   $780,000,
            $623,000 and $229,000  for the years ended  December 31, 1999,  1998
            and 1997, respectively.

            In 1991, the Company  entered into an employment  agreement with its
            President. The agreement calls for a base salary of $114,000 for the
            first year,  with such base salary to be reviewed on an annual basis
            thereafter by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

            The Company may be subject to legal proceedings,  which arise in the
            ordinary  course of  business.  In the  opinion of  management,  the
            ultimate  resolution of these matters will not materially affect the
            Company's financial statements.

11.         RELATED PARTIES

            Certain executive officers and directors of the Company have amounts
            due to the Company for the exercise of warrants  for capital  stock.
            Such  amounts  aggregated  $631,624  and $452,925 as of December 31,
            1999 and 1998,  respectively,  and have been shown as a reduction to
            stockholders' equity.

            At December  31, 1999 and 1998,  the Company had amounts  receivable
            from officers of $156,992 and $120,583, respectively.


12.         DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

            The Company sponsors a 401(k)  retirement plan (the "Plan") covering
            substantially  all  of  its  U.S.  employees  who  meet  eligibility
            requirements.  The Plan permits  participants  to contribute up to a
            maximum of 15% of their  annual  compensation,  as  defined,  not to
            exceed the federal  limit of $10,000 in 1999.  The Plan  permits the
            Company  to match  employees'  tax  deferred  contributions  up to a
            maximum  of 3%  of  employees'  compensation  provided  the  Company
            employs the employee at the end of the year. Remaining contributions
            under the Plan are discretionary.  Total contribution under the Plan
            approximated  $80,000,  $57,000 and $52,000 in 1999,  1998 and 1997,
            respectively.

The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes   option-pricing   model  with  the   following   weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1999, 1998 and 1997:

     o Risk free interest rates range from 4.18% to 6.42%
     o Expected  dividend yields of 0%
     o Expected lives of 3 to 5 years and
     o Expected volatility of 65%, 63% and 66%, respectively

The  Company  applies  APB  Opinion  No.  25  "Accounting  for  Stock  Issued to
Employees" to account for its stock plans.  Except for certain  warrants granted
to non-employees  during 1998, no compensation  cost has been recognized for any
option grants in the accompanying income statement.  Had compensation costs been
recorded,  the net  earnings  (loss) and basic and diluted  earnings  (loss) per
share would have been  reduced  from the  following  as reported  amounts to the
following pro forma amounts:

14.         BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION


            The Company has two principal business groups:  Equities and Futures
            & Options. The Equities Group operates primarily out of Stamford/New
            York offices,  while the Futures & Options Group operates  primarily
            out of the London and Chicago offices.  However, each office has the
            opportunity to sell all of the Company's products. The Company views
            each office as its own business  segment,  measures its  performance
            based on the revenues of each location.  The Company makes decisions
            on each segment based on gross profit.

            Foreign  operation  revenues  amounted to approximately  $2,636,000,
            $2,001,000  and  $1,293,000  for the years ended  December 31, 1999,
            1998 and 1997, respectively. Intersegment sales are accounted for at
            cost.

            Identifiable assets by segment include assets directly  identifiable
            with those  operations.  Other assets consist primarily of corporate
            cash  and  cash   equivalents  and  fixed  assets   associated  with
            non-segment activities.

            Summarized financial  information by business segment for 1999, 1998
            and 1997 is as follows (in 000's):

<PAGE>

            $4,300,000 and $5,270,000, respectively. These losses expire between
            2014 and 2019. The tax benefit of such operating loss carry-forwards
            will be credited  to income  when  realization  is  considered  more
            likely than not. In  addition,  these  amounts may be limited  under
            Internal  Revenue Code Section 382 as a result of ownership  changes
            resulting from the Company's equity offerings.

            Significant  components of the provision  (benefit) for income taxes

17.         JOINT VENTURE

            On October 27, 1999,  the Company  announced  the formation of NYFIX
            Millennium,  L.L.C.  ("NYFIX Millennium") with a consortium of seven
            leading  international  investment banks and brokerage firms.  NYFIX
            owns 50% of the joint venture and the seven other  investors own the
            remaining 50%. NYFIX Millennium intends to operate as an alternative
            trading system for  institutional  investors.  All of the members of
            the consortium, including the Company, have invested $2,000,000 each
            in NYFIX Millennium. In return for their investment, each non-NYFIX,
            Inc.  partner received 187,500 shares of common stock of the Company
            for an  aggregate  1,312,500  shares  (adjusted  for  stock  split).
            NYFIX's  total  investment  in  the


                                       37
<PAGE>

            joint venture of $19,500,000 consists of (1,312,500 shares x $13.33)
            $17,500,000  plus  the  capital  cash  contribution  of  $2,000,000.
            Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the first $14,000,000 in losses
            will be  allocated to the seven  non-NYFIX,  Inc.  investors,  which
            equals the extent of their capital  investment in NYFIX  Millennium.
            The  Company  retains the option to buy back the units up to no more
            than 80% of the total membership interest.  The Company may exercise
            the option through the exchange of one share of the Company's common
            stock for each unit to be purchased,  subject to  adjustments in the
            event  of  any  split,   combination,   reclassification   or  other
            adjustments to the capital structure of the Company. The Company has
            incurred  operating and capital costs on behalf of NYFIX Millennium.
            Such costs are reflected as due from NYFIX  Millennium Joint Venture
            on the Company's balance sheet.


18.         SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

            On March 14,  2000,  the Company  announced a 3 for 2 stock split in
            the form of a 50% stock  dividend to all  shareholders  of record on
            March 24, 2000, payable on April 4, 2000. The Company has 16,021,762
            common  shares   outstanding  prior  to  the  split  and  will  have
            24,032,643 shares outstanding following the split.

            On March 16, 2000, Trinitech Systems  International,  Inc., a wholly
            owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company  announced  a  straight  through
            processing  joint  venture  with  Rolfe and Nolan  PLC,  to  provide
            advanced  web-based client order management  systems and back office
            interfaces for the global market.

execution  and delivery of this  Agreement,  make the Capital  Contribution  set
forth on his respective  signature page hereto,  in  consideration of which each
Member  shall  receive  the  Membership  Interest  set  forth on its  respective

apply:

                    (a) To each Member's Capital Account there shall be credited
         (i) the  amount of money  contributed  by such  Member  to the  Company
         (including  liabilities  of the  Company  assumed  by  such  Member  as
         provided in Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(c) of the Tax Regulations);  (ii)
         the fair market  value of any  Property  contributed  to the Company by

         provided in Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(c) of the Tax Regulations) other
         than amounts which are in repayment of debt  obligations of the Company
         to such Member;  (ii) the fair market value of Property  distributed to
         such Member (net of liabilities  secured by such  distributed  Property
         that such  Member is  considered  to  assume or take  subject  to under
         Section 752 of the Code);  and (iii) such  Member's  share of Losses or
         items of loss or deduction that are specially allocated.

The foregoing  provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to
the  maintenance  of  Capital  Accounts  are  intended  to comply  with  Section
1.704-1(b) of the Tax  Regulations  and Section  704(c) of the Code and shall be
interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Tax Regulations. In the
event the  Members  shall  determine  that it is prudent to modify the manner in
which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto (including, without
limitation,  debits or  credits  relating  to  liabilities  that are  secured by
contributed  or  distributed  Property or that are assumed by the Company or any
Member), are computed in order to comply with such Tax Regulations,  the Members
may make such modification, provided that it is not likely to have a


                                       -8-

<PAGE>

material effect on the amounts  distributable  to any Member pursuant to Article

Commitment.

of  Directors  may,  in its sole  discretion,  from  time to time,  admit to the
Company one or more persons as additional  Initial Members;  provided,  however,
that the  number of Initial  Members,  other  than  Trinitech,  shall not exceed
seven.  Each  additional  Initial  Member shall  execute a  counterpart  of this
Agreement  and such other  instruments  as the Board of Directors may require to
confirm  the  undertaking  of such  person  to be  bound  by all the  terms  and
provisions of this  Agreement.  At any time  subsequent to October 31, 1999, the
Company  may from  time to time,  with the  prior  written  consent  of both (i)
two-thirds of the Members,  such two-thirds calculated on the basis of the total
number  of  Members  without  regard  to  the  Members'  respective   Membership
Interests,  and (ii)  Trinitech,  admit to the  Company  one or more  persons as
additional  Members.  Each such additional Member shall execute a counterpart of
this Agreement and such other  instruments as the Board of Directors may require
to  confirm  the  undertaking  of such  person  to be bound by all the terms and
provisions  of this  Agreement.  With  respect  to any  such  additional  Member
admitted to the Company on or after  October 31, 1999,  the Capital  Accounts of
Members other than such additional Member shall be adjusted, i.e. "booked up" or
"booked   down"   as   the   case   may   be,   in   accordance   with   Section

additional Member,  except as otherwise determined by consent of the Members and
Trinitech as provided above.

                          ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

         8.1 Profits and  Losses.  Profits and Losses,  and each item of Company
income, gain, loss,  deduction,  credit and tax preference with respect thereto,
for each Fiscal Period (or shorter  period in respect of which such items are to
be allocated)  shall be allocated  among the Members as provided in this Article
VIII.

                    (a) Profits.  After giving effect to the special allocations
set forth in Sections  8.3, 8.4 and 8.6,  Profits for any Fiscal Period shall be
allocated:  80% to Trinitech and 20% to the Non- Trinitech Members in accordance
with Section 8.5.




                                       -9-

<PAGE>

                    (b) Losses.  After giving effect to the special  allocations
set forth in Sections 8.4 and 8.5,  Losses  shall be allocated in the  following
order of priority:

                           (i) first,  as to the first  Losses up to the product
                    of (x)  $2,000,000  multiplied  by (y) the number of Initial
                    Members  (other  than  Trinitech),  to  the  Non-  Trinitech
                    Members,  in  proportion  to  their  respective   Membership
                    Interests,  but  only  to the  extent  of  their  respective
                    Capital Account balances;

                           (ii)  second,  to  Trinitech  to  the  extent  of its
                    Capital Account balance; and

                           (iii) then, the balance, if any, among the Members in
                    proportion to their respective Membership Interests.

         8.2        Distributions.

                    (a)  Dividends.  Distributions  shall  be  made  (i)  to the
Non-Trinitech  Members in an amount  equal to 20% of the  Profits for any Fiscal
Period,  which  distribution  shall be the Special  Dividend  allocated and paid
pursuant  to the  provisions  set  forth in  Section  8.2(b)  below  and (ii) to
Trinitech  in an amount equal to 80% of the Profits for any Fiscal  Period.  The
distributions  to Trinitech  shall be made at such time or times as the Board of
Directors shall determine consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.

                    (b)  Non-Trinitech   Member  Dividends.   Dividends  to  the
Non-Trinitech  Members as  provided in Section  8.2(a)  above shall be paid as a
Special  Dividend no later than 45 days  following the end of any fiscal quarter
in which the Company shows a Profit.  Such Special Dividend shall be distributed
amongst the Non-Trinitech  Members  according to the fraction,  the numerator of
which is the aggregate order flow volume measured in Company  eligible shares of
each Non- Trinitech  Member during such fiscal  quarter,  and the denominator of
which is aggregate order flow volume measure in Company  eligible shares for all
Non-Trinitech  Members during such fiscal quarter.  For example,  if the Profits
for a fiscal quarter are $25 million, and a Non-Trinitech Member puts through 50
million  aggregate order flow volume measured in Company  eligible shares during
such fiscal  quarter,  while all  Non-Trinitech  Members put through 100 million
aggregate  order flow volume  measured in Company  eligible  shares  during such
fiscal quarter, then such Member shall receive one-half of the available Special
Dividend,  or $2.5 million.  No such Special Dividend shall be payable following
any fiscal  quarter in which the Company has not shown a Profit,  nor shall such
Special Dividend be payable to the Non-Trinitech  Member(s), if any, who fail to
effectuate  any trades  with the Company  during the fiscal  quarter for which a
Special Dividend relates.

         8.3 Special  Allocations.  The following  special  allocations shall be
made in the following order:

                    (a) Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 1.704- 2(f) of the Tax Regulations,  notwithstanding any other provision
of this Article  VIII,  if there is a net decrease in  Partnership  Minimum Gain
during any Fiscal Period, each Member shall be specially

                                      -10-

<PAGE>
allocated  items of Company  income and gain for such  Fiscal  Period  (and,  if
necessary,  subsequent Fiscal Periods) in an amount equal to such Member's share
of the net decrease in Partnership  Minimum Gain,  determined in accordance with
Section 1.704-2(g) of the Tax Regulations.  Allocations pursuant to the previous
sentence  shall be made in proportion to the respective  amounts  required to be
allocated to each Member pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be
determined in accordance with Sections  1.704-2(f)(6)  and  1.704-2(j)(2) of the
Tax Regulations. This Section 8.3(a) is intended to comply with the minimum gain
chargeback requirement in Section 1.704-2(f) of the Tax Regulations and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith.

                    (b) Partner  Minimum  Gain  Chargeback.  Except as otherwise
provided in Section  1.704-2(i)(4) of the Tax Regulations,  notwithstanding  any
other  provision  of this  Article  VIII,  if there is a net decrease in Partner
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain attributable to a Partner  Nonrecourse Debt during
any Fiscal Period,  each Member who has a share of the Partner  Nonrecourse Debt
Minimum  Gain  attributable  to such Partner  Nonrecourse  Debt,  determined  in
accordance with Section 1.704-2(i)(5) of the Tax Regulations, shall be specially
allocated  items of Company  income and gain for such  Fiscal  Period  (and,  if
necessary,  subsequent Fiscal Periods) in an amount equal to such Member's share
of the net decrease in Partner  Nonrecourse  Debt Minimum Gain  attributable  to
such Partner  Nonrecourse  Debt,  determined in accordance  with Section  1.704-
2(i)(4) of the Tax Regulations.  Allocations  pursuant to the previous  sentence
shall be made in proportion to the respective  amounts  required to be allocated
to  each  Member  pursuant  thereto.  The  items  to be so  allocated  shall  be
determined in accordance with Sections  1.704-2(i)(4)  and 1.704- 2(j)(2) of the
Tax Regulations. This Section 8.3(b) is intended to comply with the minimum gain
chargeback requirement in Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Tax Regulations and shall
be interpreted consistently therewith.

                    (c)  Qualified  Income  Offset.  In  the  event  any  Member
unexpectedly receives any adjustments,  allocations,  or distributions described
in Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6) of the Tax Regulations, items of Company income and gain
shall be specially allocated to the Member in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate,  to the extent required by the Tax Regulations,  the Adjusted Capital
Account  Deficit  of the  Member  as  quickly  as  possible,  provided  that  an
allocation  pursuant  to this  Section  8.3(c)  shall be made only if and to the
extent that the Member would have an Adjusted  Capital Account Deficit after all
other  allocations  provided for in this Article VIII have been tentatively made
as if this Section 8.3(c) were not in this Agreement.

                    (d) Gross Income  Allocation.  In the event any Member has a
deficit  Capital  Account at the end of any Fiscal  Period which is in excess of
the sum of the amounts such Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant
to the penultimate sentences of Sections  1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5) of the
Tax Regulations,  each such Member shall be specially allocated items of Company
income and gain in the amount of such  excess as quickly as  possible,  provided
that an allocation  pursuant to this Section 8.3(d) shall be made only if and to
the extent that such Member  would have a deficit  Capital  Account in excess of
such sum after all other allocations provided for in this Article VIII have been
made as if Section 8.3(c) and this Section 8.3(d) were not in this Agreement.


                                      -11-

<PAGE>

                    (e) Nonrecourse  Deductions.  Nonrecourse Deductions for any
Fiscal  Period shall be specially  allocated  among the Members in proportion to
their Membership Interests.

                    (f) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions.  Any Partner Nonrecourse
Deductions for any Fiscal Period shall be specially  allocated to the Member who
bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the Partner  Nonrecourse Debt to
which such Partner  Nonrecourse  Deductions are  attributable in accordance with
Section 1.704-2(i)(1) of the Tax Regulations.

                    (g) Mandatory  Allocations Under Section 704(c) of the Code.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions  of this  Section  8.3, in the event
Section 704(c) of the Code or Section 704(c) of the Code  principles  applicable
under Section  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)  of the Tax Regulations  require allocations of
Profits  or  Losses  in a manner  different  than  that  set  forth  above,  the
provisions  of  Section  704(c) of the Code and the Tax  Regulations  thereunder
shall control such  allocations  among the Members.  Any item of Company income,
gain, loss and deduction with respect to any property (other than cash) that has
been  contributed  by a Member to the  capital of the  Company or which has been
revalued for Capital Account purposes pursuant to Section  1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)  of
the Tax  Regulations) and which is required or permitted to be allocated to such
Member for income tax purposes  under  Section  704(c) of the Code so as to take
into account the  variation  between the tax basis of such property and its fair
market  value at the time of its  contribution  shall be  allocated  solely  for
income tax purposes in the manner so required or permitted  under Section 704(c)
of the Code using the "traditional  method"  described in Section  1.704-3(b) of
the Tax Regulations;  provided, however, that curative allocations consisting of
the special allocation of gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of the
contributed  property shall be made in accordance with Section 1.704-3(c) of the
Tax  Regulations  to the extent  necessary to eliminate  any  disparity,  to the
extent possible, between the Members' book and tax Capital Accounts attributable
to such property;  further  provided,  however,  that any other method allowable
under applicable Tax Regulations may be used for any contribution of property as
to which  there is  agreement  between  the  contributing  Member  and the other
Members.

         8.4 Curative Allocations. The allocations set forth in Sections 8.3 (a)
through (g) (the "Regulatory  Allocations")  are intended to comply with certain
requirements  of the Tax  Regulations.  It is the intent of the Members that, to
the extent  possible,  all  Regulatory  Allocations  shall be offset either with
other  Regulatory  Allocations  or with  special  allocations  of other items of
Company  income,  gain,  loss,  or  deduction  pursuant  to  this  Section  8.4.
Therefore,  notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VIII (other than
the  Regulatory  Allocations),  the Members shall make such  offsetting  special
allocations of Company  income,  gain,  loss, or deduction in whatever manner it
determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each
Member's  Capital  Account  balance  is, to the  extent  possible,  equal to the
Capital Account balance such Member would have had if the Regulatory Allocations
were not part of this Agreement and all Company items were allocated pursuant to
Sections 8.2 and 8.3. The Members (i) shall take into account future  Regulatory
Allocations  under Sections  8.3(a) and 8.3(b) that,  although not yet made, are
likely to offset other  Regulatory  Allocations  previously  made under Sections
8.3(e)  and  8.3(f) and (ii) may  reallocate  Profits  and Losses for prior open
years (or items of gross  income and  deduction  of the  Company for such years)
among the Members to the extent it is not possible to achieve such result


                                      -12-

<PAGE>

with  allocations of items of income  (including gross income) and deduction for
the  current   year  and  future   years.   This   Section  8.4  shall   control
notwithstanding any reallocation or adjustment of taxable income,  taxable loss,
or items thereof by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

         8.5        Allocations Relating to Non-Trinitech Member Dividends.

                    (a) Any  Non-Trinitech  Member  allocated a Special Dividend
pursuant to Section 8.2 shall also be allocated  that  percentage of the Profits
for the fiscal  quarter that  relates to such Non-  Trinitech  Member's  Special
Dividend.

                    (b) The  amount of any  Special  Dividend  shall be  charged
against and shall reduce the Capital  Accounts of the  Non-Trinitech  Members in
accordance with the distributions to each such Non-Trinitech  Member pursuant to
Section 8.2(b).

         8.6        Other Allocation Rules.

                    (a) For purposes of determining the Profits,  Losses, or any
other item allocable to any period  (including  allocations to take into account
any changes in any Member's  Membership  Interest during a Fiscal Period and any
transfer of any interest in the Company),  Profits,  Losses,  and any such other
item shall be determined on a daily,  monthly,  or other basis, as determined by
the Members using any  permissible  method under Section 706 of the Code and the

                                      TAXES

         9.1 Tax Matters Partner.  Trinitech shall be the Tax Matters Partner of
the Company  pursuant to Section  6231(a)(7) of the Code.  Such Member shall not

and such  Member has given its  consent in  writing  to its  appointment  as Tax
Matters   Partner.   The  Tax  Matters   Partner  shall  receive  no  additional
compensation  from  the  Company  for its  services  in that  capacity,  but all
expenses  incurred by the Tax Matters Partner in such capacity shall be borne by
the Company.  The Tax Matters Partner is authorized to employ such  accountants,
attorneys and agents as he, in his sole  discretion,  determines is necessary to

in a similar  capacity with respect to any similar tax related or other election
provided by state or local laws.

         9.2 Section 754 Election.  The Board of Directors may agree to have the
Company make the  election  permitted by Section 754 of the Code with respect to

                                    ARTICLE X
                         TRANSFER OF MEMBERSHIP INTEREST

         10.1 Compliance with  Securities  Laws. No Unit of Membership  Interest
has  been  registered  under  the  Securities  Act  of  1933,  as  amended  (the
"Securities  Act"), or under any applicable  state securities laws. A Member may
not transfer (a transfer,  for  purposes of this  Agreement,  shall be deemed to
include, but not be limited to, any sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, creation
of a security  interest or other  disposition)  all or any part of such Member's
Units of Membership Interest, except upon compliance with the applicable federal
and state  securities laws. The Members shall have no obligation to register any
Member's  Units of Membership  Interest  under the  Securities  Act or under any
applicable state securities laws, or to make any exemption  therefrom  available
to any Member.

         10.2 Transfer of Economic Interest. The right to receive allocations of
Profits and Losses and to receive distributions may not be transferred, in whole
or in part, unless the following terms and conditions have been satisfied:

                    (a) Members  (including the transferring  Member) holding at
         least 51% of the Membership  Interests  shall have consented in writing
         to the transfer,  which consent may be arbitrarily withheld by any such
         Member;

                    (b) The transferor  shall have assumed all costs incurred by
         the Company in connection with the transfer;

                    (c) The  transferor  shall have furnished the Company with a
         written  opinion of  counsel,  satisfactory  in form and  substance  to
         counsel for the Company,  that such transfer  complies with  applicable
         federal  and  state  securities  laws and the  Agreement  and that such
         transfer,  for  federal  income  tax  purposes,   will  not  cause  the
         termination of the Company under Section 708(b) of the Code,  cause the
         Company to be treated as an  association  taxable as a corporation  for
         income tax  purposes or otherwise  adversely  affect the Company or the
         Members; and


                    (d) The  transferor  shall  have  complied  with such  other
         conditions as the Board may reasonably require from time to time.

Transfers  will be recognized by the Company as effective only upon the close of
business on the last day of the calendar  month  following  satisfaction  of the
above  conditions.  Any  transfer  in

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

contravention  of this  Article X and any  transfer  which if made would cause a
termination  of the Company for federal income tax purposes under Section 708(b)
of the Code shall be void ab initio and  without  force and effect and shall not
bind the Company or the other Members.  Transfers by Members to Affiliates shall
not be subject to the provisions of Section 10.2(a) hereof.

         10.3  Transfer of  Membership  Interest  and  Admission  of  Substitute
Member. Except for the right to receive allocations of Profits and Losses and to
receive  distributions,   a  Membership  Interest  of  any  Member  may  not  be
transferred,  in whole or in part,  and a  transferee  shall not have a right to
become a Member  unless,  in addition to satisfying  the terms and conditions of
Sections 10.2 (b), (c) and (d), the  following  terms and  conditions  have been
satisfied:

                    (a) Members  (including the transferring  Member) holding at
         least 51% of the Membership  Interests  shall have consented in writing
         to the  transfer and  substitution,  which  consent may be  arbitrarily
         withheld by any such Member;

                    (b) The transferee  shall have assumed the  obligations,  if
         any, of the  transferor  to the Company,  including  the  obligation to
         fulfill  the pro rata  portion of the  transferor's  then  existing  or
         subsequently  arising  Commitment  allocable to the transferred Unit of
         Membership Interest or portion thereof; and

                    (c) The transferor  and the  transferee  shall have complied
         with  such  other  requirements  as the  Board  may  reasonably  impose
         including, without limitation, the conditions that the transferee:

                           (i) adopt and  approve in  writing  all the terms and
                    provisions of the Agreement then in effect; and

                           (ii) pay such  fees as may be  reasonable  to pay the
                    costs of the Company in effecting such substitution.

                    Transfers by Members to  Affiliates  shall not be subject to
the provisions of Section 10.3(a) hereof.

         10.4 Status of  Transferee.  Except as  otherwise  provided  herein,  a
transferee of a Unit of Membership Interest who is not a Substitute Member shall
be entitled only to receive that share of Profits, Losses and distributions, and
the return of Capital Contributions,  to which the transferor would otherwise be
entitled with respect to the interest transferred, and shall not have the rights
of a Member of the Company under the Act or this  Agreement  including,  without
limitation,  the right to obtain any  information  on  account of the  Company's
transactions,  to inspect the Company's books or to vote with the Members on, or
to grant or withhold  consents or approvals of, any matter.  The Company  shall,
however, if a transferee and transferor jointly advise the Company in writing of
a transfer  of the Unit of  Membership  Interest,  furnish the  transferee  with
pertinent tax information at the end of each Fiscal Period.

         10.5 Transfer of Membership Interest of a BHCA Special Member and other
BHCA Related Provisions.

                    (a) A BHCA Special  Member's  Membership  Interest  shall be
held  by any  assignee  or  other  transferee  of  such  BHCA  Special  Member's
Membership  Interest in the same  capacity,  provided  that any such assignee or
transferee  shall  have  full  voting  rights  with  regard  to such  Membership
Interest,  without  regard to the  limitation set forth in Section 13.1, if they
are transferred (i) to the public in an offering registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities  Act"), (ii) in a transaction  pursuant
to Rules 144 or 144A under the Securities  Act in which no person  acquires more
than 2% of the Company's  outstanding  Membership Interests or (iii) in a single
transaction  to  a  third  party  who  acquires  a  majority  of  the  Company's
outstanding  Membership  Interests  without  regard to the transfer of such BHCA
Special  Member's  Membership  Interests.  In the  event of a change  in the law
governing a BHCA  Special  Member the effect of which is to permit any such BHCA
Special Member to transfer such  Membership  Interests in any other manner,  the
foregoing  shall be deemed  modified  to permit a  transfer  of such  Membership
Interests in such other manner.

                    (b) No transfer of a Unit of  Membership  Interest by a BHCA
Special  Member shall confer on such  transferee a greater  Membership  Interest
than such BHCA Special Member had after giving effect to the limitations imposed
pursuant to the BHCA unless such transferor  certifies to the Board of Directors
that the  transfer,  taking into  account the  increase in  Membership  Interest
resulting  therefrom,  is consistent with applicable  banking law, including the
BHCA.

                    (c) If at any time the percentage  Membership Interest owned
by a BHCA  Member or its  Affiliates  exceeds  24.99% of the  total  issued  and
outstanding  Membership  Interests of the Company (the  "Ownership  Threshold"),
such BHCA Member,  or its  Affiliate,  as the case may be, shall be permitted to
transfer that portion of its  Membership  Interest as is necessary to reduce its
percentage  ownership to the Ownership  Threshold,  notwithstanding any contrary
provision  limiting  transfer herein or in any agreement among the Members,  and
the Company shall cooperate to the extent reasonably  request by the BHCA Member
at the BHCA Member's expense in the discovery of a purchaser for such portion of
such BHCA Member's Membership  Interests;  provided,  however, that if such BHCA
Member,  or its  Affiliate,  as the case may be,  is  unable  within  60 days to
transfer such portion of its  Membership  Interests,  the Company will take such
action as such BHCA Member may  reasonably  request to reduce such BHCA Member's
percentage ownership to the Ownership Threshold, at the BHCA Member's expense.

         10.6 Legend on Certificates.  The  certificates  representing the Units
shall bear the following legend:

                    "THE  UNITS  OF  MEMBERSHIP  INTEREST  REPRESENTED  BY  THIS
                    CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO AN OPERATING AGREEMENT, A COPY OF
                    WHICH  IS ON  FILE  AT  THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  OFFICE  OF  THE
                    COMPANY.  THE UNITS OF MEMBERSHIP  INTEREST MAY NOT BE SOLD,
                    TRANSFERRED,  ASSIGNED, PLEDGED,

                    HYPOTHECATED,  OR OTHERWISE  DISPOSED OF EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
                    PROVIDED BY THE TERMS OF THE OPERATING AGREEMENT."

         10.7  Dispositions  Not in  Compliance  with  this  Article  Void.  Any
attempted disposition of a Unit of Membership Interest, or any part thereof, not
in compliance  with this Article X shall be void ab initio and without force and
effect and shall not bind the Company or the other Members.


                                   ARTICLE XI
                           DISSOLUTION AND WINDING UP

         11.1 Dissolution.  The Company shall be dissolved and its affairs wound
up, upon the first to occur of any of the following  events (each of which shall
constitute a Dissolution Event):

                    (a) the expiration of the term of the Agreement,  unless the
         Company is  continued  with the  consent of Members  holding at least a
         majority of the Membership Interests; or

                    (b) the  unanimous  written  consent of all of the  Members,
         without regard to whether or not a Member is a BHCA Member.

         11.2 Effect of Dissolution.  Upon dissolution, the Company shall not be
terminated and shall continue until the winding up of the affairs of the Company
is completed and a certificate of cancellation has been filed with the Office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

         11.3 Distribution of Assets on Dissolution.  Upon the winding up of the
Company,  the Members  acting  together  (or such  Person(s)  designated  by the
Members representing at least a majority of the Membership Interests) shall take
full account of the assets and  liabilities of the Company,  shall liquidate the
assets (unless the Members determine that a distribution of any Company Property
in-kind  would be more  advantageous  to the Members  than the sale  thereof) as
promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value thereof, and shall apply
and distribute the proceeds therefrom in the following order:

                    (a) first,  to the payment of the debts and  liabilities  of
         the Company to creditors,  including Members who are creditors,  to the
         extent permitted by law, in satisfaction of such debts and liabilities,
         and to the payment of necessary expenses of liquidation;

                    (b)  second,  to the  setting up of any  reserves  which the
         Members  may  deem  necessary  or  appropriate   for  any   anticipated
         obligations  or  contingencies  of  the  Company  arising  out of or in
         connection with the operation or business of the Company. Such reserves
         may be paid over by the Members to an escrow agent or trustee  selected
         by the  Members  to be  disbursed  by such  escrow  agent or trustee in
         payment of any of the aforementioned  obligations or contingencies and,
         if any balance  remains at the expiration of such period as


                                      -17-

<PAGE>

         the Members shall deem  advisable,  shall be distributed by such escrow
         agent or trustee in the manner hereinafter provided;

                    (c) third, to the Members pro rata in accordance with and to
         the extent of their positive Capital Account balances, if any;

                    (d) then, to the Members in accordance with their Membership
         Interests.

         Liquidation  proceeds  shall be paid  within  60 days of the end of the
Company's taxable year in which the liquidation occurs. Such distributions shall
be in cash or Property (which need not be distributed proportionately) or partly
in both, as determined by the Board.

         If at the time of  liquidation  the  Members  shall  determine  that an
immediate  sale of some or all  Company  Property  would cause undue loss to the
Members, the Members may, in order to avoid such loss, defer liquidation.

         11.4  Winding  Up and  Filing  Certificate  of  Cancellation.  Upon the
commencement  of the winding up of the Company,  a certificate  of  cancellation
shall be  delivered  by the  Company to the  Secretary  of State of the State of
Delaware  for  filing.  The  certificate  of  cancellation  shall  set forth the
information  required  by the  Act.  The  winding  up of the  Company  shall  be
completed when all debts,  liabilities  and obligations of the Company have been
paid and discharged or reasonably adequate provision therefor has been made, and
all of the  remaining  Property  of the  Company  has  been  distributed  to the
Members.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                  TRINITECH STOCK ISSUANCE AND PURCHASE OPTION

         12.1 Trinitech  Stock  Issuance.  As  consideration  for the Option (as
defined in Section 12.2 below) Trinitech shall, no later than upon its execution
and delivery of this Agreement,  deliver to each Non-Trinitech Member the number
of shares of common stock of  Trinitech  set forth on such  Member's  respective
signature  page hereto.  Such shares will not initially be registered  under the
Securities  Act, and shall bear a legend to such effect,  in the form determined
by Trinitech.

         12.2 Trinitech  Purchase  Option.  Trinitech shall have the option (the
"Option"),  at any  time  and  from  time to  time,  to  purchase  the  Units of
Membership  Interest  of the  Non-Trinitech  Members,  such that  Trinitech  may
increase  its  Membership  Interest to no more than 80% of the total  Membership
Interest. Trinitech may exercise the Option through the exchange of one share of
Trinitech for each Unit to be  purchased,  subject to adjustment in the event of
any split,  combination,  reclassification  or other  adjustment  to the capital
structure  of  Trinitech.  Any Units  purchased  pursuant to the Option shall be
considered purchased pro rata from the Non-Trinitech  Members according to their
Membership Interests.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         13.1 BHCA Membership Interest. Except as otherwise provided herein, for
the purposes of  calculating  the percentage  Membership  Interest in connection
with any vote  required  herein,  each  BHCA  Member  shall be  deemed to have a
Membership  Interest  which  shall  be the  lesser  of (i)  such  BHCA  Member's
Membership  Interest or (ii) 4.99% of the total Membership  Interest.  Neither a
BHCA Member nor its  Affiliates  may request that such BHCA Member's  Membership
Interest be increased unless such increase is permissible under the BHCA and the
Company  may rely on a  representation  made by a BHCA  Member to the Company to
such effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a BHCA Member's Membership Interest
shall never exceed such Member's Membership Interest.

         13.2   Notices.   Notices  to  the   Company   shall  be  sent  to  the
Administrative  Office of the Company.  Notices to the Members  shall be sent to
the  addresses  set forth on their  respective  signature  page.  Any Member may
require notices to be sent to a different  address by giving notice to the other
Members in accordance with this Section 13.2. Any notice or other  communication
required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have
been given with receipt  confirmed if and when  delivered  personally,  given by
prepaid telegram or mailed first class,  postage prepaid,  delivered by courier,
or sent by facsimile, to such Members at such address.

         13.3 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding  between
them respecting the subject matter of this Agreement.

         13.4  Saving  Clause.  If  any  provision  of  this  Agreement,  or the
application  of such  provision  to any  person or  circumstance,  shall be held
invalid,  the remainder of this Agreement,  or the application of such provision
to persons  or  circumstances  other than those as to which it is held  invalid,
shall not be affected thereby.

         13.5   Counterparts.   This  Agreement  may  be  executed  in  multiple
counterparts,  each of  which  shall be  deemed  an  original,  but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         13.6 Governing Law. The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

         13.7 No Rights of Creditors  and Third  Parties  under  Agreement.  The
Agreement  is entered  into among the Company and the Members for the  exclusive
benefit of the Company,  its Members and their  successors  and  assignees.  The
Agreement  is  expressly  not  intended  for the benefit of any  creditor of the
Company  or any  other  person.  Except  and  only  to the  extent  provided  by
applicable  statute,  no such  creditor or any third party shall have any rights
under the  Agreement  or any  agreement  between the Company and any Member with
respect to any Capital Contribution or otherwise.
