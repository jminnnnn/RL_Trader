ITEM  1.  BUSINESS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks  and uncertainties.  The actual results of American Independence Corp. and
subsidiaries  could  differ  significantly from those set forth herein.  Factors
that  could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited
to,  those  discussed in "Factors Affecting the Company's Operating Results" and
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition and Results of
Operations"  as  well as those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.  Statements  contained  herein  that  are  not  historical  facts  are
forward-looking  statements  that  are subject to the safe harbor created by the
Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995.  Words such as "believes",
"anticipates",  "expects", "intends", "estimates", "likelihood", "unlikelihood",
"assessment"  and  "foreseeable",  and other similar expressions are intended to
identify  forward-looking  statements,  but  are  not  the  exclusive  means  of
identifying  such  statements.  A  number  of  important factors could cause our
actual  results  to differ materially from the statements and those expressed or
implied  in  any  forward-looking  statements  made by us, or on our behalf.  We
undertake  no  obligation  to  release  publicly the results of any revisions to
these  forward-looking  statements  that  may  be  made  to  reflect  events  or
circumstances  after  the  date  hereof  or  to  reflect  the  occurrence  of
unanticipated  events.

On July 30, 2002, SoftNet Systems, Inc., and subsidiaries (collectively referred
to  as  the  "Company")  entered  into  an  agreement  to acquire First Standard
Holdings  Corp.  from  SSH  Corp.  and  Independence Holding Company ("IHC") for
$31,920,000  in  cash.  Subsequently  at  the Special Meeting of Stockholders on
November  14,  2002,  the  Company's  stockholders  approved  the stock purchase
agreement between the Company, SSH Corp. and IHC (the "Purchase Agreement"), and
approved  the  Company's  name  change  to  American Independence Corp.  Also on
November  14, 2002, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase  Agreement  and  First  Standard  Holdings  Corp.  changed  its name to
Independence  American  Holdings  Corp.  ("IAHC").  IAHC  and  its  wholly-owned
subsidiaries  are  engaged  in  the  insurance  and  reinsurance  business.  The
Company,  which  was a holding company principally engaged in providing Internet
services,  had  previously  wound  down its Internet related businesses and as a
result  of  the  acquisition  of  IAHC  has become an insurance holding company.
Additionally,  due  to the acquisition of IAHC, the Company has decided to close
its  offices in San Francisco, terminate all but one of its employees, and enter
into  a services agreement with IHC under which the Company's operations will be
directed  by  IHC  management  and  employees.  The  transaction  is  more fully
described in the Company's Definitive Proxy/Prospectus Statement on Schedule 14A
as  filed  with  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission  on  September  30, 2002.

In  a  separate  transaction  on  July  30,  2002,  IHC acquired Pacific Century
Cyberworks  Limited's  ("PCCW")  entire  interest  in  the Company consisting of
5,000,000  common  stock  shares  at  $3.00  per  share  for  a  total  value of
$15,000,000.  As  a  result  of  this  transaction, PCCW's appointees Linus W.L.
Cheung and Jeffrey A. Bowden resigned from the Company's Board of Directors, and
Edward  Netter,  Chairman  of  IHC,  and  Roy  T.K.  Thung,  President and Chief
Executive  Officer  of  IHC, were appointed to the Company's Board of Directors.
Additionally,  upon  closing  of  the purchase of IAHC, IHC has agreed to make a
cash  tender  offer at $3.00 per share for at least 3,000,000 outstanding common
stock  shares  of  the Company, subject to certain limitations, by no later than
February  18,  2003.

On  May  17,  2002,  the  Company  received  a Nasdaq Staff Determination Letter
stating  that  the  Company's  common stock was no longer eligible for continued
listing  on  the  Nasdaq  National Market as a result of the Company ceasing the
operations  of  its  last  business  segment,  Intellicom,  and that the Company
therefore  did  not  meet  the  requirements  for continued listing set forth in
Marketplace  Rules  4300  and 4330.  Subsequently, the Company requested and was
granted  an  oral hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to appeal
the  Nasdaq  Staff  Determination  Letter,  which  stayed  the  delisting of the
Company's  common  stock  pending the outcome of the hearing.  On July 12, 2002,
the  Company  appeared before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to present
the Company's plan to acquire IAHC, which would allow the Company to comply with
the  Marketplace  Rules  4300  and 4330.  On August 15, 2002, the Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel informed the Company that the Company will remain listed on
Nasdaq,  subject  to meeting various conditions, including the completion of the
acquisition  of IAHC by December 31, 2002.  Nasdaq has also informed the Company
that  if it does remain listed on Nasdaq, following the acquisition of IAHC, the
Company  will  be required to meet Nasdaq's initial listing requirements as well
as  Nasdaq's  continued  listing  requirements.

As  of September 30, 2002, the Company had substantially completed the wind down
of  its  Internet  services  related  subsidiaries,  ISP  Channel,  Inc.  ("ISP
Channel"),  Intelligent  Communications,  Inc.  ("Intellicom"),  and  Aerzone
Corporation  ("Aerzone"),  including  Laptop  Lane Limited ("Laptop Lane"), as a
result  of  the  following:

On  December  7,  2000,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors approved a plan to
discontinue  its  ISP Channel operations because of (1) the consolidation in the
cable  industry  made  it  difficult for ISP Channel to achieve the economies of
scale  necessary to provide such services profitably, and (2) the Company was no
longer  able  to bear the costs of maintaining the ISP Channel.  Subsequently on
December  19,  2000,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  approved  a  plan to
discontinue  its  Aerzone,  including  Laptop  Lane, business in light of, among
other things, significant long-term capital needs and the difficulty of securing
the  necessary  financing because of the financial markets.  In conjunction with
discontinuing  the  ISP  Channel  and Aerzone businesses, the Company's Board of
Directors  on  December  28,  2000,  approved  a  plan  to  reduce its corporate
headquarters  staff.

On  March  29,  2002,  the  Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Intellicom,
entered  into  an agreement to sell its operating business and certain assets to
Loral  Cyberstar, Inc.  Following the sale of its operating business and certain
assets  to  Loral  Cyberstar, Inc., the Company's Board of Directors unanimously
agreed  to cease the operations of Intellicom on April 3, 2002.  Subsequently on
April  22,  2002, Intellicom entered into an agreement to sell certain assets to
Native  Intellicom,  Inc.,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Pinoleville Band of
Pomo Indians, for cash, subject to the termination of Intellicom's lease for its
facility in Livermore, California.  On August 1, 2002, Intellicom terminated the
agreement  with  the Pinoleville Band of Pomo Indians and is negotiating to sell
those  assets  to  another  group  of  Native  Americans.

EMPLOYEES

The  Company  had  9  employees  at  October  31,  2002.

FACILITIES

The  Company's  principal executive office is located at 485 Madison Avenue, New
York,  New York 10022.  The Company is currently in negotiations to sublease its
previous  principal  executive office located at 650 Townsend Street, Suite 225,
San  Francisco,  California  94103.

                      INDEPENDENCE AMERICAN HOLDINGS CORP.

Prior to its acquisition by the Company, Independence American Holdings Corp., a
Delaware  corporation, and it subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "IAHC"),
were  an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of IHC. IAHC is engaged principally in
the  health  insurance  and  reinsurance  business  through  its  wholly-owned
subsidiaries; Independence American Insurance Company ("Independence American"),
formerly  First  Standard Insurance Corp.; IndependenceCare Holdings LLC and its
subsidiaries  (collectively  referred  to  as  "IndependenceCare");  and  Risk
Assessment  Strategies,  Inc.  ("RAS").

PRINCIPAL  PRODUCT  AND  SERVICES

Independence  American  Insurance  Company

Independence  American,  which  is  domiciled  in Delaware, is licensed to write
property and/or casualty insurance in 24 states, and has a B+ (Very Good) rating
from  A.M.  Best  & Company, Inc ("A.M. Best").  An A.M. Best rating is assigned
after  an  extensive  quantitative  and  qualitative  evaluation  of a company's
financial  condition  and  operating performance, and is also based upon factors
relevant  to  policyholders,  agents,  and  intermediaries,  and is not directed
toward  protection  of  investors.  A.M. Best ratings are not recommendations to
buy,  sell  or  hold  securities  of  IAHC.

Independence  American  reinsures  employer  medical  stop-loss  insurance  for
self-insured  group  medical  plans.  Self-insured  plans  permit  employers
flexibility  in  designing employee health coverages at a cost that may be lower
than  that  available  through other health care plans provided by an insurer or
Health  Maintenance  Organization  ("HMO"). Employer medical stop-loss insurance
allows  self-insured  employers to manage the risk of excessive health insurance
costs under self funded plans by limiting the employer's health care expenses to
a  predetermined  amount.  This  stop-loss  coverage  is  available  on either a
"specific"  or  a  "specific  and  aggregate" basis. Specific stop-loss coverage
reimburses  employers  from  large  claims incurred by an individual employee or
dependent.  When  an  employee or dependent's covered claims exceed the specific
stop-loss  deductible,  covered  amounts  in  excess  of  the  deductible  are
reimbursable  to  the employer under the specific stop-loss policy. The specific
stop-loss  deductible  is selected based on the number of covered employees, the
employer's capacity to assume some of the risk, and the medical claim experience
of  the  plan.  Aggregate  stop-loss  coverage  protects  the  employer  against
fluctuations  due  to claim frequency. The employer's overall claim liability is
limited  to  a certain dollar amount, often referred to as the attachment point.
An aggregate stop-loss policy usually provides reimbursement when covered claims
for  the  plan  as a whole exceed the attachment point. Approximately 50% of the
stop-loss  policies  Independence American reinsures cover specific claims only.
Employer  medical  stop-loss  is  a  "short-tail"  business  which  means  that
substantially  all  claims  will  have  been  paid  within eighteen months after
inception  of  a  policy.

Independence  American  has  entered  into  reinsurance  treaties  with Standard
Security  Life  Insurance  Company  of  New  York  ("Standard Life") and Madison
National  Life  insurance  Company,  Inc.  ("Madison  Life")  pursuant  to which
Standard  Life and Madison Life, respectively, will cede, at treaty renewals, at
least 15% of their employer medical stop-loss business to Independence American.
Standard  Life  and  Madison  Life  are  wholly-owned  subsidiaries of IHC.  The
reinsurance treaties between Independence American and Standard Life, on the one
hand,  and  Independence American and Madison Life, on the other hand, terminate
December  31, 2014, unless sooner terminated by Independence American.  Standard
Life,  which  is  domiciled  in  New York, has an A (Excellent) rating from A.M.
Best,  and is licensed as an insurance company in all 50 states, the District of
Columbia,  the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.  Madison Life, which is domiciled
in  Wisconsin,  has an A- (Excellent) rating from A.M. Best, is licensed to sell
insurance  products  in  46  states,  the  District  of  Columbia and the Virgin
Islands,  and is an accredited reinsurer in New York.  Standard Life and Madison
Life market employer medical stop-loss insurance nationally through a network of
managing  general  underwriters  ("MGUs"), who are non-salaried contractors that
receive  administrative  fees.  Standard  Life  currently  markets  this product
through  11  MGUs,  including  IndependenceCare and RAS.  Madison Life currently
markets  through  2  MGUs.  MGUs  are responsible for establishing an employer's
conditions for coverage in accordance with guidelines formulated and approved by
Standard  Life  and  Madison  Life,  billing  and  collecting  premiums from the
employers,  paying  commissions  to  third  party administrators ("TPAs") and/or
brokers,  and  adjudicating  claims.   Standard  Life   and  Madison   Life  are
responsible   for   selecting   MGUs,   establishing   underwriting  guidelines,
maintaining  approved  policy  forms  and  reviewing   and  medically   managing
employers'  claims  for  reimbursement,  as  well  as  establishing  appropriate
accounting  procedures  and  reserves.

Managed  Care  Excess  Coverage

Independence  American issues and reinsures managed care excess coverages, which
includes  provider  excess  loss  insurance  and  HMO  reinsurance.

Provider  Excess  Loss  Insurance  and  Reinsurance

Independence  American  issues and reinsures provider excess loss insurance on a
specific  loss  basis only.  This product is marketed to providers, managed care
organizations,  including  provider  hospital  organizations,  hospital  groups,
physician groups and individual practice associations (collectively "MCOs") that
have  assumed  risk  (through  capitation  by an HMO or otherwise) and desire to
reduce  their  risk  assumption  and/or  are  required  to  purchase coverage by
contract  or  regulation.

Independence  American  is licensed in 24 states and has begun to write provider
excess  loss  insurance  in certain of these states through IndependenceCare and
another MGU that specializes in this product.  IndependenceCare and this MGU are
responsible  for  marketing,  underwriting, billing and collecting premiums, and
medically  managing,  administering  and  adjudicating  claims.  Independence
American  also  reinsures  provider  excess  loss  insurance  written  through
IndependenceCare  and  this  other  MGU  and  issued  by Standard Life and other
carriers  on  a  specific  loss  basis  only.

HMO  Reinsurance

Independence  American  reinsures  HMO  Reinsurance  coverage  written  through
Standard  Life  and  marketed by IndependenceCare.  This coverage protects HMO's
against excess losses incurred under an HMO health plan and is marketed to HMO's
who  desire  to  reduce  their  risk  assumption and/or are required to purchase
coverage  by  contract  or  regulation.

Managing  General  Underwriters

IndependenceCare  is  an MGU for the employer medical stop-loss, provider excess
loss  and  HMO  Reinsurance products of Standard Life and Independence American.
IndependenceCare  has  agreements  with  other carriers to write business on its
behalf  in  the event of marketing conflicts or regulatory requirements.  During
the  first quarter of 2001, IndependenceCare acquired the business and employees
of  two  other  managed  care  MGUs  and,  during  the first quarter of 2002, it
acquired  the  business  and  employees  of  a  medical  stop-loss  MGU.
IndependenceCare  currently  has  three operating subsidiaries, IndependenceCare
Underwriting  Services  -  Minneapolis  L.L.C.,  IndependenceCare  Underwriting
Services  -  Tennessee  L.L.C.  and  IndependenceCare  Underwriting  Services  -
Southwest  L.L.C.  IndependenceCare's  experienced  staff  is  responsible  for
marketing, underwriting, billing and collecting premiums and medically managing,
administering  and  adjudicating  claims.  Final  authority  for  all  financial
decisions  remains  with  the  carrier.

RAS  is  an  MGU for employer medical stop-loss and group life for Standard Life
and  another  carrier.  RAS,  which  is based in South Windsor, Connecticut, has
experienced  marketing,  underwriting  and  claims  personnel.

REINSURANCE  INDUSTRY

Reinsurance  is  an  arrangement  in  which an insurance company, the reinsurer,
agrees  to  indemnify another insurance company, the ceding company, against all
or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one
or  more  insurance  contracts.  Reinsurance  can  provide a ceding company with
several  benefits,  including  a  reduction  in  net  liability on individual or
classes  of  risks,  catastrophe  protection  from  large or multiple losses and
assistance  in  maintaining  acceptable  financial  ratios.  Reinsurance  also
provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it
to accept larger risks and write more business than would be possible without an
accompanying  increase  in  capital and surplus.  Reinsurance, however, does not
discharge  the  ceding  company  from  its  liability  to  policyholders.

There  are  two  basic types of reinsurance arrangements: treaty and facultative
reinsurance.  In treaty reinsurance, the ceding company is obligated to cede and
the  reinsurer  is obligated to assume a specified portion of a type of category
of  risks  insured  by  the ceding company.  Treaty reinsurers do not separately
evaluate  each  of  the  individual  risks  assumed  under  their  treaties and,
consequently, after a review of the ceding company's underwriting practices, are
largely dependent on the original risk underwriting decisions made by the ceding
company.  In facultative reinsurance, the ceding company cedes and the reinsurer
assumes  all or part of the risk under a single insurance contract.  Facultative
reinsurance  is  negotiated  separately  for  each  insurance  contract  that is
reinsured.  Facultative  reinsurance  normally  is purchased by ceding companies
for  individual  risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties, for amounts in
excess of the dollar limits of their reinsurance treaties and for unusual risks.


                                      -4-
<PAGE>
Both  treaty  and  facultative  reinsurance  can be written on either a pro rata
basis  or  an  excess  of  loss  basis.  Under  pro rata reinsurance, the ceding
company  and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses
in  an  agreed  proportion.  Under  excess  of  loss  reinsurance, the reinsurer
indemnifies  the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and
expenses  in  excess of a specified dollar amount, known as the ceding company's
retention  or  reinsurer's  attachment  point, generally subject to a negotiated
reinsurance  contract  limit.

Premiums  paid  by  the  ceding  company  to  a  reinsurer  for  excess  of loss
reinsurance  are  not  directly  proportional  to  the  premiums that the ceding
company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk.  In
pro  rata  reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding
commission.  The  ceding  commission  generally is based on the ceding company's
cost  of  acquiring  the  business  being reinsured (commissions, premium taxes,
assessments  and  miscellaneous  administrative  expenses).  There is usually no
ceding  commission  on  excess  of  loss  reinsurance.

Reinsurers  may  purchase  reinsurance  to  cover  their  own  risk  exposure.
Reinsurance  of  a  reinsurer's  business is called a retrocession.  Reinsurance
companies  cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers, known
as  retrocessionaires,  for  reasons  similar  to  those  that cause insurers to
purchase reinsurance: to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks,
protect  against  catastrophic  losses,  stabilize  financial  ratios and obtain
additional  underwriting  capacity.

RESERVES  AND  INVESTMENTS

Independence  American's securities portfolio is managed by employees of IHC and
its  affiliates,  and  ultimate  investment  authority  rests  with Independence
American's  Board  of  Directors.  As  a  result  of the nature of its insurance
liabilities,  Independence  American  endeavors  to  maintain  a  significant
percentage  of  its  assets  in  investment  grade  securities,  cash  and  cash
equivalents.  At  December  31, 2001, approximately 100% of the fixed maturities
were  investment  grade. The internal investment group provides a summary of the
investment portfolio and the performance thereof at the meetings of IAHC's board
of  directors.

As required by insurance laws and regulations, Independence American establishes
reserves  to  meet obligations on policies in-force.  These reserves are amounts
which  are  calculated  to  be  sufficient  to  meet  anticipated  future policy
obligations.  Premiums  and  reserves  are  based  upon certain assumptions with
respect  to  morbidity.  Independence American invests its assets, which support
the  reserves and other funds in accordance with applicable insurance law, under
the  supervision of their respective boards of directors.  IAHC manages interest
rate  risk seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that
falls  within  the  band  of  the  duration  and  average life of the applicable
liabilities.

Under  Delaware insurance law, there are restrictions relating to the percentage
of  an insurer's admitted assets that may be invested in a specific issuer or in
the  aggregate  in  a  particular  type  of  investment.  In addition, there are
qualitative  investment  restrictions.

COMPETITION  AND  REGULATION

Independence  American  competes  with  many  larger  insurance  and reinsurance
companies and managed care organizations.  IndependenceCare and RAS compete with
many  other  managing  general underwriters, insurance companies, HMOs and other
managed  care  organizations.

IAHC  is  an insurance holding company; as such, it is subject to regulation and
supervision  by  the  insurance  supervisory agencies of Delaware.  Independence
American  is  also subject to regulation and supervision in all jurisdictions in
which  it  is  licensed  to  transact business.  These supervisory agencies have
broad  administrative  powers  with  respect  to  the granting and revocation of
licenses  to  transact business, the licensing of agents, the approval of policy
forms,  the  approval  of  commission  rates,  the form and content of mandatory
financial  statements, reserve requirements and the types and maximum amounts of
investments  which  may  be made.  Such regulation is designed primarily for the
benefit of policyholders rather than the stockholders of an insurance company or
holding  company.

Certain  transactions  within  the  holding  company  system are also subject to
regulation  and  supervision by such regulatory agencies.  All such transactions
must  be  fair  and  equitable.  Notice  to  or  prior approval by the insurance
department  is  required with respect to transactions affecting the ownership or


                                      -5-

control  of  an insurer and of certain material transactions, including dividend
declarations,  between  an insurer and any person in its holding company system.
Under  Delaware insurance laws, "control" is defined as the possession, directly
or  indirectly,  of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management
and  policies  of  a person, and is presumed to exist if any person, directly or
indirectly,  owns,  controls or holds with the power to vote ten percent or more
of  the  voting securities of any other person.  An agreement to acquire control
of  an  insurer  domiciled  in  Delaware must be approved by the Commissioner of
Insurance  of Delaware.  In addition, periodic disclosure is required concerning
the  operations,  management  and  financial condition of the insurer within the
holding  company  system.  An  insurer  is also required to file detailed annual
statements  with  each  supervisory  agency,  and  its  affairs  and  financial
conditions  are  subject  to  periodic  examination.

Risk-based  capital  requirements are imposed on property and casualty insurance
companies.  The  risk-based capital ratio is determined by dividing an insurance
company's  total  adjusted  capital, as defined, by its authorized control level
risk-based  capital.  Companies  that  do  not  meet  certain  minimum standards
require  specified  corrective  action.  The  risk-based  capital  ratio  for
Independence  American  exceeds  such  minimum  ratios.

EMPLOYEES

As of October 31, 2002, IAHC has 31 employees.

adverse  effect  on  the  financial  position  of  IAHC.

ITEM  3.  LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS

On  September 26, 2001, Lucent Technologies Inc. ("Lucent") brought an action in
San  Francisco  Superior  Court  against  American  Independence Corp., formerly
SoftNet  Systems,  Inc.,  and  subsidiaries  (collectively  referred  to  as the
"Company"), alleging that the Company breached a contract by failing to purchase
Lucent's  shares in Freewire Networks, Inc. ("Freewire") and claiming damages of
approximately $3.5 million, which may increase over time.  On December 31, 2001,
the  San  Francisco  Superior Court issued an order to deny Lucent's application
for  writ  of  attachment,  finding  that  Lucent  had  not  shown a substantial
probability that it will prevail on its claim.  The Company continues to believe
that Lucent's claims are without merit and will contest these claims vigorously.

On  November  9, 2001, Nokia Inc. ("Nokia") commenced an action in San Francisco
Superior Court against the Company and Aerzone Corporation ("Aerzone"), alleging
breach  of  contract arising out of the Aerzone's proposed operations in certain
airports.  Nokia  seeks  approximately  $2.1  million  in  damages.  The Company
believes  that  Nokia's  claims  are  without merit and intends to contest these
claims  vigorously.  Additionally,  the Company deposited security collateral of
$1,053,000  as  required  by  the  performance bond indemnity agreement with the
surety  company.  In  the  event  that  the Company prevails, any balance on the
collateral  will  be  returned  by  the  surety  company  to  the  Company.

On  October  30,  2001, Global Information Distribution GmbH ("GID") commenced a
demand  for  arbitration  against  the  Company, alleging breach of contract and
warranties  relating  to the sale of Micrographic Technology Corporation ("MTC")
to  GID  on  September  30, 1999.  GID claims approximately $750,000 in damages.
The Company believes GID's claims are without merit and intends to contest these
claims  vigorously.

The  Company is also involved in other legal proceedings and claims, which arise
in the ordinary course of its discontinued businesses.  The Company believes the
results  of  the  above noted legal proceedings, other pending legal proceedings
and  claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on its results of
operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows.

There  are  various  lawsuits  pending  against IAHC in the normal course of its
insurance  business.  IAHC's  management  is  of  the  opinion that the ultimate
liabilities  arising  from  such  litigation,  if any, would not have a material
adverse  effect  on  the  financial  position  of  IAHC.

At  October  31,  2002,  there  were  407 record holders of the Company's common
stock.  The  closing  price  for the Company's common stock at October 31, 2002,
was  $2.39.

On July 30, 2002, the Company's Board of Directors approved a shareholder rights
plan  (the  "Plan").  Pursuant  to  the  Plan's approval, the Company's Board of
Directors declared a dividend distribution of one Preferred Share Purchase Right
(the  "Rights")  on  each  outstanding  common  stock  share.  The  dividend
distribution  of  the  Rights  will  be  payable to common stock stockholders of
record  on  August  14,  2002.  The  Rights  distribution  is  not  taxable  to
stockholders.  Subject  to limited exceptions, the Rights will be exercisable if
a  person or group acquires or announces a tender offer for 4.99% or more of the
Company's  common  stock.  Under  certain circumstances, each Right will entitle
shareholders  to  buy  one  one-hundredth  of  a share of newly created Series A
Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock  of  the Company at an exercise price of
$3.00.  The  Company's  Board of Directors will be entitled to redeem the Rights
at $0.01 per Right at any time before a person has acquired 4.99% or more of the
outstanding  common  stock.

The  Rights  are  designed  to inhibit some acquisitions of the Company's common
stock  shares  that  could result in the imposition of limitations on the use of
its  Federal  net  operating  loss carryforwards and certain income tax credits.
The Rights are also intended to enable all stockholders to realize the long-term
value  of their investment in the Company.  The Rights are not being distributed
in  response  to  any  specific  effort  to acquire control of the Company.  The
Rights  are  designed  to  help  protect  the  tax  benefits associated with the
Company's  net  operating  loss  carryforwards.

If  a  person becomes an Acquiring Person, each Right will entitle its holder to
purchase,  at the Right's then-current exercise price, a number of the Company's
common  shares  having a market value at that time of twice the Right's exercise
price.  The Rights held by the Acquiring Person will become void and will not be
exercisable  to  purchase  shares  at the bargain purchase price.  If Company is
acquired  in  a  merger  or other business combination transaction which has not
been  approved  by the Company's Board of Directors, each Right will entitle its
holder  to purchase, at the Right's then-current exercise price, a number of the
acquiring  company's  common  shares having a market value at that time of twice
the  Right's  exercise  price.

The  Plan  will  expire on the close of business on the earliest date that (a) a
vote of Company's stockholders does not approve an amendment or an amendment and
restatement  of  the  Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation  proposed by the
Company's Board of Directors providing for limitations on the acquisition of the
Company's  common  stock  in  excess  of  certain  percentage  amounts, (b) such
restated  Certificate  of  Incorporation is filed with the Secretary of State of
the  State  of  Delaware  or (c) the Company's stock purchase agreement with SSH
Corp.  and IHC is terminated, subject to the Company's right to extend such date
and  the  Company's earlier redemption or exchange of such rights or termination
of  the  Plan.


                                      -8-

Subsequently,  as a result of the approval of the Company's amended and restated
Certificate  of  Incorporation  by  the  Company's  stockholders  at the Special
Meeting  of  Stockholders  on  November  14,  2002,  and  filing of the restated
Certificate  of  Incorporation  with  the  Secretary  of  State  of the State of
Delaware,  the  Plan  expired.

Other  than  restrictions  that  may  be  part  of various debt instruments, the
Company  does  not  have  any  legal  restriction  on  paying  dividends.

RECENT  SALES  OF  UNREGISTERED  SECURITIES

On  September  15, 1995, in association with the acquisition of MTC, the Company
assumed  $1,800,000  of  6%  Convertible  Subordinated  Secured  Debentures  due
February 28, 2002.  These 6% debentures were subject to redemption at the option
of the Company at face value, provided however, that the Company issued warrants
to purchase common stock shares for the same number of shares as would have been
issued if the debentures were converted.  These debentures were convertible into
the  Company's common stock at $8.10 per share.  These securities were issued in
a  non-public offering pursuant to transactions exempt under Section 4(2) of the
Securities  Act of 1993, as amended (the "Securities Act").  As of September 30,
1999,  the Company issued 140,739 common stock shares pursuant to the conversion
of  $1,140,000  of  these  convertible debentures.  Subsequently on November 15,
2000,  the  remaining  principal  of  $660,000  and  accrued  interest was paid.

On  September  15,  1995,  the  Company  issued $2,856,000 of its 9% Convertible
Subordinated  Debentures  due  September  15,  2000,  in  conjunction  with  the
acquisition  of  MTC.  The  debentures were issued to the shareholders of MTC as
partial consideration for the acquisition.  These 9% debentures had a conversion
price  of $6.75.  These securities were issued in a non-public offering pursuant
to  transactions  exempt  under  Section  4(2)  of  the  Securities  Act.  As of
September  30,  1999, the Company issued 222,200 common stock shares pursuant to
the  conversion of $1,499,000 of these debentures.  For the year ended September
30,  2000,  the  Company  issued  1,467  common  stock  shares  pursuant  to the
conversion  of  $63,000  of  convertible  debt  by two separate holders of these
debentures.  On September 15, 2000, the Company paid the remaining $1,294,000 of
convertible  debt  and  accrued  interest  in  cash.

On  January  2,  1998,  the Company issued $1,444,000 principal amount of its 5%
Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures  due  September  30,  2002,  to Mr. R.C.W.
Mauran,  who  was at the time of the transaction a beneficial owner of more than
5%  of the Company's common stock, in exchange for the assignment to the Company
of  certain  equipment  leases  and  other  consideration, all of which had been
assimilated  into  the  business  of  Micrographic  Technology Corporation.  The
debentures  were  convertible into the Company's common stock at $8.25 per share
after  December 31, 1998.  These securities were issued in a non-public offering
pursuant  to  transactions  exempt under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.  On
September  30,  2002,  the  Company paid the principal of $1,444,000 and accrued
interest  in  cash.

On  January  12,  1999,  the  Company  issued  $12,000,000  of  its  9%  Senior
Subordinated  Convertible Notes (the "Notes") due January 1, 2001, to a group of
institutional investors.  These Notes were convertible into the Company's common
stock  with  an initial conversion price of $17.00 per share until July 1, 1999,
and,  thereafter,  at  the  lower  of  $17.00 per share (the "Initial Conversion
Price")  and  the  lowest  five-day  average  closing bid price of the Company's
common  stock  during  the  30-day  trading  period  ending one day prior to the
applicable  conversion  date (the "Conversion Price").  In connection with these
Notes,  the  Company issued to these investors warrants to purchase an aggregate
of  300,000  shares  of  the  Company's  common  stock.  These  warrants have an
exercise  price of $17.00 per share and expire in 2003.  On April 28, 1999, as a
result  of  the Company's underwritten secondary public offering (the "Secondary
Offering"),  and  in conjunction with an anti-dilution provision associated with
the  Notes,  the  Initial Conversion Price was reduced from $17.00 to $16.49 per
share.  Furthermore,  in order to secure three month lock-up agreements from the
holders  of  the  Notes  in conjunction with the Secondary Offering, the Company
entered into a new arrangement with the holders of the Notes to issue all future
interest  payments,  beginning with the three months ended June 30, 1999, in the
form  of  convertible notes with substantially the same form and features as the
original  Notes.  Therefore, the Company issued an additional $549,000 in notes,
representing interest for the six months ended September 30, 1999 (the "Interest
Notes").  The  Notes  and  warrants were issued in a nonpublic offering pursuant
Regulation  D  under  the  Securities  Act.  On  October 22, 1999, all of the 9%
Senior  Subordinated  Convertible  Notes,  related  Interest  Notes  and accrued
interest  were  converted  into  765,201  common  stock  shares  of the Company.

On  February  9,  1999, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and
into  Intellicom (the "Intellicom Acquisition").  The Intellicom Acquisition was
accounted for under the purchase method, and the results of Intellicom have been
included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
The  purchase  price  of  $14,869,000  was comprised of: (i) a cash component of


                                      -9-
<PAGE>
$500,000  (the  "Cash  Consideration");  (ii) a promissory note in the amount of
$1,000,000  bearing  interest  at  7.5% per annum and due one year after closing
(the  "First  Promissory  Note");  (iii)  a  promissory  note  in  the amount of
$2,000,000  bearing  interest  at 8.5% per annum and due two years after closing
(the  "Second  Promissory  Note",  together  with  the First Promissory Note are
defined  as  "Debt  Consideration");  (iv) the issuance of 500,000 shares of the
Company's  common  stock  (adjustable  upwards  after  one  year  in  certain
circumstances),  valued  at  $14.938  per share, for a total value of $7,469,000
(the  "Closing  Shares");  (v)  additional  shares of the Company's common stock
issuable  upon  the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing, valued
at  a  total  of $3,500,000 (the "Anniversary Shares", together with the Closing
Shares  are  defined  as  "Equity  Consideration");  and  (vi)  certain  direct
acquisition costs totaling $400,000.  The Debt Consideration may be partially or
wholly  converted  into the Company's common stock, under certain circumstances.
The  conversion  price  of  the  Debt  Consideration  was based upon the average
closing  price  of  the  Company's  common  stock  for  the  15 days immediately
preceding  the  conversion  date.  In  April  1999,  the  Company paid the First
Promissory  Note  and related interest in full with a combination of $832,000 in
cash and the remainder, after expenses, with 6,118 common stock shares valued at
$190,000.  The  Intellicom  Acquisition  agreement required the Company to issue
$1,500,000  of  common  stock  shares  on  the  first  anniversary  date  of the
Intellicom  Acquisition.  Accordingly,  on  February 8, 2000, the Company issued
43,314  common  stock shares valued at $1,499,000 and paid $1,000 for fractional
shares  to the former Intellicom stockholders.  On February 7, 2001, the Company
made  an  offer to the former Intellicom stockholders to pay a discounted amount
in  lieu  of  the  Company's  obligation to pay cash and stock for the remaining
consideration,  which  was  to  be  paid  in  connection  with  the  Intellicom
acquisition  and  consisted of (i) a $2,000,000 8.5% promissory note and accrued
interest,  (ii)  the  requirement  for the Company to issue $1,500,000 of common
stock  shares  on the second anniversary date of the Intellicom acquisition, and
(iii)  the  requirement for the Company to issue $500,000 of common stock shares
on the third anniversary date of the Intellicom acquisition.  The parties agreed
to settle the obligation by which the Company paid $2,815,000 (including accrued
interest of $325,000), issued 99,922 common stock shares valued at $199,000, and
recognized  a  $1,326,000  extraordinary  gain  on  settlements  of  outstanding
obligations.  On February 9, 2002, the Company issued 12,426 common stock shares
to  settle  the remaining obligations related to the requirement to issue common
stock  shares on the third anniversary date of the Intellicom acquisition.  Both
the  Debt  Consideration and the Equity Consideration were issued in a nonpublic
offering  pursuant  to  transactions exempt under Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act.

On  February 22, 1999, the Company entered into a license agreement with Inktomi
Corporation  ("Inktomi", the "Inktomi Licensing Agreement") allowing the Company
rights  to  install  certain  Inktomi  caching  technology  into  the  Company's
cable-based  Internet  network  infrastructure.  Additionally,  the  Inktomi
Licensing  Agreement  allowed  the  Company  to  purchase  up  to 500 additional
licenses  during  the  first four years of the agreement.  The Inktomi Licensing
Agreement  was  valued  at  $4,000,000 for a total of 500 licenses, of which the
first $1,000,000 was paid with 65,843 common stock shares of the Company and the
remaining  amount  payable in cash in eight quarterly payments of $375,000.  For
the  years  ended  September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, total payments amounted to
$750,000,  $1,500,000  and  $750,000,  respectively.  Prepaid  license fees were
$2,602,000  at September 30, 2000.  As a result of the Company discontinuing the
operations  of  ISP Channel, prepaid license fees were written off and reflected
in  the  loss  on  disposition  of  discontinued  operations  for the year ended
September  30,  2000.  Payments  for  the  year  ended  September 30, 2001, were
charged  directly to the net liabilities associated with discontinued operations
of  ISP  Channel,  Inc.  of  the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  These
common stock shares were issued in a nonpublic offering pursuant to transactions
exempt  under  Section  4(2)  of  the  Securities  Act.

On  March  22,  1999, the Company issued warrants to purchase 3,013 common stock
shares  to  an  institutional  lender  in  connection  with  a $3,000,000 credit
facility.  The  credit  facility  was  used  to  fund  certain capital equipment
acquisitions.  The  warrants  have  an  exercise  price of $29.875 and expire on
March  22,  2003.  These securities were issued in a nonpublic offering pursuant
to  transactions  exempt  under  Section  4(2)  of  the  Securities  Act.

In  conjunction  with  offering  incentives  to launch the Company's ISP Channel
cable-based  Internet  services,  the  Company  issued  common  stock  to  cable
affiliates  in  return  for the exclusive rights to provide Internet services to
their  customers.  During  the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company issued
an  aggregate of 13,574 common stock shares valued at $337,000 to eight separate
cable  affiliates.  During the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company issued
35,160  common stock shares valued at $419,000 to two separate cable affiliates.
In  addition,  on April 12, 1999, the Company issued 660,000 common stock shares
to  an  investor  for  $14,990,000  in  cash and a modification of the affiliate
agreement between the Company and Teleponce Cable TV, which is controlled by the
investor;  the  modification of the affiliate agreement was valued at $8,925,000
as  a  cable  affiliate  launch  incentive.  Further,  on  November 4, 1999, the
Company  entered  into  various  definitive  agreements  with  Mediacom  LLC


                                      -10-

("Mediacom").  In  exchange  for  signing an agreement to launch the ISP Channel
services,  the  Company  issued  a  total  of  3,500,000  common stock shares to
Mediacom,  of  which  3,150,000  common  stock  shares  were  restricted.  The
restrictions  were  progressively  lifted  as  Mediacom  launched  ISP Channel's
services  in  Mediacom's cable television systems.  At September 30, 2000, there
were  2,100,000  common  stock shares restricted and unvalued.  The unrestricted
1,400,000  common  stock  shares were valued at $26,513,000 as a cable affiliate
launch  incentive.  As  a  result of the Company discontinuing the operations of
ISP  Channel,  the  cable  affiliate  launch incentive, net of amortization, was
written  off and reflected in the loss on disposition of discontinued operations
for  the  year  ended  September 30, 2000, and in the net assets associated with
discontinued  operations  at  September  30,  1999.  On  February  16, 2001, the
Company  and  ISP  Channel  entered  into agreements with Mediacom, to terminate
Mediacom's affiliate relationship with ISP Channel.  As part of these agreements
Mediacom released all obligations under the affiliate agreement with ISP Channel
and  returned  1,300,000  restricted  common stock shares of the Company, and in
exchange  received certain equipment, a $3,768,000 payment from the Company, and
the  Company  removed  restrictions  on  800,000  common  stock shares valued at
$1,500,000  held  by  Mediacom.  Mediacom  currently  holds a total of 2,200,000
unrestricted  common stock shares of the Company.  Pursuant to these agreements,
neither  the  Company  nor  ISP  Channel  has any further material obligation to
Mediacom.  These  common  stock  shares  were  issued  in  a  nonpublic offering
pursuant  to  transactions  exempt  under  Section  4(2)  of the Securities Act.

On  December  13,  1999,  the Company completed a private placement of 5,000,000
common  stock  shares  for  net  proceeds  of  $128,121,000  to  Pacific Century
Cyberworks  Limited  ("PCCW"),  and  entitled  PCCW to designate two persons for
election  to the Board of Directors.  These common stock shares were issued in a
nonpublic  offering  pursuant  to  transactions exempt under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act.  On July 30, 2002, Independence Holding Company ("IHC") acquired
PCCW  entire interest in the Company consisting of 5,000,000 common stock shares
at  $3.00  per  share  for  a  total  value of $15,000,000.  As a result of this
transaction,  PCCW's appointees Linus W.L. Cheung and Jeffrey A. Bowden resigned
from  the  Company's Board of Directors, and Edward Netter, Chairman of IHC, and
Roy  T.K. Thung, Chief Executive Officer of IHC, were appointed to the Company's
Board of Directors.  Additionally, IHC has agreed to make a cash tender offer at
$3.00  per  share  for at least 3,000,000 outstanding common stock shares of the
Company,  subject  to  certain  limitations.

On  April  21, 2000, the Company acquired Laptop Lane Limited ("Laptop Lane"), a
Washington corporation, under the purchase method of accounting, and the results
of Laptop Lane have been included in the consolidated financial statements since
the date of acquisition.  Laptop Lane was a provider of business center services
in  airports.  The  Company  paid  approximately  $21,559,000  consisting of (i)
972,266  common  stock  shares  of  the  Company  valued  at $15,107,000, net of
adjustment  for expenses paid by the Company on behalf of Laptop Lane, exchanged
for  all outstanding common stock shares of Laptop Lane, (ii) direct acquisition
costs of approximately $2,300,000, which included a bonus payment to Laptop Lane
employees  of  $431,000  in lieu of Laptop Lane stock options, and (iii) 250,000
common  stock shares of the Company valued at $3,652,000 issued to former Laptop
Lane  stockholders  in  payment  for achieving certain criteria.  As part of the
acquisition, an additional 333,333 common stock shares of the Company were to be
distributed  to  former Laptop Lane stockholders if certain performance goals or
other  criteria  were met.  At September 30, 2000, Laptop Lane achieved three of
the  four  performance  goals;  as  a result, 249,981 common stock shares of the
Company  and  cash amounting to $3,652,000 were distributed to the former Laptop
Lane stockholders.  In October 2000, Laptop Lane achieved the fourth performance
goal requirement, resulting in the distribution of 81,050 common stock shares of
the  Company  valued  at $332,000 to the former Laptop Lane stockholders.  These
common stock shares were issued in a nonpublic offering pursuant to transactions
exempt  under  Section  4(2)  of  the  Securities  Act.

As  of  September  30,  2002,  the  Company  has  granted stock options to seven
separate  consultants  to  purchase an aggregate of 180,500 common stock shares.
The  stock  options were granted as partial consideration for services rendered.
The  stock  options typically vest over the period of contracted service.  These
stock  options  have  an  exercise  price range from $7.375 to $23.8125.  In the
aggregate,  the  stock options have a weighted average exercise price of $13.08.
At  September  30, 2002, consultant stock options for 15,000 common stock shares
were  vested  and  outstanding.  For the year ended September 30, 2002, no stock
options were issued to consultants.  These stock options for common stock shares
were  granted  in  a  nonpublic  offering  pursuant to transactions exempt under
Section  4(2)  of  the  Securities  Act.

OVERVIEW

On July 30, 2002, SoftNet Systems, Inc., and subsidiaries (collectively referred
to  as  the  "Company")  entered  into  an  agreement  to acquire First Standard
Holdings  Corp.  from  SSH  Corp.  and  Independence Holding Company ("IHC") for
$31,920,000  in  cash.  Subsequently  at  the Special Meeting of Stockholders on
November  14,  2002,  the  Company's  stockholders  approved  the stock purchase
agreement between the Company, SSH Corp. and IHC (the "Purchase Agreement"), and
approved  the  Company's  name  change  to  American Independence Corp.  Also on
November  14, 2002, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase  Agreement  and  First  Standard  Holdings  Corp.  changed  its name to
Independence  American  Holdings  Corp.  ("IAHC").  IAHC  and  its  wholly-owned
subsidiaries  are  engaged  in  the  insurance  and  reinsurance  business.  The
Company,  which  was a holding company principally engaged in providing Internet
services,  had  previously  wound  down its Internet related businesses and as a
result  of  the  acquisition  of  IAHC  has become an insurance holding company.
Additionally,  due  to the acquisition of IAHC, the Company has decided to close
its  offices in San Francisco, terminate all but one of its employees, and enter
into  a services agreement with IHC under which the Company's operations will be
directed  by  IHC  management  and  employees.  The  transaction  is  more fully
described in the Company's Definitive Proxy/Prospectus Statement on Schedule 14A
as  filed  with  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission  on  September  30, 2002.

In  a  separate  transaction  on  July  30,  2002,  IHC acquired Pacific Century
Cyberworks  Limited's  ("PCCW")  entire  interest  in  the Company consisting of
5,000,000  common  stock  shares  at  $3.00  per  share  for  a  total  value of
$15,000,000.  As  a  result  of  this  transaction, PCCW's appointees Linus W.L.
Cheung and Jeffrey A. Bowden resigned from the Company's Board of Directors, and
Edward  Netter,  Chairman  of  IHC,  and  Roy  T.K.  Thung,  President and Chief
Executive  Officer  of  IHC, were appointed to the Company's Board of Directors.
Additionally,  upon  closing  of  the purchase of IAHC, IHC has agreed to make a
cash  tender  offer at $3.00 per share for at least 3,000,000 outstanding common
stock  shares  of  the  Company,  subject  to  certain  limitations.

On  May  17,  2002,  the  Company  received  a Nasdaq Staff Determination Letter
stating  that  the  Company's  common stock was no longer eligible for continued
listing  on  the  Nasdaq  National Market as a result of the Company ceasing the
operations  of  its  last  business  segment,  Intellicom,  and that the Company
therefore  did  not  meet  the  requirements  for continued listing set forth in
Marketplace  Rules  4300  and 4330.  Subsequently, the Company requested and was
granted  an  oral hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to appeal
the  Nasdaq  Staff  Determination  Letter,  which  stayed  the  delisting of the
Company's  common  stock  pending the outcome of the hearing.  On July 12, 2002,
the  Company  appeared before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to present
the Company's plan to acquire IAHC, which would allow the Company to comply with
the  Marketplace  Rules  4300  and 4330.  On August 15, 2002, the Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel informed the Company that the Company will remain listed on
Nasdaq,  subject  to meeting various conditions, including the completion of the
acquisition  of IAHC by December 31, 2002.  Nasdaq has also informed the Company
that  if it does remain listed on Nasdaq, following the acquisition of IAHC, the
Company  will  be required to meet Nasdaq's initial listing requirements as well
as  Nasdaq's  continued  listing  requirements.

As  of September 30, 2002, the Company had substantially completed the wind down
of  its  Internet  services  related  subsidiaries,  ISP  Channel,  Inc.  ("ISP
Channel"),  Intelligent  Communications,  Inc.  ("Intellicom"),  and  Aerzone
Corporation  ("Aerzone"),  including  Laptop  Lane Limited ("Laptop Lane"), as a
result  of  the  following:

On  December  7,  2000,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors approved a plan to
discontinue  its  ISP Channel operations because of (1) the consolidation in the
cable  industry  made  it  difficult for ISP Channel to achieve the economies of
scale  necessary to provide such services profitably, and (2) the Company was no
longer  able  to bear the costs of maintaining the ISP Channel.  Subsequently on
December  19,  2000,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  approved  a  plan to
discontinue  its  Aerzone,  including  Laptop  Lane, business in light of, among
other things, significant long-term capital needs and the difficulty of securing
the  necessary  financing because of the financial markets.  In conjunction with
discontinuing  the  ISP  Channel  and Aerzone businesses, the Company's Board of
Directors  on  December  28,  2000,  approved  a  plan  to  reduce its corporate
headquarters  staff.

On  March  29,  2002,  the  Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Intellicom,
entered  into  an agreement to sell its operating business and certain assets to
Loral  Cyberstar, Inc.  Following the sale of its operating business and certain
assets  to  Loral  Cyberstar, Inc., the Company's Board of Directors unanimously
agreed  to cease the operations of Intellicom on April 3, 2002.  Subsequently on
April  22,  2002, Intellicom entered into an agreement to sell certain assets to
Native  Intellicom,  Inc.,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Pinoleville Band of
Pomo Indians, for cash, subject to the termination of Intellicom's lease for its
facility in Livermore, California.  On August 1, 2002, Intellicom terminated the
agreement  with  the Pinoleville Band of Pomo Indians and is negotiating to sell
those  assets  to  another  group  of  Native  Americans.

The  Company  reports  operating expenses in several categories: (i) selling and
marketing;  (ii)  engineering; and (iii) general and administrative costs.  Also
included  in  operating  expenses  are  depreciation  and  non-cash compensation
expense  related  to  stock  options.  Non-cash  compensation expense related to
stock  options  relates  primarily  to  the  amortization  of  deferred  stock

CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES

The  preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America  requires  management  to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported  amounts  of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of  the revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could
differ  from  those  estimates.  The  Company  believes  the  following critical
accounting  policies  are  significantly  affected by judgments, assumptions and
estimates  used  in preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  For a
detailed  discussion  on the application of these and other accounting policies,
see  Note  2  to  the consolidated financial statements of the Company appearing
elsewhere  in  this  annual  report  on  Form  10-K.

Discontinued  Operations

The  Company  accounts  for  discontinued operations in accordance to Accounting
Principles  Board Opinion No. 30 ("APB 30"), Reporting the Results of Operations
- - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of Business, and Extraordinary,
Unusual  and  Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.  Under APB 30, the
Company  accrued  estimates  of  expected  liabilities  related  to discontinued
operations  through its eventual discharge.  The estimated remaining liabilities
related to discontinued operations include contract terminations, litigation and
loss  from operations subsequent to September 30, 2002.  The Company reviews the
estimated  closure  costs liability on a quarterly basis to determine changes in
the  costs  of  the  discontinued  operations  activities.

Restructuring  Expense

The  Company  recorded  restructuring  expenses  related  to an approved plan to
reduce  corporate  headquarters  staff  and to relocate its corporate offices in
conjunction  with  discontinuing  the  Aerzone,  ISP  Channel  and  Intellicom
businesses.  These restructuring expenses are based on estimates of the expected
costs  associated  with  employee  severance,  lease  terminations, and facility
relocation.  The  Company reviews the estimated restructuring costs accrual on a
quarterly  basis  to  determine  changes  in  the  costs  of  the  restructuring
activities.

Impairment  of  Long-lived  Assets

The  Company  evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever current events
or  changes  in  circumstances,  as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  No.  121  ("SFAS  121"),  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets  and  for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, indicate that the carrying
value  of  an  asset  may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash
flows  attributable  to that asset.  The amount of any impairment is measured as
the  difference  between  the  carrying value and the fair value of the impaired
asset.

Short-term  Investments

The  Company  accounts  for  its  short-term  investments  in  debt  and  equity
securities  under  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS
115"),  Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity Securities.
Short-term  investments  generally  consist  of  highly  liquid  securities with
original  maturities  in excess of three months.  The Company has classified its
short-term  investments  as  available-for-sale  securities.  These  short-term
investments  are  carried  at  fair  value  based  on  quoted market prices with
unrealized  gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss of
the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Realized  gains and losses on
short-term investments are computed using the specific identification method and
are  reported  in  miscellaneous  income  (expense),  net  of  the  accompanying
consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Declines  in  value  judged  to  be
other-than-temporary  is  determined based on the specific identification method
and  are  reported  in  loss  in  disposition  of  equity  investments  of  the
accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations.

LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES

Since September 1998, the Company has funded the significant negative cash flows
from its subsidiary operating activities and the associated capital expenditures
through  a  combination  of  public  and  private equity sales, convertible debt
issues and equipment leases.  At September 30, 2002, the Company had $62,059,000
in  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments compared with $75,454,000

$8,830,000  from  continuing  operations,  net  increase  in operating assets of
$848,000  and  a  net decrease in operating liabilities of $1,055,000, offset by

"Cash  Consideration");  (ii)  a  promissory  note  in  the amount of $1,000,000
bearing  interest  at  7.5% per annum and due one year after closing (the "First
Promissory  Note");  (iii) a promissory note in the amount of $2,000,000 bearing
interest  at  8.5%  per  annum  and  due  two  years  after closing (the "Second

common  stock  (adjustable  upwards  after  one  year in certain circumstances),
valued  at  $14.938  per  share,  for  a total value of $7,469,000 (the "Closing
Shares");  (v) additional shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon the
first,  second  and  third  anniversaries  of  the closing, valued at a total of
$3,500,000  (the  "Anniversary  Shares",  together  with  the Closing Shares are
defined  as  the  "Equity  Consideration");  and (vi) certain direct acquisition
costs  totaling  $400,000.  The  Debt  Consideration  may be partially or wholly
converted  into  the  Company's  common stock, under certain circumstances.  The
conversion  price  of  the Debt Consideration was based upon the average closing
price  of  the  Company's common stock for the 15 days immediately preceding the
conversion  date.

In  April  1999, the Company paid the First Promissory Note and related interest
in  full  with a combination $832,000 in cash and the remainder, after expenses,

paid  $1,000  for  fractional  shares to the former Intellicom stockholders.  On
February  7,  2001,  the  Company  made  an  offer  to  the  former  Intellicom
stockholders  to  pay a discounted amount in lieu of the Company's obligation to
pay  cash  and  stock  for  the remaining consideration, which was to be paid in
connection  with  the  Intellicom  acquisition and consisted of (i) a $2,000,000
8.5%  promissory note and accrued interest, (ii) the requirement for the Company
to issue $1,500,000 of common stock shares on the second anniversary date of the
Intellicom  acquisition,  and  (iii)  the  requirement  for the Company to issue
$500,000  of common stock shares on the third anniversary date of the Intellicom
acquisition.  The  parties  agreed to settle the obligation by which the Company
paid  $2,815,000  (including accrued interest of $325,000), issued 99,922 common
stock  shares valued at $199,000, and recognized a $1,326,000 extraordinary gain
on  settlements  of  outstanding  obligations.  On February 9, 2002, the Company
issued 12,426 common stock shares to settle the remaining obligations related to
the  requirement  to  issue common stock shares on the third anniversary date of
the  Intellicom  acquisition.


                                      -19-

Additionally,  the  Intellicom  Acquisition  agreement  included a demonstration
bonus  ("Demonstration  Bonus")  of  $1,000,000 payable in cash or shares of the
Company's  common stock at the Company's option by the first anniversary date of
the Intellicom Acquisition if certain conditions were met.  On February 8, 2000,
the  opportunity  to  earn the Demonstration Bonus had expired, and accordingly,
the  Demonstration  Bonus  was  not  paid  or  included in the purchase price of
Intellicom.

On  March  29,  2002,  the  Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Intellicom,
entered  into  an agreement to sell its operating business and certain assets to
Loral  Cyberstar, Inc.  Following the sale of its operating business and certain
assets  to  Loral  Cyberstar, Inc., the Company's Board of Directors unanimously
agreed  to cease the operations of Intellicom on April 3, 2002.  Subsequently on
April  22,  2002, Intellicom entered into an agreement to sell certain assets to
Native  Intellicom,  Inc.,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Pinoleville Band of
Pomo Indians, for cash, subject to the termination of Intellicom's lease for its
facility  in Livermore, California.  On August 1, 2002 Intellicom terminated the
agreement with the Pinoleville Band of Pomo Indians and is negotiating to a sell
those  assets  to  another  group of Native Americans.  The operating results of
Intellicom have been segregated from continuing operations and are reported as a
loss from discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.  Although  it is difficult to predict the final results, the loss on
disposition  from  discontinued  operations  includes  management's estimates of
costs  to  wind  down the business, costs to settle its outstanding liabilities,
and  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of assets.  The actual results could differ
materially  from these estimates.  The assets and liabilities of such operations
are  reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued operations of the
accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets at September 30, 2002 and 2001.  The
Company  recorded  an  estimated loss on disposition of Intellicom of $3,120,000
for  the  year  ended  September  30,  2002.  The  estimated loss on disposition
reserve  of  Intellicom  is  reflected  in  net  liabilities  associated  with
discontinued  operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets at
September  30,  2002,  and  the  corresponding  charge  is  reflected in loss on
disposition  of  discontinued  operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated
statements  of  operations  for  the  years  ended  September  30,  2002.

Formation of Aerzone, Acquisition of Laptop Lane, and Discontinued Operations of
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aerzone.  On  January  24,  2000,  the Company founded Aerzone (formerly SoftNet
- --------
Zone,  Inc.),  a  Delaware corporation, to provide high-speed Internet access to
global  business  travelers.  As  part  of  the  Aerzone  business,  the Company
acquired  Laptop  Lane,  a  Washington  corporation,  on  April  21,  2000.  The
acquisition  was  accounted  for  under  the purchase method, and the results of
Laptop  Lane  have  been included in the consolidated financial statements since
the  date  of acquisition.  Laptop Lane is a leading provider of business center
services  in airports.  The Company paid approximately $21,559,000 consisting of
(i)  972,266  common  stock  shares of the Company valued at $15,107,000, net of
adjustment  for expenses paid by the Company on behalf of Laptop Lane, exchanged
for  all outstanding common stock shares of Laptop Lane, (ii) direct acquisition
costs of approximately $2,300,000, which included a bonus payment to Laptop Lane
employees  of  $431,000  in lieu of Laptop Lane stock options, and (iii) 250,000
common  stock shares of the Company valued at $3,652,000 issued to former Laptop
Lane  stockholders  in  payment  for achieving certain criteria.  As part of the
acquisition, an additional 333,333 common stock shares of the Company were to be
distributed  to  former Laptop Lane stockholders if certain performance goals or
other  criteria  were met.  As of September 30, 2000, Laptop Lane achieved three
of  the  four performance goals; as a result, 249,981 common stock shares of the
Company  and  cash amounting to $3,652,000 were distributed to the former Laptop
Lane stockholders.  In October 2000, Laptop Lane achieved the fourth performance
goal requirement, resulting in the distribution of 81,050 common stock shares of
the  Company  valued  at  $332,000  to  the  former  Laptop  Lane  stockholders.
Additionally,  in  connection  with  the  acquisition,  the  Company  provided
$6,000,000  in  working capital to Laptop Lane, under a secured promissory note.

On December 19, 2000, the Company decided to discontinue the Aerzone business in
light  of significant long-term capital needs and the difficulty of securing the
necessary  financing because of the current state of the financial markets.  The
operating results of Aerzone have been segregated from continuing operations and
are  reported  as  loss  from  discontinued  operations  of  the  accompanying
consolidated  statement  of  operations.  The  loss from discontinued operations
includes management's estimates of the remaining costs to wind down the business
and  costs to settle its outstanding liabilities.  The assets and liabilities of
such  operations  are  reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued
operations of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2002
and  2001.  For  the  year  ended  September  30,  2000, the Company recorded an
estimated  loss  on disposition reserve of Aerzone of $42,200,000.  For the year
ended  September  30,  2001,  the  Company  increased  the  estimated  loss  on


                                      -20-
<PAGE>
disposition  reserve  of  Aerzone  by  $14,906,000, primarily as a result of the
Company  reducing  the  estimated  proceeds  from  the  sale  of Laptop Lane and
increasing estimated discontinued operating costs.  For the year ended September
30,  2002, the Company increased the estimated loss on disposition of Aerzone by
$750,000,  as  a  result  of  a  superior  court decision related to a breach of
contract  and other legal matters.  The estimated loss on disposition reserve of
Aerzone  is reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued operations
of  the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2002 and 2001,
and the corresponding charge is reflected in loss on disposition of discontinued
operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated statements of operations for the
years  ended  September  30,  2002,  2001  and  2000.

Discontinued  Operations  of  ISP  Channel.  On  December 7, 2000, the Company's
- -------------------------------------------
Board of Directors approved a plan to discontinue providing cable-based Internet
services through its ISP Channel subsidiary by December 31, 2000, because of (1)
consolidation in the cable television industry made it difficult for ISP Channel
to achieve the economies of scale necessary to provide such services profitably,
and  (2) the Company was no longer able to bear the costs of maintaining the ISP
Channel.  The  operating  results  of  ISP  Channel  have  been  segregated from
continuing  operations  and are reported as loss from discontinued operations of
the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  The  loss  from
discontinued  operations  includes management's estimates of the remaining costs
to  wind down the business, costs to settle its outstanding liabilities, and the
proceeds from the sale of assets.  The assets and liabilities of such operations
are  reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued operations of the
accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets at September 30, 2002 and 2001.  For
the  year  ended  September  30, 2000, the Company recorded an estimated loss on
disposition reserve of ISP Channel of $97,200,000.  For the year ended September
30, 2001, the Company decreased the estimated loss on disposition reserve of ISP
Channel by $10,008,000, primarily as a result of the Company experiencing better
than  previously  estimated  contract settlements.  For the year ended September
30,  2002,  the Company reduced the estimated loss on disposition reserve of ISP
Channel  by  $900,000,  primarily as a result of the Company experiencing better
than  previously  estimated  contract  settlements.  The  estimated  loss  on
disposition  reserve  of  ISP  Channel  is  reflected  in  net  liabilities  of
discontinued  operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets at
September  30,  2002  and  2001,  and  the  corresponding  benefit and charge is
reflected  in loss on disposition of discontinued operations of the accompanying
consolidated  statements  of  operations for the years ended September 30, 2002,
2001  and  2000.

Discontinued  Operations  of  Micrographic  Technology  Corporation  ("MTC")

As  a  result  of  a  preliminary arbitration decision related to a dispute with
Applications  Informatiques  Multimedia and a dispute related to the sale of MTC
to  Global  Information  Distribution  GmbH  ("GID"),  the  Company  recorded  a
$1,127,000  estimated  loss  on  disposition  reserve  of MTC for the year ended
September  30,  2002.  MTC  was previously owned by the Company, and was sold to
GID  on September 30, 1999.  The estimated loss on disposition reserve of MTC is
reflected  in  net  liabilities  associated  with discontinued operations of the
accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheet  at  September  30,  2002,  and  the
corresponding  charge  is  reflected  in  loss  on  disposition  of discontinued
operations of the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year
ended  September  30,  2002.

                FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS

The  risks  and  uncertainties  described  below  are not the only ones that the
Company  faces.  Additional  risks  and uncertainties not presently known to the
Company  or  that  the  Company  currently  deems immaterial may also impair the
Company's  business  operations.  If  any of the following risks actually occur,
the  Company's  business,  financial condition or results of operations could be
materially adversely affected.  In such case, the trading price of the Company's
common  stock  could  decline,  and you may lose all or part of your investment.

                                  COMPANY RISKS

IHC WILL EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND AFFAIRS,
WHICH  MAY RESULT IN POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN IHC AND THE COMPANY

The  Company's  operations  are  being directed by IHC management and employees,
which may result in potential conflicts of interest between IHC and the Company.
For  example, a conflict may arise if IHC were to engage in activities or pursue
corporate opportunities that overlap with the Company's business.  Because IHC's
management will also constitute the Company's management, these individuals will
have  fiduciary  duties  to  both  companies, which could result in conflicts of
interest,  including  the Company foregoing opportunities or taking actions that
disproportionately benefit IHC.  IHC will also have at least two representatives
on the Company's Board of Directors who will have similar conflicts of interest.
These  conflicts  could  harm  the  Company's  business.

THE  OCCURRENCE  OF VARIOUS EVENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO
UTILIZE  FULLY  ITS  TAX  NET  OPERATING  LOSS  CARRYFORWARDS

One  of  the  potential  benefits  of  the  Company's acquisition of IAHC is the
Company's  expectation  that  the  Company's U.S. federal tax net operating loss
carryforwards  of  approximately $264 million may be used against any subsequent
profits  from  IAHC's  business.  However,  events outside of the control of the
Company  or  IHC, such as certain acquisitions and dispositions of the Company's
common  stock,  may  limit  the use of all or a portion of the Company's tax net
operating  loss  carryforwards.  If  such  events  were  to occur, the Company's
expectation  of using its tax net operating loss carryforwards against potential
IAHC  profits  would  not  be  realized and the Company could potentially have a
higher  tax  liability  in  the  future  than  it  would  otherwise  have  had.

AS  A  RESULT  OF THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF IAHC, THE COMPANY WILL OPERATE IN
THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRY, AN INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NOT
PREVIOUSLY  OPERATED

The  Company  has  not  previously  operated  in  the  insurance and reinsurance
industry.  As  such, the Company is faced with risks that are new to the Company
and  which  may  adversely  affect the Company.  The Company is relying upon the
management  and  expertise  of officers of IHC who will serve as officers of the
Company  post-closing.  The  Company  cannot  assure you of the effect this will
have  on  the  Company's  future  operating results or stock price.  These risks
include  the  following:

     IAHC's Results May Fluctuate as a Result of Factors Generally Affecting the
     Insurance  and  Reinsurance  Industry

     The  results  of  companies  in  the  insurance  and  reinsurance  industry
     historically  have  been  subject  to  significant  fluctuations  and
     uncertainties. Factors that affect the industry in general could also cause
     IAHC's  results to fluctuate. The industry's and IAHC's financial condition
     and  results  of  operations  may  be  affected  significantly  by:

          -    Fluctuations  in interest rates, inflationary pressures and other
               changes  in  the  investment environment, which affect returns on
               invested  capital  and  may  impact  the  ultimate payout of loss
               amounts;
          -    Rising  levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at
               the  time  they  price  their  products;
          -    Events  like  the  September l1, 2001 attacks, which affected the
               insurance  and  reinsurance  markets  generally;
          -    Changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that
               may  arise  and  the  development  of  judicial  interpretations
               relating  to  the  scope  of  insurers'  liability;  and
          -    The  overall  level  of  economic  activity  and  the competitive
               environment  in  the  industry.

     Decrease  in  Rates for Accident and Health Reinsurance and Insurance Could
     Reduce  IAHC's  Net  Income

     IAHC  primarily writes accident and health insurance and reinsurance. Rates
     for  accident and health insurance and reinsurance are influenced primarily
     by  factors  that  are outside of IAHC's control and historically have been
     highly  cyclical.  Any  significant  decrease in the rates for accident and
     health  insurance  or  reinsurance  could  reduce  IAHC's  net  income.

     If  the  Rating Agencies Downgrade IAHC's Insurance Company, IAHC's Results
     of  Operations  and  Competitive  Position  in  the  Industry  May  Suffer

     Ratings  have  become  an increasingly important factor in establishing the
     competitive  position  of  insurance companies. IAHC's insurance subsidiary
     Independence  American Insurance Company ("Independence American") is rated
     B+  (Very  Good)  by  A.M.  Best  Company,  Inc., whose ratings reflect its
     opinions  of  an  insurance  company's  financial  strength,  operating
     performance,  strategic  position,  and  ability to meet its obligations to
     policyholders, and are not evaluations directed to investors. The rating of
     Independence  American  is subject to periodic review by A.M. Best Company,
     Inc., and IAHC cannot assure you of the continued retention of this rating.
     If A.M. Best Company, Inc. reduces Independence American's ratings from its
     current  levels,  IAHC's  business  would  be  adversely  affected.

     IAHC's  Loss Reserves are Based on an Estimate of Its Future Liability, and
     if  Actual  Claims Prove to be Greater Than IAHC's Reserves, Its Results of
     Operations  and  Financial  Condition  May  Be  Adversely  Affected

     IAHC maintains loss reserves to cover IAHC's estimated liability for unpaid
     losses and loss adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees as well
     as a portion of IAHC's general expenses, for reported and unreported claims
     incurred  as of the end of each accounting period. Because setting reserves
     is  inherently uncertain, IAHC cannot assure you that current reserves will
     prove  adequate  in  light  of  subsequent  events.  If IAHC's reserves are
     insufficient  to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, IAHC
     would  have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings, and
     these  charges  could  be  material.  Reserves  do  not  represent an exact
     calculation  of  liability.  Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what
     IAHC  expects  the  ultimate  settlement  and administration of claims will
     cost.  These  estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are
     based  on  IAHC's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well
     as  estimates  of  future  trends  in  claims severity, frequency, judicial
     theories  of  liability  and other factors. These variables are affected by
     both  internal  and  external  events,  such  as changes in claims handling
     procedures,  inflation,  judicial  trends  and legislative changes. Many of
     these  items  are not directly quantifiable in advance. Additionally, there
     may  be  a  significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured
     event  and  the  time it is reported to IAHC. The inherent uncertainties of
     estimating  reserves  are  greater  for  certain  types  of  liabilities,
     particularly  those  in which the various considerations affecting the type
     of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse
     before  a  definitive determination of liability is made. Reserve estimates
     are  continually  refined  in  a  regular and ongoing process as experience
     develops  and  further  claims  are  reported  and  settled. Adjustments to
     reserves  are  reflected  in  the  results  of  the  periods  in which such
     estimates  are  changed.

     IAHC's  Inability  to  Assess Underwriting Risk Accurately Could Reduce Its
     Net  Income

     IAHC's  success  is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks
     associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained. If IAHC fails
     to  assess  accurately the risks it retains, IAHC may fail to establish the
     appropriate  premium  rates  and IAHC's reserves may be inadequate to cover
     its  losses, requiring augmentation of IAHC's reserves, which in turn could
     reduce  IAHC's  net  income.

     If  IAHC  is  Unsuccessful  in  Competing  Against  Larger  or  More
     Well-Established  Competitors,  IAHC's  Results of Operations and Financial
     Condition  Will  Be  Adversely  Affected

     IAHC's  industry  is  highly  competitive  and has experienced severe price
     competition  from  time  to  time  over  the last several years. IAHC faces
     competition  from  domestic  and  international  insurance  and reinsurance
     companies,  underwriting  agencies, and from diversified financial services
     companies  that  are  significantly  larger  than  IAHC.  Some  of  these
     competitors  have  greater  financial,  marketing  and other resources than
     IAHC,  have  been operating longer than IAHC and have established long-term
     and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be
     a  significant  competitive  advantage.  In  addition to competition in the
     operation  of  IAHC's  business,  IAHC  faces competition from a variety of
     sources in attracting and retaining qualified employees. IAHC cannot assure
     you  that  it will maintain its current competitive position in the markets
     in which it operates, or that it will be able to expand its operations into
     new  markets and compete effectively in the future. If IAHC fails to do so,
     its  business  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.


                                      -23-
<PAGE>
     If  IAHC Fails to Comply With Extensive State and Federal Regulations, IAHC
     Will  Be  Subject  to Penalties, Which May Include Fines and Suspension and
     Which  May  Adversely  Affect  IAHC's  Results  of Operations and Financial
     Condition.

     IAHC  is subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision. Most
     insurance  regulations  are  designed  to  protect  the  interests  of
     policyholders  rather  than  stockholders  and  other  investors.  This
     regulation,  generally  administered  by  a department of insurance in each
     state  in  which  IAHC  does  business,  relates  to,  among  other things:

          -    Approval  of  policy  forms  and  premium  rates;
          -    Standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements,
               which  are  a  measure  developed  by the National Association of
               Insurance Commissioners and used by state insurance regulators to
               identify  insurance  companies  that potentially are inadequately
               capitalized;
          -    Licensing  of  insurers  and  their  agents;
          -    Restrictions  on  the  nature,  quality  and  concentration  of
               investments;
          -    Restrictions  on the ability of Independence American's insurance
               company  to  pay  dividends  to  IAHC;
          -    Restrictions  on  transactions  between  insurance  companies and
               their  affiliates;
          -    Restrictions  on  the  size  of  risks  insurable  under a single
               policy;
          -    Requiring  deposits  for  the  benefit  of  policyholders;
          -    Requiring  certain  methods  of  accounting;
          -    Periodic  examinations  of Independence American's operations and
               finances;
          -    Prescribing  the  form  and  content  of  records  of  financial
               condition  required  to  be  filed;  and
          -    Requiring  reserves  for  unearned  premium,  losses  and  other
               purposes.

     State  insurance  departments  also  conduct  periodic  examinations of the
     affairs  of  insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other
     reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding
     company  issues  and  other  matters.

     Recently  adopted  federal  financial services modernization legislation is
     expected to lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry
     in  the coming years. IAHC's business depends on compliance with applicable
     laws  and  regulations  and  its  ability  to  maintain  valid licenses and
     approvals  for its operations. Regulatory authorities have broad discretion
     to  grant,  renew, or revoke licenses and approvals. Regulatory authorities
     may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of
     regulations.  In  some  instances,  IAHC  follows  practices  based  on its
     interpretations  of  regulations, or those that it believes to be generally
     followed  by  the industry, which may be different from the requirements or
     interpretations  of  regulatory  authorities.  If  IAHC  does  not have the
     requisite  licenses  and  approvals  and  does  not  comply with applicable
     regulatory  requirements,  the  insurance  regulatory  authorities  could
     preclude  or  temporarily  suspend IAHC from carrying on some or all of its
     activities  or  otherwise  penalize  it.  That  type of action could have a
     material  adverse  effect on IAHC's business. Also, changes in the level of
     regulation  of  the insurance industry (whether federal, state or foreign),
     or  changes  in  laws  or  regulations  themselves  or  interpretations  by
     regulatory  authorities,  could  have  a  material adverse effect on IAHC's
     business.

     Certain  Proposed  Federal and State Legislation May, if Adopted, Adversely
     Affect  IAHC's  Reinsurance  of  Medical  Stop-Loss.

     Individuals  who  obtain  health coverage through self-insured plans cannot
     currently  sue  their  employer in state court for punitive or compensatory
     damages, but can seek legal recourse in federal court where an employer can
     be  ordered  to cover a wrongfully-denied benefit. In the continuing debate
     over  health  care  reform,  certain federal and state legislation has been
     proposed  which  could  have  the  effect  of  making  plan  sponsors,
     administrators,  or  certain  other  parties liable for punitive damages in
     state  court. While IAHC cannot predict whether any of these proposals will
     be  adopted or what, if any, impact enactment of any of these would have on
     its  reinsurance  of  medical  stop-loss,  the number of employers offering
     health  benefits  or  choosing  self-insured  plans could be reduced, plans
     could  increase  the  portion  paid  by  employees  (thereby  reducing
     participation),  pricing  and  coverage  options  could  be  affected,  and
     Independence  American  could  be  faced  with greater liability exposures,
     although this would be somewhat mitigated since Independence American would
     not  be  the  issuing  carrier.

     At  September  30,  2002,  $5,463,000  of  IAHC's  $11,203,000  investment
     portfolio was invested in fixed income securities. The fair market value of
     these  fixed  income  securities and the investment income from these fixed
     income  securities  fluctuate  depending  on  general  economic  and market
     conditions.  With respect to IAHC's investments in fixed income securities,
     the fair market value of these investments generally increases or decreases
     in  an  inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net
     investment  income realized by IAHC from future investments in fixed income
     securities  will  generally  increase  or  decrease with interest rates. In
     addition,  actual  net investment income and/or cash flows from investments
     that  carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed
     securities,  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as
     a  result  of interest rate fluctuations. An investment has prepayment risk
     when  there  is  a  risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the
     repayment  of  principal  might  occur  earlier than anticipated because of
     declining  interest  rates  or  later  than  anticipated  because of rising
     interest  rates.  Historically,  the  impact  of  market  fluctuations  has
     affected  IAHC's  financial  statements. Because all of IAHC's fixed income
     securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the fair market
     value  of  IAHC's  securities  are  reflected in IAHC's other comprehensive
     income.  Similar  treatment  is  not  available for liabilities. Therefore,
     interest  rate  fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect
     IAHC's  stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows.

     Regulatory  Restrictions  Limit  IAHC's  Ability  to  Obtain Dividends from
     Independence  American

     One  of  IAHC's  principal  assets  is  the  shares  of  capital  stock  of
     Independence  American.  IAHC  may  rely  on  dividends  from  Independence
     American  to  meet  its  obligations  for  paying principal and interest on
     outstanding  debt  obligations,  dividends  to  stockholders  and corporate
     expenses.  The  payment of dividends by Independence American is subject to
     regulatory  restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings
     of  Independence  American,  as  well  as the regulatory restrictions. As a
     result,  should  IAHC's other sources of funds prove to be inadequate, IAHC
     may  not  be  able to receive dividends from Independence American at times
     and  in  amounts  necessary  to  meet  its  obligations.

     IAHC  is  Dependent  on  Key  Personnel

     IAHC's  success has been, and will continue to be, dependent on its ability
     to retain the services of its existing key executive officers, who are also
     executive  officers  of IHC, and to attract and retain additional qualified
     personnel  in  the  future.  The  loss  of  the  services of any of its key
     executive  officers  or  the  inability  to  hire  and  retain other highly
     qualified  personnel in the future could adversely affect IAHC's ability to
     conduct  its  business.

     New  Laws  and  Regulations  Addressing  Privacy and Electronic Transaction
     Issues  Create  Uncertainty  and  Risk  for  Insurers

     In  recent  years, the United States Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
     Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. These acts
     afford  protection  for  "nonpublic  personal  information"  relating  to
     consumers,  and  require  certain  transactions  to  be  conducted  on  an
     electronic  basis. Federal regulators have implemented several requirements
     of these acts. Additionally, virtually all state legislatures or regulatory
     bodies  have  adopted,  or are considering the adoption of, additional laws
     and regulations to address privacy and electronic transaction issues. These
     new  laws  create  uncertainty  and  risks  for  insurers,  which  need  to
     accurately  describe  their  privacy  practices  and  develop  appropriate
     procedures  to manage, protect and transmit certain types of customer data.
     While IAHC has implemented a process to monitor and achieve compliance with
     these  laws,  the  associated costs and potential risks and liabilities are
     difficult  or impossible to quantify. IAHC is unable to predict the precise
     nature and content of future laws and regulations, or the effects that they
     may  have  on  the  business,  operations,  operating  results or financial
     condition  of  IAHC.  Potential  areas of exposure facing the industry as a
     whole  include  failure  to  accurately  or  adequately  describe  privacy
     practices  or to protect customer information from unauthorized disclosure.

THE  COMPANY'S  ACQUISITION OF IAHC MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL
CONDITION

The  acquisition  of  IAHC  may have potential negative effects on the Company's
reported results of operations from acquisition-related charges and amortization
of  other  intangible  assets.  As a result of the IAHC acquisition, the Company
may  record  additional  intangible  assets,  which  may  adversely  affect  the
Company's  earnings and profitability for the foreseeable future.  If the amount


                                      -25-
<PAGE>
of  such  recorded  intangible  assets is increased or if the Company has future
losses  and is unable to demonstrate the Company's ability to recover the amount
of intangible assets recorded during such time periods, the intangible asset can
be  written  down  or  the  period of amortization could be shortened, which may
further  increase  annual  amortization  charges.  In  such event, the Company's
business  and  financial  condition  could  be  materially  adversely  affected.

IF  THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS INTO
THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS, THEN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY
BE  ADVERSELY  AFFECTED

Following its acquisition of IAHC, the Company expects to acquire other managing
general  underwriter  businesses.  The  Company  cannot  predict  if or when any
prospective  acquisitions  will  occur  or  the  likelihood  that  they  will be
completed  on  favorable  terms.  Acquiring  a  business  involves  many  risks,
including:

     -    Diversion  of  resources  and  management  time;
     -    Dilution  to  existing  stockholders  if  the  Company  uses  equity
          securities  to  finance  acquisitions;
     -    Incurrence  of  unforeseen  obligations  or  liabilities;
     -    Inability  of  management  to  maintain  uniform  standards, controls,
          procedures  and  policies;
     -    Difficulty  assimilating  the  acquired  operations  and  personnel;
     -    Risks of entering markets in which the Company has little or no direct
          prior  experience;  and
     -    Impairment  of  relationships with employees as a result of changes in
          management.

The Company cannot assure you that it will make any acquisitions or that it will
be  able to obtain additional financing for such acquisitions, if necessary.  If
any acquisitions are made, the Company cannot assure you that it will be able to
successfully  integrate  the  acquired  business into its operations or that the
acquired  business  will  perform  as  expected.

THE  COMPANY'S  EQUITY  INVESTMENTS IN OTHER COMPANIES MAY NOT YIELD ANY RETURNS

Although  the  Company  does  not intend to do so in the future, the Company has
made equity investments in Internet-related companies.  In most instances, these
investments  are  in  the  form of unregistered securities of private companies.
These  companies  typically  are  in  an  early  stage of development and may be
expected  to  incur  substantial  losses.  The  Company's  investments  in these
companies  may  not  yield any returns.  Furthermore, if these companies are not
successful,  the  Company  could  incur  and has incurred charges related to the
write-down  or  write-off  of these investments.  For example, the Company wrote
down  equity investments by $733,000 for the year ended September 30, 2002.  The
Company  also records and continues to record a share of the net losses in these
companies, up to its cost basis.  The Company may make additional investments in
the  future.  Losses  or charges resulting from these investments could harm the
Company's  operating  results.

THE  COMPANY'S  STOCK  PRICE  IS  VOLATILE

The volatility of the Company's stock price may make it difficult for holders of
the  common  stock to transfer their shares at the prices they want.  The market
price  for the Company's common stock has been volatile in the past, and several
factors  could  cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future.  These
factors  include:

     -    Announcements  of  developments  related  to  the  Company's business;
     -    Fluctuations  in  the  Company's  results  of  operations;
     -    Sales  of  substantial  amounts  of  the  Company's  securities in the
          marketplace;
     -    General  conditions  in  the  Company's  industries  or  the worldwide
          economy;
     -    An  outbreak  of  war  or  hostilities;
     -    A shortfall in earnings compared to securities analysts' expectations;
     -    Changes  in  analysts'  recommendations  or  projections;  and
     -    Changes  in  the Company's relationships with the Company's suppliers.

The  market  price  of the Company's common stock may fluctuate significantly in
the  future,  and  these  fluctuations  may  be  unrelated  to  the  Company's
performance.  General  market  price declines or market volatility in the future
could  adversely  affect  the price of the Company's common stock, and thus, the
current  market  price  may  not  be  indicative  of  future  market  prices.

PROSPECTIVE  ANTI-TAKEOVER  PROVISIONS  COULD  NEGATIVELY  IMPACT  THE COMPANY'S
STOCKHOLDERS

The  Company  is  a  Delaware  corporation. The Delaware General Corporation Law
contains  certain provisions that may discourage or delay a change in control of
the  Company,  make a change in control of the Company more difficult or prevent
the  removal  of  incumbent directors. In addition, the Company's certificate of
incorporation  and  bylaws  contain  certain  provisions that have the same or a
similar  effect. These provisions may have a negative impact on the price of the
Company's  common stock and may discourage third-party bidders from making a bid
for the Company or may reduce any premiums paid to stockholders for their common
stock.

THE  COMPANY  HAS  A  HISTORY  OF  LOSSES AND MAY FACE UNEXPECTED LIABILITIES IN
WINDING  DOWN  THE  BUSINESSES  OF  INTELLICOM,  ISP  CHANNEL  AND  AERZONE

The  Company  has  sustained substantial losses over the last five fiscal years.
For  the  year  ended  September  30,  2002,  the  Company  had  a  net  loss of
$14,756,000.  At  September  30, 2002, the Company had an accumulated deficit of
$405,003,000.  While  the Company expects the process of winding down Intellicom
to  be  substantially  completed by December 31, 2002, the Company cannot assure
you  that  it  will  be able to do so.  The Company expects to incur significant
costs  related  to  terminating contracts, reducing the workforce and recovering
and  disposing  of  deployed  assets.  While  the  businesses  of  ISP  Channel,
Intellicom,  and  Aerzone  have  been substantially wound down, the Company also
cannot  assure  you that all claims and issues have been resolved.  In addition,
the  Company  is  currently  involved  in  litigation,  and may in the future be
involved  in  additional  litigation,  with respect to the winding down of these
former  businesses.  The  Company  cannot  assure you of the outcome of any such
litigation.

ITEM  7A.  QUANTITATIVE  AND  QUALITATIVE  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT  MARKET  RISK

INTEREST  RATE  RISK

The  Company's  exposure  to  market  risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily  to  the  increase  or  decrease  in the amount of interest income the
Company can earn on its investment portfolio, and on the increase or decrease in
the  amount of interest expense the Company must pay with respect to its various
outstanding  debt  instruments.  The  risk  associated with fluctuating interest
expense  is  limited, however, to the exposure related to those debt instruments
and credit facilities, which are tied to market rates.  The Company does not use
derivative  financial  instruments  or  engage  in  hedging  activities  in  its
investment  portfolio.  The  Company  ensures the safety and preservation of its
invested principal funds by limiting default risks, market risk and reinvestment
risk.  The  Company  mitigates default risk by investing in safe and high-credit
quality  securities.

The  Company  had  short-term  investments of $40,910,000 at September 30, 2002.
Except  for  investments  in  common  and  preferred  stock,  these  short-term
investments consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the
date  of  purchase  of between three and twenty-three months.  These investments
are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk and will fall in value if market interest
rates increase.  The Company believes a hypothetical increase in market interest
rates  by  10%  from levels at September 30, 2002, would cause the fair value of
these short-term investments to fall by an immaterial amount.  Since the Company
is not required to sell these investments before maturity, it has the ability to
avoid  realizing  losses  on  these investments due to a sudden change in market
interest  rates.  On  the  other  hand, declines in the interest rates over time
will  reduce  its  interest  income.

Interest rate increases, however, will increase interest expense associated with
future  borrowing  by  the  Company, if any.  The Company does not hedge against
interest  rate  fluctuations.

CURRENCY  EXCHANGE  RISK

The  Company  has  historically  had  very  low  exposure  to changes in foreign
currency  exchange  rates,  and  as  such,  has  not  used  derivative financial
instruments  to  manage  foreign  currency  fluctuation  risk.

RECENT  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS

In  April  2002,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued
Statement  of  Financial Accounting No. 145 ("SFAS 145"), Rescission of SFAS No.
4,  44,  and  64,  Amendment  of  SFAS  No. 13, and Technical Corrections.  This
statement  rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting No. 4, Reporting Gains and
Losses  from  Extinguishment  of Debt, Statement of Financial Accounting No. 64,
Extinguishment  of Debt made to satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements, and Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  No.  44,  Accounting  for  Intangible Assets of Motor
Carriers.  This  statement also amends Statement of Financial Accounting No. 13,
Accounting  for Leases, to eliminate an inconsistency between the accounting for
sale-leaseback  transactions  and the accounting for certain lease modifications
that  have  economic  effects  that  are similar to sale-leaseback transactions.
SFAS  145  is  effective  for fiscal years beginning after, transactions entered
into  after  and  financial  statements issued on or subsequent to May 15, 2002.
The  adoption  of SFAS 145 had no impact on financial statements of the Company.

In  June  2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting No. 146 ("SFAS
146"),  Accounting  for  Exit  or  Disposal  Activities.  SFAS 146 addresses the
recognition,  measurement,  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit
and  disposal activities, including costs related to terminating a contract that
is  not  a  capital  lease  and  termination  benefits  that  employees  who are
involuntarily  terminated  receive  under  the  terms  of  a  one-time  benefit
arrangement  that  is  not  an  ongoing  benefit  arrangement  or  an individual
deferred-compensation  contract.  SFAS 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue  No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits
and  Other  Costs  to  Exit  an  Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring),  and  requires  liabilities  associated  with  exit and disposal
activities  to  be  expensed  as  incurred.  SFAS  146  is effective for exit or
disposal  activities  that  we  initiate  after  December  31,  2002.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



The Board of Directors and Stockholders
American Independence Corp. (formerly SoftNet Systems, Inc.):

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of American
Independence  Corp.  (formerly  SoftNet  Systems,  Inc.)  and Subsidiaries as of
September  30,  2002  and  2001,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements of
operations,  stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the years
in  the  three-year  period  ended  September  30, 2002.  In connection with our
audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  we  have also audited the
financial  statement  schedule  as  listed  in  the  index  appearing under Item
15(a)(2).  These  consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial  statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements and
financial  statement  schedule  based  on  our  audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in  the  United  States  of  America.  Those  standards require that we plan and
perform  the  audit  to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable  basis  for  our  opinion.

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position of
American Independence Corp. (formerly SoftNet Systems, Inc.) and Subsidiaries as
of  September  30,  2002  and 2001, and the results of their operations and cash
flows  for  each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2002,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of  America.  Also,  in  our  opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when  considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole,  presents  fairly,  in  all  material respects, the information set forth
therein.

                  AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   NATURE OF BUSINESS

     American  Independence  Corp.  ("AIC"), formerly SoftNet Systems, Inc., and
     subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the ''Company'') was previously a
     holding  company  principally  engaged in providing Internet services. As a
     result  of  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors'  decisions,  the  Company
     discontinued  the  businesses  of  ISP  Channel,  Inc.  ("ISP  Channel"),
     Intelligent  Communications,  Inc.  ("Intellicom")  and Aerzone Corporation
     ("Aerzone"), including Laptop Lane Limited ("Laptop Lane"), and reduced its
     corporate  headquarters  staff.  As of September 30, 2002, the wind down of
     ISP  Channel,  Intellicom  and  Aerzone,  including  Laptop  Lane,  were
     substantially  complete.  Upon the closing of the transactions contemplated
     by  the  Company's  agreement  dated July 30, 2002, to acquire Independence
     American  Holdings  Corporation  ("IAHC")  from  SSH Corp. and Independence
     Holding  Company  ("IHC")  for  $31,920,000  in  cash,  AIC  will become an
     insurance  holding  company.  Four  previously  reported business segments,
     business  center  services,  satellite-based Internet services, cable-based
     Internet  services  and document management, have ceased operations or have
     been  sold,  and  accordingly  are reported as discontinued operations (see
     Note  3).

2.   SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES

     Principles  of  Consolidation

     The  consolidated  financial statements include the accounts of AIC and its
     wholly  owned  subsidiaries.  All  significant  intercompany  balances  and
     transactions  have  been  eliminated  in  consolidation.

     Restatements  and  Reclassifications

     The consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated
     financial statements have been restated for the effects of the discontinued
     operations  of Intellicom (see Note 3). Certain reclassifications have been
     made  to prior years' consolidated financial statements in order to conform
     to  the  current  year  presentation.

     Use  of  Estimates  and  Assumptions

     The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial statements in conformity with
     generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make
     estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and
     liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
     of  the  financial  statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and
     expenses  during  the  reporting  period.  Actual results could differ from
     those  estimates.

     Segment  Information

     The  Company  adopted  Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131
     ("SFAS  131"),  Disclosures  about  Segments  of  an Enterprise and Related
     Information.  SFAS  131  establishes  standards  for  companies  to  report
     information  about  its operating segments on the same basis a company uses
     internally  for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate
     resources  to  segments.  As a result of the April 3, 2002, decision by the
     Company's  Board  of  Directors  to cease the operations of Intellicom, the
     Company  discontinued  its  last  business segment. Accordingly, no segment
     information  is  disclosed  in the accompanying notes to these consolidated
     financial  statements.

     Comprehensive  Income

     The  Company  adopted  Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130
     ("SFAS  130"),  Reporting  Comprehensive  Income.  SFAS  130  establishes
     standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income (loss), and its
     components  in  the consolidated financial statements. Comprehensive income
     (loss)  is  defined  by  Statement  of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6,
     Elements  of  Financial  Statements,  as the change in equity of a business
     enterprise  during  a  period  from  transactions  and  other  events  and
     circumstances  from  nonowner  sources.  As  required  by  SFAS  130,  all
     transactions,  including  foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  and
     unrealized  losses  on  investments,  are  included  in  accumulated  other
     comprehensive  loss  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of
     stockholders'  equity  (deficit)  and  consolidated  balance  sheets.

     Impairment  of  Long-lived  Assets

     The  Company  evaluates  long-lived  assets for impairment whenever current
     events  or  changes  in circumstances, as defined in Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standards No. 121 ("SFAS 121"), Accounting for the Impairment of


                                      -35-
<PAGE>
     Long-Lived  Assets  and  for  Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, indicate
     that  the  carrying  value  of  an  asset  may  not be recoverable based on
     expected  undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset. The amount of
     any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and
     the  fair  value  of  the  impaired  asset.

     Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments

     The  carrying  amount of the Company's financial instruments, which include
     cash  and  cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments,  trade receivables,
     accounts  payable,  accrued  liabilities  and  long-term debt, approximates
     their  fair  values.

     Concentration  of  Credit  Risk

     Financial  instruments  that  potentially  subject  the  Company  to
     concentrations  of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables, cash
     and  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term investments. The Company's account
     receivable is comprised of one customer at September 30, 2002 and 2001, and
     was $2,092,000 and $3,584,000, respectively. The Company does not invest in
     derivative  instruments  or  engage  in  hedging  activities.

     Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed by recognized
     financial  institutions, which follow the Company's investment policy. Such
     investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure in any one issue and
     the  maturity  date  of  the  investment securities that typically comprise
     investment  grade  short-term  debt  instruments.

     Cash,  Cash  Equivalents  and  Restricted  Cash

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid securities with
     maturities  of  three months or less from date of purchase. Restricted cash
     consists  of  time  deposit  pledged  as  collateral  on a letter of credit
     relating  to  a  certain  operating  lease.

     Short-term  Investments

     The  Company  accounts  for  its  short-term investments in debt and equity
     securities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS
     115"),  Accounting  for  Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.
     Short-term  investments  generally consist of highly liquid securities with
     original  maturities  in excess of three months. The Company has classified
     its  short-term  investments  as  available-for-sale  securities.  These
     short-term  investments  are  carried  at fair value based on quoted market
     prices  with  unrealized  gains  and  losses  reported in accumulated other
     comprehensive  loss  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets.
     Realized  gains and losses on short-term investments are computed using the
     specific  identification  method  and  are reported in miscellaneous income
     (expense),  net  of the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
     Declines  in value judged to be other-than-temporary is determined based on
     the  specific  identification  method  and  are  reported  in provision for
     impaired  assets  of the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

     Property  and  Equipment

     Property  and  equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recorded at
     cost.  When property and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the
     cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
     the  resulting  gain or loss is included in miscellaneous income (expense),
     net of the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Depreciation
     is  computed  on  a  straight-line  basis over the shorter of the estimated
     useful  lives  of  between  three  to seven years or the life of the lease.

     Internal  Use  Software  Costs

     The  Company  capitalizes  the  costs  of  computer  software  developed or
     obtained for internal use in accordance with Statement of Position No. 98-1
     ("SOP  98-1"),  Accounting  for  Costs  of  Computer  Software Developed or
     Obtained  for  Internal Use. Capitalized computer software costs consist of
     purchased  software licenses and implementation costs. Costs capitalized at
     September  30,  2001, of $446,000 are included in other equipment (see Note
     7).  These  capitalized  software  costs  are  being  depreciated  on  a
     straight-line basis over five years. In March 2002, the Company migrated to
     an  off-the-shelf  accounting  software,  and  accordingly  wrote  off  the
     remaining capitalized accounting software costs net book value of $352,000,
     which  is included in the provision for impaired assets in the accompanying
     consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2002.
     Depreciation  expense was $42,000 and $52,000 for the years ended September
     30,  2002  and 2001, respectively. No depreciation expense for internal use
     software  was  charged  for  the  year  ended  September  30,  2000.


                                      -36-
<PAGE>
     Income  Taxes

     The  Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method
     in  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 109
     ("SFAS  109"),  Accounting  for  Income  Taxes.  Deferred  tax  assets  and
     liabilities  are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
     differences  between  the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and
     liabilities  and  their  respective  tax  bases, and operating loss and tax
     credit  carryforwards.  Deferred  tax  assets  and liabilities are measured
     using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
     which  those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
     The  effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
     is  recognized  in  income  in the period that includes the enactment date.
     Valuation  allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
     assets  where  it  is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will
     not  be  realized  (see  Note  16).

     Stock-Based  Compensation

     The  Company  accounts  for  employee  stock-based  compensation  using the
     intrinsic  value  method,  as  prescribed  by  Accounting  Principles Board
     Opinion  No.  25  ("APB  25"), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. As
     such,  deferred  compensation is recorded only if the exercise price of the
     stock  option  is  below  the  current market price of the Company's common
     stock  on  the  date  of  grant. Deferred compensation expense for employee
     stock  options  is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term
     of  the  stock  option,  which  typically  is  four  years.

     The  Company  accounts  for non-employee stock-based compensation using the
     fair  value  method,  as  required  by  Statement  of  Financial Accounting
     Standard  No. 123 ("SFAS 123"), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. As
     such,  deferred compensation is recorded for all non-employee stock options
     as  of  the  date  of grant. Deferred compensation expense for non-employee
     stock  options  is  amortized  on  an  accelerated  basis, as prescribed by
     Financial  Interpretation  No.  28  ("FIN  28"),  Accounting  for  Stock
     Appreciation  Rights  and  Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, over
     the  contractual  life  of  the  stock  option.

     Earnings  (Loss)  Per  Common  Share

     The  Company calculates earnings (loss) per common share in accordance with
     Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standard No. 128 ("SFAS 128"), Earnings
     Per  Share.  SFAS 128 requires the presentation of basic earnings per share
     and  diluted  earnings  per  share  for companies with potentially dilutive
     securities,  such  as  stock warrants and stock options. Accordingly, basic
     earnings  (loss)  per  common  share is computed using the weighted average
     number  of  common  stock  shares  outstanding  during  the period. Diluted
     earnings  (loss)  per  common  share is computed using the weighted average
     number  of  common  stock  shares  and  common  stock  equivalent  shares
     outstanding  during  the  period.  Common  stock  equivalents  consist  of
     convertible  preferred  stock  (using  the "as if converted" method), stock
     options  and  stock  warrants  (using  the "treasury stock" method). Common
     stock  equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if the effect is
     antidilutive.  As  a  result  of  the  antidilutive  effect,  common  stock
     equivalent  shares  have  been  excluded  from  the  computation of diluted
     earnings  per  share  for  all  periods  presented.

     Recent  Accounting  Pronouncements

     In  April  2002,  the  Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
     Statement  of Financial Accounting No. 145 ("SFAS 145"), Rescission of SFAS
     No.  4,  44,  and  64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical Corrections.
     This  statement rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting No. 4, Reporting
     Gains  and  Losses  from  Extinguishment  of  Debt,  Statement of Financial
     Accounting  No.  64,  Extinguishment  of  Debt made to satisfy Sinking-Fund
     Requirements,  and Statement of Financial Accounting No. 44, Accounting for
     Intangible  Assets  of Motor Carriers. This statement also amends Statement
     of  Financial  Accounting  No.  13,  Accounting for Leases, to eliminate an
     inconsistency  between  the  accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and
     the  accounting  for certain lease modifications that have economic effects
     that  are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. SFAS 145 is effective for
     fiscal years beginning after, transactions entered into after and financial
     statements  issued  on  or subsequent to May 15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS
     145  had  no  impact  on  financial  statements  of  the  Company.

     In  June  2002,  the  FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting No. 146
     ("SFAS  146"),  Accounting  for  Exit  or  Disposal  Activities.  SFAS  146
     addresses  the  recognition,  measurement,  and reporting of costs that are
     associated  with  exit  and disposal activities, including costs related to
     terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits
     that  employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of
     a  one-time  benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement
     or  an  individual  deferred-compensation  contract.  SFAS  146  supersedes


                                      -37-
<PAGE>
     Emerging  Issues  Task  Force  Issue  No.  94-3,  Liability Recognition for
     Certain  Employee  Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
     (including  Certain  Costs  Incurred  in  a  Restructuring),  and  requires
     liabilities  associated with exit and disposal activities to be expensed as
     incurred.  SFAS  146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated
     after  December  31,  2002.

3.   ACQUISITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     Acquisition of First Independence American Corporation ("IAHC")

     On  July  30,  2002, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire IAHC,
     formerly  First  Standard  Holdings  Corp.  from  SSH  Corp.  and  IHC  for
     $31,920,000  in cash. IAHC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are engaged in
     the  insurance  and  reinsurance business. Upon closing of the transaction,
     the  Company will become an insurance holding company, close its offices in
     San  Francisco,  terminate  all  but one of its employees, and enter into a
     services  agreement  with  IHC under which the Company's operations will be
     directed  by IHC management and employees. Consummation of this acquisition
     is  subject  to  satisfaction  of certain conditions, including approval by
     insurance  regulators  and  the  Company's  stockholders.  The  Company
     anticipates  the Company's stockholders will approve the transaction at the
     Special  Meeting  of  Stockholders  on  November  14,  2002.

     In  a  separate  transaction,  IHC  acquired  Pacific  Century  Cyberworks
     Limited's  ("PCCW")  entire interest in the Company consisting of 5,000,000
     common stock shares at $3.00 per share for a total value of $15,000,000. As
     a  result  of  this  transaction,  PCCW's  appointees Linus W.L. Cheung and
     Jeffrey  A.  Bowden  resigned  from  the  Company's Board of Directors, and
     Edward Netter, Chairman of IHC, and Roy T.K. Thung, Chief Executive Officer
     of  IHC,  were appointed to the Company's Board of Directors. Additionally,
     upon closing of the transaction, IHC has agreed to make a cash tender offer
     at  $3.00  per share for at least 3,000,000 outstanding common stock shares
     of  the  Company,  subject  to  certain  limitations.

     Acquisition  and  Discontinued  Operations  of  Intellicom

     On  February  9, 1999, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company merged with
     and  into  Intellicom  (the  "Intellicom  Acquisition").  The  Intellicom
     Acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method, and the results of
     Intellicom  have  been  included  in  the consolidated financial statements
     since  the  date  of  acquisition.  The  purchase  price of $14,869,000 was
     comprised  of: (i) a cash component of $500,000 (the "Cash Consideration");
     (ii) a promissory note in the amount of $1,000,000 bearing interest at 7.5%
     per  annum  and  due  one year after closing (the "First Promissory Note");
     (iii)  a  promissory  note  in the amount of $2,000,000 bearing interest at
     8.5%  per  annum  and  due  two years after closing (the "Second Promissory
     Note",  together  with  the First Promissory Note, are defined as the "Debt
     Consideration");  (iv)  the  issuance  of  500,000  shares of the Company's
     common  stock (adjustable upwards after one year in certain circumstances),
     valued  at $14.938 per share, for a total value of $7,469,000 (the "Closing
     Shares"); (v) additional shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon
     the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing, valued at a total
     of  $3,500,000 (the "Anniversary Shares", together with the Closing Shares,
     are  defined  as  the  "Equity  Consideration");  and  (vi)  certain direct
     acquisition  costs  totaling  $400,000.  The  Debt  Consideration  may  be
     partially  or  wholly  converted  into  the  Company's  common stock, under
     certain  circumstances.  The conversion price of the Debt Consideration was
     based  upon the average closing price of the Company's common stock for the
     15  days  immediately  preceding  the  conversion  date.

     In  April  1999,  the  Company  paid  the First Promissory Note and related
     interest  in full with a combination of $832,000 in cash and the remainder,
     after  expenses,  with  6,118  common  stock shares valued at $190,000. The
     Intellicom  Acquisition  agreement required the Company to issue $1,500,000
     of  common  stock  shares  on  the first anniversary date of the Intellicom
     Acquisition.  Accordingly,  on  February 8, 2000, the Company issued 43,314
     common  stock  shares  valued  at $1,499,000 and paid $1,000 for fractional
     shares  to  the  former  Intellicom  stockholders. On February 7, 2001, the
     Company  made  an  offer  to  the  former  Intellicom stockholders to pay a
     discounted amount in lieu of the Company's obligation to pay cash and stock
     for  the  remaining  consideration, which was to be paid in connection with
     the  Intellicom  acquisition  and  consisted  of  (i)  a  $2,000,000  8.5%
     promissory  note and accrued interest, (ii) the requirement for the Company
     to  issue  $1,500,000 of common stock shares on the second anniversary date
     of the Intellicom acquisition, and (iii) the requirement for the Company to
     issue  $500,000 of common stock shares on the third anniversary date of the
     Intellicom  acquisition.  The  parties  agreed  to settle the obligation by
     which the Company paid $2,815,000 (including accrued interest of $325,000),
     issued  99,922  common  stock  shares  valued at $199,000, and recognized a
     $1,326,000 extraordinary gain on settlements of outstanding obligations. On
     February  9,  2002, the Company issued 12,426 common stock shares to settle
     the  remaining obligations related to the requirement to issue common stock
     shares  on  the  third  anniversary  date  of  the  Intellicom acquisition.

     On March 29, 2002, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Intellicom,
     entered into an agreement to sell its operating business and certain assets
     to  Loral  Cyberstar, Inc. Following the sale of its operating business and
     certain  assets  to Loral Cyberstar, Inc., the Company's Board of Directors
     unanimously  agreed to cease the operations of Intellicom on April 3, 2002.
     On  April  22,  2002,  Intellicom entered into an agreement to sell certain
     assets  to  Native  Intellicom,  Inc.,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of the
     Pinoleville  Band  of Pomo Indians, for cash, subject to the termination of
     Intellicom's  lease for its facility in Livermore, California. On August 1,
     2002  Intellicom terminated the agreement with the Pinoleville Band of Pomo
     Indians  and  is  negotiating  to  a  sell those assets to another group of
     Native  Americans. The operating results of Intellicom have been segregated
     from  continuing  operations  and  are reported as a loss from discontinued
     operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of operations.
     Although  it  is  difficult  to  predict  the  final  results,  the loss on
     disposition from discontinued operations includes management's estimates of
     costs  to  wind  down  the  business,  costs  to  settle  its  outstanding
     liabilities,  and  the proceeds from the sale of assets. The actual results
     could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates.  The Company recorded an
     estimated  loss  on  disposition  of  Intellicom of $3,120,000 for the year
     ended September 30, 2002. The assets and liabilities of such operations are
     reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued operations of the
     accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets at September 30, 2002 and 2001.
     Through  September  30,  2002,  $2,274,000, primarily consisting of loss on
     sale  of  assets, net loss subsequent to March 31, 2002, severance payments
     and contract termination settlements, has been applied to this reserve. The
     remaining  $846,000  will  be utilized primarily for contract terminations.

     In  an effort to reduce Intellicom losses, the Company initiated an overall
     cost cutting program and organizational restructuring during May 2001. As a
     result  of  the  organizational  restructuring,  the  Company established a
     $1,290,000  restructuring  reserve,  which  consists of severance costs for
     affected  employees  and  shut  down  costs  for  certain  offices,  and is
     reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued operations of the
     accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets at September 30, 2002 and 2001.
     Through  September  30,  2002,  $1,290,000 of severance payments, and write
     offs  of leasehold improvements and office furniture related to the various
     offices  have  been  applied  to  this  reserve.

     Acquisition  of  Laptop  Lane,  Formation  of  Aerzone  and  Discontinued
     Operations  of  Aerzone

     On  January  24,  2000, the Company founded Aerzone (formerly SoftNet Zone,
     Inc.),  a  Delaware  corporation,  to provide high-speed Internet access to
     global  business  travelers.  As  part of the Aerzone business, the Company
     acquired  Laptop  Lane,  a  Washington  corporation, on April 21, 2000. The
     acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method, and the results of
     Laptop  Lane  have  been  included in the consolidated financial statements
     since  the  date of acquisition. The Company paid approximately $21,559,000
     consisting  of  (i)  972,266  common  stock shares of the Company valued at
     $15,107,000,  net  of adjustment for expenses paid by the Company on behalf
     of Laptop Lane, exchanged for all outstanding common stock shares of Laptop
     Lane,  (ii)  direct  acquisition  costs  of approximately $2,300,000, which
     included  a  bonus  payment to Laptop Lane employees of $431,000 in lieu of
     Laptop  Lane  stock  options,  and (iii) 250,000 common stock shares of the
     Company  valued  at $3,652,000 issued to former Laptop Lane stockholders in
     payment  for  achieving  certain  criteria.  As part of the acquisition, an
     additional  333,333  common  stock  shares  of  the  Company  were  to  be
     distributed to former Laptop Lane stockholders if certain performance goals
     or  other criteria were met. As of September 30, 2000, Laptop Lane achieved
     three  of  the  four  performance  goals; as a result, 249,981 common stock
     shares  of the Company and cash amounting to $3,652,000 were distributed to
     the  former Laptop Lane stockholders. In October 2000, Laptop Lane achieved
     the  fourth  performance goal requirement, resulting in the distribution of
     81,050  common stock shares of the Company valued at $332,000 to the former
     Laptop Lane stockholders. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition,
     the  Company provided $6,000,000 in working capital to Laptop Lane, under a
     secured  promissory  note, which was included as part of the purchase price
     consideration.

     On  December  19,  2000,  the  Company  decided  to discontinue the Aerzone
     business in light of significant long-term capital needs and the difficulty
     of  securing  the  necessary  financing because of the current state of the
     financial  markets.  The  operating results of Aerzone have been segregated
     from  continuing  operations  and  are  reported  as loss from discontinued
     operations  of  the  accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The
     loss  from  discontinued  operations includes management's estimates of the
     remaining  costs  to  wind  down  the  business  and  costs  to  settle its
     outstanding  liabilities. The assets and liabilities of such operations are
     reflected as net liabilities associated with discontinued operations of the
     accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets at September 30, 2002 and 2001.
     For  the  year  ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded an estimated


                                      -39-
<PAGE>
     loss  on  disposition reserve of Aerzone of $42,200,000. For the year ended
     September 30, 2001, the Company increased the estimated loss on disposition
     reserve  of  Aerzone  by  $14,906,000, primarily as a result of the Company
     reducing the estimated proceeds from the sale of Laptop Lane and increasing
     estimated  discontinued  operating  costs. For the year ended September 30,
     2002, the Company increased the estimated loss on disposition of Aerzone by
     $750,000,  as  a result of a superior court decision related to a breach of
     contract and other legal matters. The estimated loss on disposition reserve
     of  Aerzone  is  reflected  in net liabilities associated with discontinued
     operations of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at September 30,
     2002  and  2001,  and  the  corresponding  charge  is  reflected in loss on
     disposition  of  discontinued  operations  of the accompanying consolidated
     statements  of  operations for the years ended September 30, 2002, 2001 and
     2000.  Through  September  30,  2002,  $56,091,000, primarily consisting of
     intangibles  write  off,  loss  on  sale  of assets, net loss subsequent to
     September  30,  2000,  severance  payments  and  contract  termination
     settlements,  has  been  applied  to this reserve. The remaining $1,765,000
     will  be  utilized  primarily  for  contract  terminations  and legal fees.

     Following the sale of certain assets on August 16, 2001, Laptop Lane ceased
     operations  and  made  an  assignment  for  the benefit of creditors of its
     remaining  assets.

     Discontinued  Operations  of  ISP  Channel

     On  December  7,  2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to
     discontinue providing cable-based Internet services through its ISP Channel
     subsidiary  by December 31, 2000, because of (1) consolidation in the cable
     television  industry  made  it  difficult  for  ISP  Channel to achieve the
     economies  of  scale necessary to provide such services profitably, and (2)
     the  Company  was  no  longer able to bear the costs of maintaining the ISP
     Channel.  The  operating  results  of ISP Channel have been segregated from
     continuing operations and are reported as loss from discontinued operations
     of  the  accompanying  consolidated statements of operations. The loss from
     discontinued  operations  includes  management's estimates of the remaining
     costs  to  wind  down  the  business,  costs  to  settle  its  outstanding
     liabilities,  and  the  proceeds  from  the  sale of assets. The assets and
     liabilities  of such operations are reflected as net liabilities associated
     with  discontinued  operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated balance
     sheets  at  September  30,  2002 and 2001. For the year ended September 30,
     2000,  the Company recorded as estimated loss on disposition reserve of ISP
     Channel  of $97,200,000. For the year ended September 30, 2001, the Company
     decreased  the  estimated  loss  on  disposition  reserve of ISP Channel by
     $10,008,000,  primarily as a result of the Company experiencing better than
     previously estimated contract settlements. For the year ended September 30,
     2002,  the Company reduced the estimated loss on disposition reserve of ISP
     Channel  by  $900,000,  primarily  as  a result of the Company experiencing
     better  than  previously estimated contract settlements. The estimated loss
     on  disposition  reserve  of ISP Channel is reflected in net liabilities of
     discontinued  operations of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at
     September  30,  2002 and 2001, and the corresponding benefit and charge are
     reflected  in  loss  on  disposition  of  discontinued  operations  of  the
     accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for the years ended
     September 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Through September 30, 2002, $85,978,000,
     primarily  consisting of intangibles write off, loss on sale of assets, net
     loss  subsequent  to  September  30,  2000, severance payments and contract
     termination  settlements,  has  been applied to this reserve. The remaining
     $314,000  will  be  utilized  primarily  for  contract  terminations.

     Discontinued  Operations  of  Micrographic  Technology  Corporation ("MTC")

     As a result of a preliminary arbitration decision related to a dispute with
     Applications  Informatiques Multimedia and a dispute related to the sale of
     MTC to Global Information Distribution GmbH ("GID"), the Company recorded a
     $1,127,000  estimated loss on disposition reserve of MTC for the year ended
     September  30,  2002. MTC was previously owned by the Company, and was sold
     to  GID on September 30, 1999. The estimated loss on disposition reserve of
     MTC is reflected in net liabilities associated with discontinued operations
     of  the  accompanying consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2002, and
     the  corresponding  charge  is  reflected  in  loss  on  disposition  of
     discontinued  operations  of  the  accompanying  consolidated  statement of
     operations  for  the  year  ended September 30, 2002. Through September 30,
     2002,  $202,000  of  legal  fees  has  been  applied  to  this reserve. The
     remaining  $925,000 will be utilized primarily for the arbitration decision
     related to a dispute with Applications Informatiques Multimedia and related
     legal  fees.

4.   RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE

     On  December  28, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to
     reduce  its  corporate headquarters staff in conjunction with discontinuing
     the  Aerzone  and  ISP  Channel  businesses.  As a result of this plan, the
     Company  established  a  $3,900,000  restructuring  reserve, which consists
     primarily  of severance costs for affected employees. Subsequently, for the
     year  ended  September  30,  2002,  the Company increased the restructuring
     reserve  by  $502,000  for  additional  estimated  lease  termination costs
     associated  with  Company  headquarters.  The  restructuring  reserve  is
     reflected as restructuring accrual of the accompanying consolidated balance
     sheets  at  September  30,  2002  and  2001.  Through  September  30, 2002,
     $2,956,000  of  severance  payments  has  been applied to this reserve. The
     remaining $1,446,000 will be utilized primarily for lease termination costs
     associated  with  Company  headquarters.

5.   CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

     Short-term  investments, available-for-sale are carried at fair value based
     on  quoted  market prices. Net unrealized holding losses amounted to $6,000
     and  $464,000, and are based on the market value of securities at September
     30,  2002  and  2001,  respectively.  Net  unrealized  holding  losses  are
     reflected  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  of the accompanying
     consolidated  balance  sheets  at  September  30,  2002  and  2001.

6.   EQUITY INVESTMENTS

     On  February  12,  1999,  substantially  all  of  the  assets  of  the
     telecommunications  segment, Kansas Communications, Inc. ("KCI"), were sold
     to Convergent Communications Services, Inc. ("Convergent") for an aggregate
     sale  price  of  approximately  $6,300,000,  including  30,000  shares  of
     Convergent's  parent  company  common  stock  with  an  agreed  value  of
     approximately  $300,000  ($10.00  per  share)  (the  "Convergent  Shares"),
     subject  to  adjustment  in  certain events. Subsequently, a purchase price
     adjustment  provided  the Company with additional Convergent Shares with an
     agreed  value  of  $198,000  for a total investment in Convergent Shares of
     $498,000.  As  a result of Convergent's inability to secure funding for its
     cash  shortfall  and  subsequent  filing  on April 19, 2001, for protection
     under  Chapter  11  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code, the Company recognized
     an-other-than  temporary  decline  of $498,000 for the year ended September
     30,  2001.  The  other-than-temporary  decline  is reflected in the loss on
     disposition  of  equity  investments,  net of the accompanying consolidated
     statement  of  operations  for  the  year  ended  September  30,  2001.

     On  August  18,  1999,  the  Company  acquired 106,250 series A convertible
     preferred  stock  shares  of  YourDay.com,  Inc.  ("YourDay"),  a  Delaware
     corporation,  for  $250,000.  YourDay  was  a  leading  online calendar and
     scheduling  system that integrates Palm Pilots, telephones and the Internet
     anywhere  in  the world. Subsequently, on February 23, 2000, YourDay merged
     with  deltathree.com,  Inc.  ("Deltathree"),  a  Delaware  corporation. The
     merger  called  for each YourDay series A convertible preferred stock share
     be converted into .0469 Deltathree series A common stock share. The Company


                                      -42-
<PAGE>
     received 4,983 Deltathree series A common stock shares in the exchange, and
     accounted  for  the  exchange  at  fair  value, which resulted in a loss of
     $37,000  included in gain on disposition of long-term equity investments of
     the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of operations. Deltathree is a

     communications  to  individuals  and  businesses  worldwide.  Deltathree is
     listed and traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "DDDC". As
     a  result  of  problems facing Deltathree in attempting to raise additional
     financing  to  cover  projected  cash shortfalls, the Company recognized an
     other-than-temporary  decline  of $207,000 for the year ended September 30,
     2001.  The  other-than-temporary  decline  is  reflected  in  the  loss  on
     disposition  of  equity  investments,  net of the accompanying consolidated
     statement  of  operations  for  the  year  ended  September  30,  2001.

     On  February  23,  2000,  the  Company entered into an agreement to provide

     relationships  with  government-approved  partners  to offer high capacity,
     high  speed  Internet access and services in major urban markets throughout
     the  People's  Republic  of China. Subsequently, on September 29, 2000, the
     Company  sold its 50,000 Big Sky common stock shares for $13,830,000 to the
     other  owner of Big Sky, China Broadband Corporation ("China Broadband"), a
     Nevada  corporation,  which  resulted  in a gain of $10,194,000 included in
     gain  on  disposition  of  long-term equity investments of the accompanying
     consolidated  statements of operations. Proceeds from the sale consisted of
     (i)  $2,500,000 in cash, (ii) a promissory note in the amount of $1,700,000
     bearing  interest  at  8%  per  annum  due  September  29,  2001, and (iii)

     $1,700,000 promissory note and accrued interest, to Canaccord International
     Limited  for  $1,000,000. For this transaction, the Company recognized loss
     of $9,630,000 related to the 1,133,000 China Broadband common stock shares,
     and  a  loss  of  $768,000  related  to  the $1,700,000 promissory note and
     accrued  interest. The loss related to the 1,133,000 China Broadband common

     interest  are  reflected  in the loss on disposition of equity investments,

     preferred  stock  shares  of  YourStuff.com, Inc. ("YourStuff"), a Delaware
     corporation,  for  $250,000.  YourStuff provides a secure Web-based central
     file  repository.  Subsequently, on October 30, 2000, YourStuff merged with
     SenseNet,  Inc.  ("SenseNet"), a Delaware corporation. The Company received
     267,501 SenseNet common stock shares in the exchange, and accounted for the
     exchange  at  cost.  SenseNet  is  a  privately  held company that provides
     intranet  business  applications  that focus on increasing productivity and
     profitability.  As  a  result  of problems facing SenseNet in attempting to
     raise  needed  follow-on financing to cover projected cash shortfalls under
     current  stock  market  conditions, the Company wrote off the investment of
     $250,000  related  to the 267,501 SenseNet common stock shares for the year
     ended  September  30,  2001.  The  write  off  is  reflected in the loss on

     write  off  is  reflected in the loss on disposition of equity investments,

     shares.  The  loss  is  reflected  in  the  loss  on  disposition of equity
     investments,  net  of the accompanying consolidated statement of operations
     for  the  year  ended  September  30,  2001.

     to  acquire  3,000,000  series  A  convertible  preferred  stock  shares of
     Freewire  Networks,  Inc.  ("Freewire"),  a  Delaware  corporation,  for
     $3,000,000.  Freewire  was  a  privately  held  company developing wireless
     broadband  services  at  sporting  venues using IEEE 802.11 technology. The
     Company held Freewire in a corporate joint venture with Lucent Technologies
     Inc.  ("Lucent")  and  Freewire's  founding  management stockholders. Under
     certain  circumstances,  Lucent  had  the  option to require the Company to

     Company recognized equity losses of $415,000 that is reflected in equity in
     net losses of investee companies of the accompanying consolidated statement
     of  operations.  As  a  result of problems facing Freewire in attempting to

     current  stock  market conditions, the Company wrote off $2,622,000 related
     to  the  3,000,000 Freewire series A convertible preferred stock shares for
     the  year  ended September 30, 2001. The write off is reflected in the loss

     Company  breached  a  contract  by  failing  to purchase Lucent's shares in
     Freewire Networks, Inc. and claiming damages of approximately $3.5 million,
     which  may  increase  over  time.  On  December 31, 2001, the San Francisco
     Superior  Court  issued  an  order to deny Lucent's application for writ of
     attachment,  finding  that  Lucent  had not shown a substantial probability
     that  it  will  prevail on its claim. The Company continues to believe that
     Lucent's  claims  are  without  merit  and  will  be  contested vigorously.

     In  November  2000,  the Company acquired 1,000,000 common stock shares and
     400,000  preference  stock  shares  of SkyNet Global Limited ("SkyNet"), an

     5%  Convertible  Subordinated  Debentures  due  September  30, 2002, to Mr.
     R.C.W. Mauran, who was at the time of the transaction a beneficial owner of
     more  than 5% of the Company's common stock, in exchange for the assignment
     to  the Company of certain equipment leases and other consideration, all of
     which  had  been  assimilated  into the business of Micrographic Technology
     Corporation.  The  debentures  were  convertible  into the Company's common
     stock  at  $8.25  per share after December 31, 1998. On September 30, 2002,
     the  Company paid the principal of $1,444,000 and accrued interest in cash.

9.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     Operating  Leases

     The  Company has operating leases for office space and certain other office
     equipment.  These  operating leases provide for minimum rents and generally
     include  options  to renew for additional periods. The Company is currently
     in  negotiations  to  sublease  its  principal  executive  offices.

     Future  minimum  lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of
     September  30,  2002,  are  as  follows  (in  thousands):

                                     ======

     The  Company's  rent expense from continuing operations for the years ended
     September  30,  2002,  2001 and 2000, were $430,000, $499,000 and $649,000,
     respectively.

     Legal  Proceedings

     On  September  26,  2001,  Lucent  brought action in San Francisco Superior
     Court against the Company, alleging that the Company breached a contract by
     failing  to  purchase  Lucent's  shares in Freewire and claiming damages of
     approximately  $3.5  million, which may increase over time. On December 31,
     2001,  the  San  Francisco  Superior Court issued an order to deny Lucent's
     application  for  writ  of  attachment, finding that Lucent had not shown a
     substantial  probability  that  it  will  prevail on its claim. The Company
     continues  to  believe  that  Lucent's claims are without merit and will be
     contested  vigorously.

     On  November  9,  2001,  Nokia,  Inc.  ("Nokia") commenced an action in San
     Francisco  Superior  Court against the Company and Aerzone, alleging breach
     of  contract  arising  out  of the Aerzone's proposed operations in certain
     airports.  Nokia  seeks  approximately $2.1 million in damages. The Company
     believes that Nokia's claims are without merit and intends to contest these
     claims  vigorously. Additionally, the Company deposited security collateral
     of  $1,053,000 as required by the performance bond indemnity agreement with
     the  surety company. In the event that the Company prevails, any balance on
     the  collateral  will be returned by the surety company to the Company. The
     security  collateral  is  reflected  in  other  assets  of the accompanying
     consolidated  balance sheets at September 30, 2002, and September 30, 2001.

     On  October  30,  2001,  GID commenced a demand for arbitration against the
     Company, alleging breach of contract and warranties relating to the sale of
     MTC  to  GID  on  September  30, 1999. GID claims approximately $750,000 in
     damages. The Company believes GID's claims are without merit and intends to
     contest  these  claims  vigorously.

     The  Company  is also involved in other legal proceedings and claims, which
     arise  in  the  ordinary course of its discontinued businesses. The Company
     believes  the  results  of the above noted legal proceedings, other pending
     legal  proceedings  and  claims are not expected to have a material adverse
     effect  on  its  results  of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

10.  COMMON STOCK

     Common  Stock

     On  January  12,  1999,  the  Company  issued  $12,000,000 of its 9% Senior
     Subordinated  Convertible  Notes  (the  "Notes")  due January 1, 2001, to a
     group  of  institutional  investors.  These Notes were convertible into the
     Company's common stock with an initial conversion price of $17.00 per share
     until  July 1, 1999, and, thereafter, at the lower of $17.00 per share (the
     "Initial  Conversion  Price")  and  the lowest five-day average closing bid
     price of the Company's common stock during the 30-day trading period ending
     one  day  prior to the applicable conversion date (the "Conversion Price").
     In  connection  with  these  Notes,  the  Company issued to these investors
     warrants to purchase an aggregate of 300,000 shares of the Company's common
     stock. These warrants have an exercise price of $17.00 per share and expire
     in  2003.  On  April  28,  1999,  as a result of the Company's underwritten
     secondary  public  offering  (the "Secondary Offering"), and in conjunction
     with  an  anti-dilution  provision  associated  with the Notes, the Initial
     Conversion  Price was reduced from $17.00 to $16.49 per share. Furthermore,
     in  order  to secure three month lock-up agreements from the holders of the
     Notes  in conjunction with the Secondary Offering, the Company entered into
     a  new  arrangement  with  the  holders  of  the  Notes to issue all future
     interest  payments, beginning with the three months ended June 30, 1999, in
     the form of convertible notes with substantially the same form and features
     as the original Notes. Therefore, the Company issued an additional $549,000
     in notes, representing interest for the six months ended September 30, 1999
     (the  "Interest  Notes").  On  October  22, 1999, all of the Notes, related
     Interest  Notes  and accrued interest were converted into 765,201 shares of
     the  Company's  common  stock.

     On  September 15, 1995, the Company issued $2,856,000 of its 9% Convertible
     Subordinated  Debentures  due  September  15, 2000, in conjunction with the
     acquisition  of  MTC. The debentures were issued to the shareholders of MTC
     as  partial  consideration  for  the acquisition. These 9% debentures had a
     conversion  price  of  $6.75.  As of September 30, 1999, the Company issued
     222,200  common  stock  shares  pursuant to the conversion of $1,499,000 of
     these debentures. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company issued
     1,467  common  stock  shares  pursuant  to  the  conversion  of  $63,000 of
     convertible  debt by two separate holders of these debentures. On September
     15, 2000, the Company paid the remaining $1,294,000 of convertible debt and
     accrued  interest  in  cash.

     On  September  15,  1995,  in  association with the acquisition of MTC, the
     Company  assumed  $1,800,000  of  6%  Convertible  Subordinated  Secured
     Debentures  due  February  28,  2002.  These  6% debentures were subject to
     redemption  at  the  option of the Company at face value, provided however,
     that  the  Company  issued warrants to common stock shares purchase for the
     same  number  of  shares  as  would have been issued if the debentures were
     converted.  These  Debentures  were  convertible  into the Company's common
     stock at $8.25 per share after December 31, 1998. As of September 30, 1999,
     the  Company  issued 140,739 common stock shares pursuant to the conversion
     of  $1,140,000  of  these convertible debentures. Subsequently, on November
     15,  2000,  the  remaining  principal  of $660,000 and accrued interest was
     paid.

     On  December  13,  1999,  the  Company  completed  a  private  placement of
     5,000,000 common stock shares for net proceeds of $128,121,000 to PCCW, and
     entitled  PCCW  to  designate  two  persons  for  election  to the Board of
     Directors.  On  July  30,  2002, IHC acquired PCCW's entire interest in the
     Company  consisting of 5,000,000 common stock shares at $3.00 per share for
     a  total  value  of  $15,000,000.  As  a  result  of this transaction, PCCW
     appointees  Linus  W.L.  Cheung  and  Jeffrey  A.  Bowden resigned from the
     Company's  Board  of Directors, and Edward Netter, Chairman of IHC, and Roy
     T.K. Thung, Chief Executive Officer of IHC, were appointed to the Company's
     Board  of Directors. Additionally, upon closing of the acquisition of IAHC,
     IHC  has agreed to make a cash tender offer at $3.00 per share for at least
     3,000,000  outstanding  common  stock  shares  of  the  Company, subject to
     certain  limitations  (see  Note  3).


                                      -46-

     In conjunction with offering incentives to launch the Company's ISP Channel
     cable-based  Internet  services,  the  Company issued common stock to cable
     affiliates  in return for the exclusive rights to provide Internet services
     to  their  customers.  For  the  year ended September 30, 2000, the Company
     issued  35,160 common stock shares valued at $419,000 to two separate cable
     affiliates.  Further, on November 4, 1999, the Company entered into various
     definitive  agreements  with  Mediacom  LLC  ("Mediacom").  In exchange for
     signing an agreement to launch the ISP Channel services, the Company issued
     a  total  of  3,500,000 common stock shares to Mediacom, of which 3,150,000
     common  stock  shares  were restricted. The restrictions were progressively
     lifted  as  Mediacom  launched  ISP  Channel's services in Mediacom's cable
     television  systems.  At  September  30,  2000, there were 2,100,000 common
     stock  shares  restricted  and  unvalued. The unrestricted 1,400,000 common
     stock  shares  were  valued  at  $26,513,000  as  cable  affiliate  launch
     incentive.  As  a result of the Company discontinuing the operations of ISP
     Channel,  the  cable  affiliate  launch incentive, net of amortization, was
     written  off  and  reflected  in  the  loss  on disposition of discontinued
     operations for the year ended September 30, 2000. On February 16, 2001, the
     Company and ISP Channel entered into agreements with Mediacom, to terminate
     Mediacom's  affiliate  relationship  with  ISP  Channel.  As  part of these
     agreements  Mediacom released all obligations under the affiliate agreement
     with  ISP  Channel and returned 1,300,000 restricted common stock shares of
     the  Company,  and  in  exchange  received  certain equipment, a $3,768,000
     payment  from  the Company, and the Company removed restrictions on 800,000
     common  stock  shares  valued  at  $1,500,000  held  by  Mediacom. Mediacom
     currently  holds  a  total of 2,200,000 unrestricted common stock shares of
     the  Company.  Pursuant  to  these  agreements, neither the Company nor ISP
     Channel  has  any  further  material  obligation  to  Mediacom.

     On  July  30, 2002, the Company's Board of Directors approved a shareholder
     rights  plan  (the  "Plan"). Pursuant to the Plan's approval, the Company's
     Board  of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one Preferred Share
     Purchase  Right  (the "Rights") on each outstanding common stock share. The
     dividend  distribution  of  the  Rights  will  be  payable  to common stock
     stockholders  of  record on August 14, 2002. The Rights distribution is not
     taxable  to stockholders. Subject to limited exceptions, the Rights will be
     exercisable  if  a person or group acquires or announces a tender offer for
     4.99%  or  more of the Company's common stock. Under certain circumstances,
     each Right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-hundredth of a share of
     newly  created Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company
     at  an  exercise  price  of $3.00. The Company's Board of Directors will be
     entitled  to  redeem  the  Rights  at  $0.01 per Right at any time before a
     person  has  acquired  4.99%  or  more  of  the  outstanding  common stock.

     The  Rights  are  designed  to  inhibit  some acquisitions of the Company's
     common  stock  shares that could result in the imposition of limitations on
     the  use of its Federal net operating loss carryforwards and certain income
     tax  credits.  The  Rights  are also intended to enable all stockholders to
     realize  the long-term value of their investment in the Company. The Rights
     are  not  being  distributed  in response to any specific effort to acquire
     control  of  the  Company.  The Rights are designed to help protect the tax
     benefits  associated  with  the Company's net operating loss carryforwards.

     If a person becomes an Acquiring Person, each Right will entitle its holder
     to  purchase,  at  the Right's then-current exercise price, a number of the
     Company's  common  shares  having  a market value at that time of twice the
     Right's exercise price. The Rights held by the Acquiring Person will become
     void and will not be exercisable to purchase shares at the bargain purchase
     price.  If  Company  is  acquired in a merger or other business combination
     transaction  which  has  not  been  approved  by  the  Company's  Board  of
     Directors,  each  Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right's
     then-current  exercise  price,  a  number of the acquiring company's common
     shares  having  a  market  value at that time of twice the Right's exercise
     price.

     The Plan will expire on the close of business on the earliest date that (a)
     a  vote  of  Company's  stockholders  does  not  approve an amendment or an
     amendment  and  restatement  of  the Company's Certificate of Incorporation
     proposed  by  the Company's Board of Directors providing for limitations on
     the  acquisition  of  the  Company's  common  stock  in  excess  of certain
     percentage amounts, (b) such restated Certificate of Incorporation is filed
     with  the  Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or (c) the Company's
     stock  purchase  agreement with SSH Corp. and IHC is terminated, subject to
     the  Company's  right  to  extend  such  date  and  the  Company's  earlier
     redemption  or  exchange  of  such  rights  or  termination  of  the  Plan.

     On  May  17, 2002, the Company received a Nasdaq Staff Determination Letter
     stating  that  the  Company's  common  stock  was  no  longer  eligible for
     continued  listing on the Nasdaq National Market as a result of the Company
     ceasing  the  operations of its last business segment, Intellicom, and that
     the  Company  therefore did not meet the requirements for continued listing
     set  forth  in  Marketplace  Rules 4300 and 4330. Subsequently, the Company
     requested  and  was  granted  an  oral  hearing  before  a  Nasdaq  Listing
     Qualifications Panel to appeal the Nasdaq Staff Determination Letter, which
     stayed  the  delisting of the Company's common stock pending the outcome of


                                      -47-
<PAGE>
     the  hearing.  On  July  12,  2002,  the Company appeared before the Nasdaq
     Listing Qualifications Panel to present the Company's plan to acquire IAHC,
     which would allow the Company to comply with the Marketplace Rules 4300 and
     4330.  On August 15, 2002, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel informed
     the  Company that the Company will remain listed on Nasdaq National Market,
     subject  to  meeting  various  conditions,  including the completion of the
     acquisition of IAHC by December 31, 2002. The Nasdaq Listing Qualifications
     Panel  has  also  informed the Company that if it does remain listed on the
     Nasdaq National Market, following the acquisition of IAHC, the Company will
     be  required  to  meet  Nasdaq's  initial  listing  requirements as well as
     Nasdaq's  continued  listing  requirements.

11.  TREASURY STOCK

     On  August  15,  2000,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors authorized the
     repurchase  of  up  to  2,600,000  common  stock shares of the Company. The
     Company's  repurchases  of  common  stock  shares  are  recorded at cost as
     treasury  stock  and result in a reduction of stockholders' equity. For the
     years  ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company repurchased 1,881,000
     common  stock  shares  for  $6,858,000  and 409,500 common stock shares for
     $2,279,000,  respectively.

12.  2000 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN ("ESPP")

     On February 22, 2000, the Company adopted ESPP, which provides for eligible
     Company  employees  to  purchase  common  stock  shares  through  payroll
     deductions  during  six-month offering periods. Initial enrollment for ESPP
     began on March 13, 2000, for the first offering period of April 1, 2000, to
     June 30, 2000. Each subsequent offering period will begin July 1 or January
     1  and  end  December 31 or June 30, respectively. On February 2, 2001, the
     Company's  Board of Directors agreed to suspend ESPP indefinitely beginning
     July  1,  2001.

     Substantially  all employees are eligible for ESPP if they are employed for
     twenty (20) or more hours per week on the first day of the offering period.
     Eligible  employees  may  elect  to  contribute  up  to  15%  of their base
     compensation.

     ESPP  provides  for the purchase of common stock at the lower of 85% of the
     fair  market  value  of  the  common  stock  shares on the first day of the
     offering  period or 85% of the fair market value of the common stock shares
     on  the  last day of the offering period. A total of 1,325,000 common stock
     shares were reserved for issuance under ESPP. For the years ended September
     30,  2001  and  2000,  the  Company issued 56,769 common stock shares for a
     total value of $100,000 and 15,116 common stock shares for a total value of
     $145,000,  respectively.

13.  STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     1998  Stock  Incentive  Plan  ("1998  Plan")

     Effective October 1, 1998, the Company implemented the 1998 Plan, which the
     Company's  stockholders  approved  on  April 13, 1999. Concurrent with such
     stockholder  approval,  all  outstanding  stock options under the Company's
     1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") were incorporated into
     the  1998  Plan, and no further stock option grants or stock issuances were
     made  under the Incentive Plan. The incorporated stock options continued to
     be governed by their existing terms. However, the Administrator of the 1998
     Plan  could  elect  to  extend one or more features of the 1998 Plan to the
     incorporated  stock  options.  As  of  September  30,  2002,  the 1998 Plan
     Administrator  has  not  elected  to extend any of the features of the 1998
     Plan  to  the  incorporated  stock  options.  Each  stock  option under the
     Incentive  Plan  was  granted  at  an exercise price not less than the fair
     market  value  of  the Company's common stock on the grant date, and vested
     equally  over  a  three  year  period on the yearly anniversary date of the
     grant. The 1998 Plan provides for the grants of non-statutory and incentive
     stock  options,  stock  appreciation  rights,  restricted  stock  awards,
     performance  shares,  and  other  awards  to  officers, employees and other
     individuals. Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, stock options have a maximum
     term of ten years from the date of grant, and have various vesting criteria
     depending  on  the  grant  with  most  grants vesting 25% on the first year
     anniversary  date  of  the  grant  and  ratably over the next 36 months. In
     addition, the number of common stock shares reserved for issuance under the
     1998  Plan  will  automatically  increase  on the first trading day of each
     calendar  year, beginning in calendar year 2000, by an amount equal to four
     percent  of the total number of common stock shares outstanding on the last
     trading  day  of the preceding calendar year, but in no event will any such
     annual  increase  exceed  2,000,000  shares,  subject  to  adjustment  for
     subsequent  stock  splits,  stock  dividends  and  similar transactions. At
     September  30,  2002, a total of 6,473,738 common stock shares are reserved
     for  issuance under the 1998 Plan. At September 30, 2002, stock options for
     894,228  common  stock  shares  were outstanding, stock options for 758,394
     common stock shares were vested, and 5,579,510 common stock shares remained
     available  for  future  stock  option  grants  and  other  awards.

<PAGE>
     1999  Supplemental  Stock  Incentive  Plan  ("1999  Plan")

     The  Company's  1999  Plan is an equity incentive program for employees and
     consultants,  who are neither officers nor directors of the Company. Awards
     under  the  1999 Plan may, in general, be made in the form of non-statutory
     stock  option grants, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards or
     performance  shares.  Each stock option is granted at an exercise price not
     less  than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the grant
     date,  and  generally  vests  over  a  four year period. A total of 750,000
     common  stock  shares  are  reserved  for  issuance under the 1999 Plan. At
     September  30,  2002,  stock  options  for  10,000 common stock shares were
     outstanding,  stock  options for 7,083 common stock shares were vested, and
     740,000  common  stock  shares  remained  available for future stock option
     grants  and  other  awards.

     Micrographic Technology Corporation Employee Stock Option Plan ("MTC Plan")

     The  Company's  former  MTC Plan was an equity incentive program, which was
     established for the employees of MTC. The Company sold MTC on September 30,
     1999  (See Note 3). A total of 40,000 common stock shares were reserved for
     issuance  under  the MTC Plan. All stock options granted under the MTC Plan
     are  designed  to  qualify as incentive stock options under the federal tax
     laws. Each stock option grant vests equally over a three year period on the
     yearly  anniversary  date  of  the  grant. For the year ended September 30,
     2002,  stock  options  for  1,693  common  stock  shares  were canceled. At
     September  30,  2002,  no  stock  options  for  common  stock  shares  were
     outstanding and fully vested, and no common stock shares remained available
     for  future  stock  options  grants.

     Non-Plan  Consultant  and  Employee  Stock  Options

     The  Company  granted  stock  options on terms not available under the 1998
     Plan  or  the 1999 Plan to certain consultants as partial consideration for
     services  rendered  and to certain employees. As of September 30, 2002, the
     Company  has  granted  to consultants non-plan stock options to purchase an
     aggregate  of  107,500  common  stock  shares, and employees non-plan stock
     options  to  purchase an aggregate of 54,500 common stock shares. The stock
     options  typically vest over the period of contracted service. The exercise

     Common  Stock  Warrants

     On  December  31,  1997, the Company issued to RGC International Investors,
     LDC ("RGC"), 5,000 Series A Preferred Stock shares and warrants to purchase
     150,000  common  stock  shares  (the  "Series A Warrants") for an aggregate
     purchase  price  of  $5,000,000;  $435,000  of  the purchase price has been
     allocated  to  the  value of the Series A Warrants. The conversion price of
     the  Series A Preferred Stock was equal to the lower of $8.28 per share and
     the  lowest  consecutive  two-day average closing price of the common stock
     during  the 20-day trading period immediately prior to such conversion. The
     sale  was arranged by Shoreline Pacific Institutional Finance ("SPIF"), the
     Institutional  Division  of  Financial  West Group, which received a fee of
     $250,000  plus  warrants  to purchase 20,000 common stock shares, which are
     exercisable  at  $6.625 and expire on December 31, 2000. For the year ended

     dividends  paid  in  kind.

     On  May 28, 1998, the Company issued to RGC and Shoreline Associates I, LLC

     respectively,  and  warrants  to  purchase  180,000 and 20,000 common stock
     shares  (the  "Series B Warrants"), respectively, for an aggregate purchase
     price  of $10,000,000; $900,000 of the purchase price has been allocated to
     the  value  of  the  Series  B  Warrants.  Prior  to February 28, 1999, the
     conversion  price  of  the Series B Preferred Stock was equal to $13.20 per
     share. Thereafter, the conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock was
     equal  to  the  lower  of  $13.20 per share and the lowest five-day average
     closing  price  of  the  common  stock  during  the  20-day  trading period
     immediately  prior to such conversion. The sale was arranged by SPIF, which
     received  a  fee  of $500,000 plus warrants to purchase 50,000 common stock
     shares,  which  are exercisable at $11.00 and expire on May 28, 2002. As of
     September  30,  1999,  RGC and Shoreline received 226.40 and 25.16 Series B
     Preferred  Stock  shares,  respectively,  as  dividends  paid  in  kind.

     Stock  shares  and  warrants  to  purchase  93,750 common stock shares (the
     "Series  C  Warrants")  for  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of $7,500,000;
     $277,000  of  the  purchase  price  has  been allocated to the value of the
     Series  C  Warrants.  Prior  to  May  31, 1999, the conversion price of the
     Series  C  Preferred  Stock  was  equal to $9.00 per share. Thereafter, the
     conversion  price of the Series C Preferred Stock was equal to the lower of
     $9.00 per share and the lowest five-day average closing price of the common
     stock  during  the  30-day-trading  period  immediately  prior  to  such


                                      -49-

     conversion. The sale was arranged by SPIF, which received a fee of $375,000
     plus warrants to purchase 26,250 common stock shares, which are exercisable
     at  $7.50  and  expire  on  August  31, 2002. As of September 30, 1999, RGC
     received  125.39 Series C Preferred Stock shares as dividends paid in kind.

     As  of  September 30, 1999, all of the Preferred Stock, including dividends
     paid-in-kind  and  accrued  interest,  were  converted into an aggregate of
     2,404,464 common stock shares of the Company. Additionally, all warrants to
     purchase common stock shares related to the issuance of the Preferred Stock
     were  exercised  as  of  September  30,  2000.

     On  March  22,  1999,  the Company issued warrants to purchase 3,013 common
     stock  shares  to  an  institutional lender in connection with a $3,000,000
     credit  facility.  The  credit  facility  was  used to fund certain capital
     equipment  acquisitions. The warrants have an exercise price of $29.875 and
     expire  on  March  22, 2003. The fair value of the warrants on the issuance
     date  was  estimated  using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
     following  assumptions:  volatility  of  108%,  risk  free interest rate of
     4.78%,  no  dividend yield, and an expected contractual life of four years.

     Stock  Option  Compensation  on  a  Pro  Forma  Basis

     As  allowed  by  SFAS 123, the Company continues to apply the provisions of
     APB  25,  in  accounting  for  its  stock  based  employee  compensation
     arrangements  and  discloses  the  pro  forma  net  loss and loss per share
     information  as  if  the  fair  value method suggested in SFAS 123 had been
     applied.

     Had  compensation  cost  for  the  Company's  stock-based  compensation
     arrangements for employees been determined based on the fair value at grant
     date  of  the awards for the years ended September 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000,

     As  a  result  of the Company not granting stock options for the year ended

14.  DEFERRED COMPENSATION

     From  October  1, 1998 to April 12, 1999, the Company, pursuant to the 1998
     Plan,  granted  1,618,550  incentive and non-qualified common stock options
     with  a  weighted  average  exercise  price  of $12.74 per share to certain
     employees.  As a result of the adoption of the 1998 Plan (see Note 13), and
     in  accordance  with APB 25, the Company recorded a non-cash deferred stock
     compensation  charge  of $77,361,000 related to the issuance of these stock
     options.  Deferred stock compensation is amortized on a straight-line basis
     over  the  remaining  vesting  period of such stock options to compensation
     related  to stock options. For the years ended September 30, 2002, 2001 and
     2000,  the  Company  recognized  compensation  expense (benefit) related to
     these  stock options of $1,501,000, which includes $35,000 allocated to the
     discontinued  operations  of  Intellicom;  $(1,279,000),  which  includes
     $(472,000)  allocated  to  the  discontinued  operations of ISP Channel and
     Intellicom;  and  $18,711,000,  which  includes $4,043,000 allocated to the
     discontinued  operations  of  ISP  Channel  and  Intellicom,  respectively.

     Also,  in  accordance  with  SFAS  123  the  Company  recognized  deferred
     compensation  charges  of  approximately  $1,890,000  with  respect  to the
     140,500  stock  options  granted  to  certain  consultants.  These deferred
     compensation  charges  were  amortized,  on  an  accelerated basis over the
     vesting  period  of  such  options, in accordance with Financial Accounting
     Standards  Board  Interpretation  No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation
     Rights  and  Other  Variable  Stock  Option or Award Plans. No compensation
     expense  related  to  these stock options was recognized for the year ended
     September  30,  2002.  For the years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, the
     Company  recognized  compensation  expense (benefit) related to these stock
     options  of  $(31,000)  and  $261,000,  respectively.

15.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     On November 4, 1999, the Company entered into various definitive agreements
     with  Mediacom  LLC  ("Mediacom").  In exchange for signing an agreement to
     launch  the  ISP  Channel services, the Company issued a total of 3,500,000
     common stock shares to Mediacom, of which 3,150,000 shares were restricted.
     The  restrictions  were  progressively  lifted  as  Mediacom  launched  ISP
     Channel's services in Mediacom's cable television systems. At September 30,
     2000, there were 2,100,000 shares restricted and unvalued. The unrestricted
     1,400,000  shares  were  valued  at  $26,513,000  as cable affiliate launch
     incentive.  As  a result of the Company discontinuing the operations of ISP
     Channel,  the  cable  affiliate  launch incentive, net of amortization, was
     written  off  and  reflected  in  the  loss  on disposition of discontinued
     operations for the year ended September 30, 2000. On February 16, 2001, the
     Company and ISP Channel entered into agreements with Mediacom, to terminate


                                      -51-
<PAGE>
     Mediacom's  affiliate  relationship  with  ISP  Channel.  As  part of these
     agreements  Mediacom released all obligations under the affiliate agreement
     with  ISP  Channel and returned 1,300,000 restricted common stock shares of
     the  Company,  and  in  exchange  received  certain equipment, a $3,768,000
     payment  from  the Company, and the Company removed restrictions on 800,000
     common  stock  shares  valued  at  $1,500,000  held  by  Mediacom. Mediacom
     currently  holds  a  total of 2,200,000 unrestricted common stock shares of
     the  Company.  Pursuant  to  these  agreements, neither the Company nor ISP
     Channel  has  any  further  material  obligation  to  Mediacom.

16.  INCOME TAXES

     The Company has not recorded provisions or benefits for U.S. federal, state
     or  local  income  taxes  for  the years ended September 30, 2002, 2001 and
     2000,  as  a  result of the Company's net operating losses, and differences
     from  the  amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of
     35% to pretax loss due primarily to the valuation allowance on deferred tax
     assets.

     The  tax  effects  of  temporary  differences that give rise to significant
     portions  of  the  deferred  tax  assets  are  as  follows  (in thousands):

     The  valuation  allowance for deferred tax assets at September 30, 2002 and
     2001,  was  $96,416,000  and  $91,945,000,  respectively.  The  change  in
     valuation  allowance  for  the years ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, was
     $4,471,000 and $42,863,000, respectively. In assessing the realizability of
     deferred  tax  assets,  management considers whether it is more likely than
     not  that  some  portion  or  all  of  the  deferred tax assets will not be
     realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
     the  generation  of future taxable income during the periods in which those
     temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
     reversal  of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and
     tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Management believes that
     sufficient  uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred
     tax  assets and, accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been provided.

     The  Company  has  net  operating  loss carryforwards for federal and state
     income  tax  purposes  of  approximately  $263,636,000  and  $27,582,000,
     respectively,  available  to  reduce future income subject to income taxes.
     The federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in fiscal years 2005 to
     2022.  The  state  net  operating loss carryforwards expire in fiscal years
     2005  to  2014.

     At  September  30,  2002,  $15,774,000 of the net operating loss related to
     stock  option exercises; the related tax benefits will be charged to equity
     when  utilized  for  tax  purposes.

     U.S. federal and California tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the
     utilization  of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of
     an  "ownership  change"  for tax purposes, as defined in Section 382 of the
     Internal  Revenue  Code.  For  tax  purposes,  an ownership change occurred
     during  1999 and, as a result, utilization of the net operating losses will
     be  subject  to  an  annual  limitation  in  future  years.

19.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     At  the Special Meeting of Stockholders on November 14, 2002, the Company's
     stockholders  approved  the  stock  purchase agreement dated as of July 30,
     2002,  to  acquire First Standard Holdings Corp. from SSH Corp. and IHC for
     $31,920,000  in  cash,  and  approved the Company's name change to American
     Independence  Corp.  Also on November 14, 2002, the Company consummated the
     transacations  comtemplated  by  the  Purchase Agreement and First Standard
     Holdings  Corp.  changed  its  name to Independence American Holdings Corp.
     The  acquisition of IAHC may result in a change in management's belief that
     sufficient  uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred
     tax  assets, as one of the potential benefits of the acquisition of IAHC is
     that  the  Company's  federal  tax  net operating loss carryforwards may be
     utilized  against any  subsequent  profits  from  IAHC's  business.

1.   I  have  reviewed  this annual report on Form 10-K of American Independence
     Corp.;

2.   Based  on  my  knowledge,  this  annual  report does not contain any untrue
     statement  of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
     make  the  statements  made, in light of the circumstances under which such
     statements  were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by
     this  annual  report;

3.   Based  on  my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and other financial
     information  included in this annual report, fairly present in all material
     respects  the  financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this annual report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officers  and  I  are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in  Exchange  Act  Rules  13a-14  and  15d-14) for the registrant and have:

     a.   designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to  ensure that
          material  information  relating  to  the  registrant,  including  its
          consolidated  subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
          entities,  particularly  during the period in which this annual report
          is  being  prepared;
     b.   evaluated  the  effectiveness  of the registrant's disclosure controls

     committee  of  registrant's  board  of directors (or persons performing the
     equivalent  functions):

     a.   all  significant  deficiencies  in the design or operation of internal
          controls  which  could  adversely  affect  the registrant's ability to
          record,  process,  summarize  and  report  financial  data  and  have
          identified  for  the  registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in
          internal  controls;  and
     b.   any  fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees  who  have  a  significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls;  and

6.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officers and I have indicated in this
     annual  report  whether there were significant changes in internal controls
     or  in  other  factors  that  could  significantly affect internal controls
     subsequent  to  the  date  of  our  most  recent  evaluation, including any
     corrective  actions  with  regard  to significant deficiencies and material
     weaknesses.

                              SOFTNET SYSTEMS, INC.

     (Pursuant to Sections 242 and 245 of the Delaware General Corporation Law)
George L. Hernandez hereby certifies that:

     A.   He is the Secretary of SoftNet Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation.

     B. The certificate of incorporation of this corporation was originally
filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on April
7, 1999.

     C. The text of the Certificate of Incorporation of this corporation is
amended and restated to read in its entirety as follows:

                                  ARTICLE FIRST

     The name of this corporation is American Independence Corp. (the
"Corporation" or the "Company").

                                 ARTICLE SECOND

     The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of
Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle.
The name of its registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust
Company.

                                  ARTICLE THIRD

     The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity
for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of
Delaware.

                                 ARTICLE FOURTH

     (A) This Corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be
designated, respectively, "Common Stock" and "Preferred Stock." The total number
of shares which the Corporation is authorized to issue is 104,000,000 shares.
100,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, $.01 par value, and 4,000,000 shares
shall be Preferred Stock, $.10 par value.

     (B) The Board of Directors may issue Preferred Stock from time to time in
one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized to adopt a
resolution or resolutions from time to time, within the limitations and
restrictions stated in this Certificate of Incorporation, to fix or alter the
voting powers, designations, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations
and restrictions of any wholly unissued class of Preferred Stock, or any wholly
unissued series of any such class, and the number of shares constituting any
such series and the designation thereof, or any of them, and to increase or
decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issue of shares of
that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding.
In case the number of shares of any series shall be so decreased, the shares
constituting such decrease shall resume the status which they had prior to the
adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such
series.

                                  ARTICLE FIFTH

     A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's
duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived any improper
personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended after
approval by the stockholders of this Article to authorize corporation action
further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors then the
liability of a director of the corporation


                                     Page 1
<PAGE>
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law as so amended.

     Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article
Fifth by the stockholders of the corporation shall not adversely affect any
right or protection of a director of the corporation existing at the time of
such repeal or modification.

                                  ARTICLE SIXTH

     The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders
herein are granted subject to this reservation.

                                 ARTICLE SEVENTH

     Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of
the Corporation shall so provide.

                                 ARTICLE EIGHTH

     The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors
shall be fixed from time to time by, or in the manner provided in, the bylaws or
amendment thereof duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders.

                                  ARTICLE NINTH

     Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of
Delaware, as the Bylaws may provide. The books of the corporation may be kept
(subject to any provision contained in the statutes) outside the State of
Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the
Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

                                  ARTICLE TENTH

     Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation, in
furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board
of Directors is expressly authorized to make, repeal, alter, amend and rescind
any or all of the Bylaws of the Corporation.

                                ARTICLE ELEVENTH

     The Corporation expressly elects to be governed by Section 203 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

                                 ARTICLE TWELVE

     Except as expressly provided below in this Article XII, shares of capital
stock of the Corporation are fully and freely transferable.

     (A) Limitations on Transfer of Shares; Certain Transfers Prohibited.
         ---------------------------------------------------------------

          1. If an individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,
     trust, unincorporated organization or other entity, as well as any
     syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (each a "Person"), shall
     attempt to sell, transfer, or dispose, or purchase or acquire in any manner
     whatsoever, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or
     otherwise (any such sale, transfer, disposition, purchase or acquisition
     being a "Transfer"), any shares of capital stock of the Corporation or any
     option, warrant or other right to purchase or acquire capital stock of the
     Corporation (such warrant, option, or security being an "Option") or any
     securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock of the
     Corporation, and such Transfer shall affect the percentage of capital stock
     that is treated as owned by a five percent shareholder (within the meaning
     of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
     "Code") and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) with respect
     to the Corporation (a "Five Percent Shareholder"), then such Person shall
     be a "Restricted Holder", and such Transfer shall not be permitted except
     as authorized pursuant to this Article XII; provided, however, that for
     purposes of determining


                                     Page 2
<PAGE>
     the existence and identity of, and the amount of capital stock owned by,
     any Five Percent Shareholders or Restricted Holders, the Corporation is
     entitled to rely conclusively on (a) the existence and absence of filings
     of Schedules 13D and 13G (or any similar schedules) as of any date and (b)
     its actual knowledge of the ownership of its capital stock. For purposes of
     this Article XII, "capital stock" shall include the Common Stock and the
     Preferred Stock of the Corporation.

          2. The restrictions contained in this Article XII are for the purpose
     of reducing the risk that any change in stock ownership may jeopardize the
     preservation of the Corporation's federal, state and local income tax
     attributes. In connection therewith, and to provide for the effective
     policing of these provisions, a Restricted Holder who proposes to Transfer
     shares of capital stock shall, prior to the date of the proposed Transfer,
     request in writing (a "Request") that the Board of Directors of the
     Corporation review the proposed Transfer and authorize or not authorize the
     proposed Transfer pursuant to subsection C hereof. A Request shall be
     mailed or delivered to the President of the Corporation at the
     Corporation's principal place of business or telecopied to the
     Corporation's telecopier number at its principal place of business. Such
     Request shall be deemed to have been delivered when actually received by
     the Corporation. A Request shall include (a) the name, address and
     telephone number of the Restricted Holder, (b) a description of the shares
     of capital stock proposed to be Transferred by or to the Restricted Holder,
     (c) the date on which the proposed Transfer is expected to take place, (d)
     the name of the proposed transferor and transferee of the capital stock to
     be Transferred by or to the Restricted Holder, and (e) a Request that the
     Board of Directors authorize, if appropriate, the Transfer pursuant to
     subsection C hereof and inform the Restricted Holder of its determination
     regarding the proposed Transfer. If the Restricted Holder seeks to sell or
     dispose of shares of capital stock, then, within five business days of
     receipt by the President of the Corporation of a Request, a meeting of the
     Board of Directors shall be held to determine whether to authorize the
     proposed Transfer described in the Request under subsection C hereof. If
     the Restricted Holder seeks to purchase or acquire shares of capital stock,
     at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors following
     the fifth business day after receipt by the President of the Corporation of
     a Request, the Board of Directors will meet to determine whether to
     authorize the proposed Transfer described in the Request under subsection C
     hereof. The Board of Directors shall conclusively determine whether to
     authorize the proposed Transfer, in its sole discretion and judgment, and
     shall immediately cause the Restricted Holder making the Request to be
     informed of such determination.

     (B) Effect of Unauthorized Transfer. Any Transfer attempted to be made in
         --------------------------------
violation of this Article XII will be null and void. In the event of an
attempted or purported Transfer involving a sale or disposition of capital stock
in violation of this Article XII, the Restricted Holder shall remain the owner
of such shares. In the event of an attempted or purported Transfer involving the
purchase or acquisition by a Restricted Holder in violation of this Article XII,
the Corporation shall be deemed to be the exclusive and irrevocable agent for
the transferor of such capital stock. The Corporation shall be such agent for
the limited purpose of consummating a sale of such shares to a Person who is not
a Restricted Holder (an "eligible transferee"), which may include, without
limitation, the transferor. The record ownership of the subject shares shall
remain in the name of the transferor until the shares have been sold by the
Corporation or its assignee, as agent, to an eligible transferee. The
Corporation shall be entitled to assign its agency hereunder to any person or
entity including, but not limited to, the intended transferee of the shares, for
the purpose of effecting a permitted sale of such shares. Neither the
Corporation, as agent, nor any assignee of its agency hereunder, shall be deemed
to be a stockholder of the Corporation nor be entitled to any rights of a
stockholder of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, any right to vote
such capital stock or to receive dividends or liquidating distributions in
respect thereof, if any, but the Corporation or its assignee shall only have the
right to sell and transfer such shares on behalf of and as agent for the
transferor to another person or entity; provided, however, that a Transfer to
such other person or entity does not violate the provisions of this Article XII.
The rights to vote and to receive dividends and liquidating distributions with
respect to such shares shall remain with the transferor. The intended transferee
shall not be entitled to any rights of stockholders of the Corporation,
including, but not limited to, the rights to vote or to receive dividends and
liquidating distributions with respect to such shares. In the event of a
permitted sale and transfer, whether by the Corporation or its assignee, as
agent, the proceeds of such sale shall be applied first to reimburse the
Corporation or its assignee for any expenses incurred by the Corporation acting
in its role as the agent for the sale of such shares, second to the extent of
any remaining proceeds, to reimburse the intended transferee for any payments
made to the transferor by such intended transferee for such shares, and the
remainder, if any, to the original transferor.

     (C) Authorization of Transfer of Capital Stock by a Restricted Holder. The
         -----------------------------------------------------------------
Board of Directors may authorize a Transfer by a Restricted Holder, or to a
Restricted Holder, if, in its sole discretion and judgment it determines that
the Transfer is in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders.
In deciding whether to approve any proposed Transfer of capital stock by or to a
Restricted Holder, the Board of Directors may seek the advice of


                                     Page 3
<PAGE>
counsel with respect to the Corporation's preservation of its federal income tax
attributes pursuant to Code Section 382 and may request all relevant information
from the Restricted Holder with respect to all capital stock directly or
indirectly owned by such Restricted Holder. Any Person who makes a Request of
the Board of Directors pursuant to this subsection C to Transfer shares of
capital stock shall reimburse the Corporation, on demand, for all costs and
expenses incurred by the Corporation with respect to any proposed Transfer of
capital stock, including, without limitation, the Corporation's costs and
expenses incurred in determining whether to authorize that proposed Transfer.

     (D) Damages. Any Restricted Holder who knowingly violates the provisions of
         -------
this Article XII, and any persons controlling, controlled by or under common
control with such a Restricted Holder, shall be jointly and severally liable to
the Corporation for, and shall indemnify and hold the Corporation harmless
against, any and all damages suffered as a result of such violation, including
but not limited to damages resulting from a reduction in or elimination of the
Corporation's ability to utilize its federal, state and local income tax
attributes under Code Section 382 (or equivalent provisions of state or local
law), and attorneys' and accountants' fees incurred in connection with such
violation.

     (E) Legend on Certificates. All certificates for shares of Common Stock
         ----------------------
issued by the Corporation shall conspicuously bear the following legend:

     "The Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate") of the Corporation
     contains restrictions prohibiting the sale, transfer, disposition, purchase
     or acquisition (collectively, the "Transfer") of any capital stock without
     the authorization of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board
     of Directors"), if such Transfer affects the percentage of capital stock
     that is treated as owned by a five percent shareholder (within the meaning
     of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
     "Code") and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), and such
     Transfer would, in the sole discretion and judgment of the Board of
     Directors, jeopardize the Corporation's preservation of its federal income
     tax attributes pursuant to Section 382 of the Code and is not otherwise in
     the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders. The Corporation
     will furnish without charge to the holder of record of this certificate a
     copy of the Certificate, containing the above-referenced restrictions on
     transfer of stock, upon written request to the Corporation at its principal
     place of business.

     D. The foregoing amendment and restatement of the Certificate of
Incorporation has been duly approved by the corporation's Board of Directors and
stockholders in accordance with the provisions of Section 242 and 245 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has signed this Certificate this 14th
day of November, 2002.

not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize
or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted.  Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those
stockholders who have not consented in writing.

                            ARTICLE III -- DIRECTORS

directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual
election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless
sooner displaced.  If there are no directors in office, then an election of
directors may be held in the manner provided by statute.  If, at the time of
filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in
office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted
immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon
application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10%)
percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the
right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill
any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors
chosen by the directors then in office.

Section 3.  The business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the
direction of its Board, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation
and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the
certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws directed or required to be
exercised or done by the stockholders.

Section 4.  The Board of the Corporation may hold meetings, both regular and
special, either in or out of Delaware.

Section 5.  The first meeting of each newly elected Board shall be held at such
time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual
meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected
directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be
present.  In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or
place of such first meeting of the newly elected Board, or in the event such
meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the
meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice
given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board, or as shall be
specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.

Section 6.  Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice at such

manner and on like notice on the written request of two directors unless the
board consists of only one director, in which case special meetings shall be
called in like manner and on like notice on the written request of the sole
director.

Section 8.  At all meetings of the Board a majority of the directors shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of
the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act
of the Board, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by
the certificate of incorporation.  If a


                                                                               2
<PAGE>
quorum  shall  not be present at any meeting of the Board, the directors present
thereat  may  adjourn the meeting, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting,  until  a  quorum  shall  be  present.

Section 9.  Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation, any
action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or of any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board or
committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writings are
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.

Section 10.  Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or
these bylaws, members of the Board, or any committee designated by the Board,
may participate in a meeting of the Board, or any committee, by means of
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation
in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

Section 11.  The Board may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole
board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or
more of the directors of the Corporation.  The Board may designate one or more
directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or
disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.  In the absence of
disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof
present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not
constituting a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to
act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.  Any
such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board, shall
have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the
management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the
seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no
such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to amending the
certificate of incorporation, adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation,
recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or
substantially all of the Corporation's property and assets, recommending to the
stockholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution,
or amending the bylaws of the Corporation; and, unless the resolution or the
certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have
the power or authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of
stock.  Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be
determined by resolution adopted by the Board.

Section 12.  Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and
report the same to the Board when required.

Section 13.  Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation,
the Board shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors.  The
directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of
the Board or a committee thereof and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at
each meeting of the Board or a committee thereof or a stated salary as director.
No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any
other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

Section 14.  Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or
bylaw, any director or the entire Board may be removed, with or without cause,
by the holders of a majority of shares entitled to vote at an election of
directors.

Section 1.  Whenever, under the provisions of the statutes or of the certificate
of incorporation or of these bylaws, notice is required to be given to any
director or stockholder, it shall not be construed to mean personal notice, but
such notice may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such director or
stockholder, at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation,

amount of the consideration to be paid therefor, and the amount paid thereon
shall be specified.

officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

Section 4.  The Board may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued
in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the
Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of

against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.


                                                                               5

other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall
not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting,

registered on its books as the owner of shares and shall not be bound to
recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on
the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other
notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

                        ARTICLE VII -- GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 1.  Dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation, subject to the
provisions of the certificate of incorporation, if any, may be declared by the
Board at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law.  Dividends may be paid
in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the
provisions of the certificate of incorporation.

Section 2.  Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any
funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the
directors, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves
to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or
maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such other purposes as the
directors shall think conducive to the interest of the Corporation, and the
directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was
created.

Section 3.  All checks or demands for money and notes of the Corporation shall
be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the
Board may designate.

Section 4.  The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by resolution of
the Board.

Section 5.  The Board may adopt a corporate seal having inscribed thereon the
name of the Corporation, the year of its organization and the words "Corporate
Seal, Delaware".  The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to
be impressed, reproduced, or otherwise.

Section 6.  The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent authorized under the
laws of the State of Delaware, as those laws may be amended, indemnify any
director made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action or proceeding,
whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, by reason of being a
director of the Corporation or a predecessor corporation or, at the
Corporation's request, a director or officer of another corporation, provided,
however, that the Corporation shall indemnify any such agent in connection with
a proceeding initiated by such agent only if such proceeding was authorized by
the Board of the Corporation.  The indemnification provided for in this Section
6 shall: (i) not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those
indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement or vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in their official
capacities and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, (ii)
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, and (iii) inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.  The
Corporation's obligation to provide indemnification under this Section 6 shall
be offset to the extent of any other source of indemnification or any otherwise
applicable insurance coverage under a policy maintained by the Corporation or
any other person.  Expenses incurred by a director of the Corporation in
defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact
that he is or was a director of the Corporation (or was serving at the
Corporation's request as a director or officer of another corporation) shall be
paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit
or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director


                                                                               6

to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized by relevant sections
of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses to an agent who is a
party to an action, suit or proceeding brought by the Corporation and approved
by a majority of the Board of the Corporation which alleges willful
misappropriation of corporate assets by such agent, disclosure of confidential
information in violation of such agent's fiduciary or contractual obligations to
the Corporation or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such
agent's duty to the Corporation or its stockholders. The foregoing provisions of
this Section 6 shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each
director who serves in such capacity at any time while this bylaw is in effect,
and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any rights or
obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or theretofore
existing or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought
based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. The Board in its
discretion shall have power on behalf of the Corporation to indemnify any
person, other than a director, made a party to any action, suit or proceeding by
reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate, is or was an officer or
employee of the Corporation. To assure indemnification under this Section 6 of
all directors, officers and employees who are determined by the Corporation or
otherwise to be or to have been "fiduciaries" of any employee benefit plan of
the Corporation which may exist, Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware shall, for the purposes of this Section 6, be interpreted as follows:
an "other enterprise" shall be deemed to include such an employee benefit plan,
including without limitation, any plan of the Corporation which is governed by
the Act of Congress entitled "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,"
as amended; the Corporation shall be deemed to have requested a person to serve
an employee benefit plan where the performance by such person of his duties to
the Corporation also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such
person to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes
assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to such
Act of Congress shall be deemed "fines."

                           ARTICLE VIII -- AMENDMENTS

Section 1.  These bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed or new bylaws may
be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board, at any regular meeting of the
stockholders or of the Board or at any special meeting of the stockholders or of
the Board if notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new
bylaws be contained in the notice of such special meeting.  The power to adopt,
amend or repeal bylaws conferred upon the Board by the certificate of
incorporation shall not divest or limit the power of the stockholders to adopt,
amend or repeal bylaws.
