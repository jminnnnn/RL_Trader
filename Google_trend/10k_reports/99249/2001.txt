PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

Except for historical  information  contained herein,  the following  discussion
contains forward-looking  statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Such
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding
future events and the Company's  plans and  expectations.  The Company's  actual
results could differ materially from those discussed herein.  Factors that could
cause or contribute to such differences  include,  but are not limited to, those
discussed  below under  "Factors That May Affect  Future  Results," and "Forward
looking Statements", as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

General development of business.

Regency  Affiliates,  Inc.  (the  "Company" or  "Regency"  or the  "Registrant")
formerly  TransContinental  Energy  Corporation,  was  organized  as a  Delaware
corporation  in 1980 to be the  successor to  Transcontinental  Oil  Corporation
which existed since 1947.

Subsequent to a restructuring in 1992, the Company, on July 7, 1993, acquired an
80% interest in National Resource  Development  Corporation  ("NRDC") (the "NRDC
Transaction")  by the issuance of 2,975,000  shares of the Company's  $0.40 P.V.
Common Stock, 208,850 shares of the Company's cumulative $100 Series C Preferred
Stock and 20% of the outstanding  shares of  Transcontinental  Drilling  Company
("Drilling"),  a  subsidiary  of  the  Company  to  the  Statesman  Group,  Inc.
("Statesman"), an international business corporation organized under the laws of
the  Bahamas  (see Item 12).  NRDC's  principal  asset  consists  of  previously
quarried and stockpiled  Aggregate inventory located at a mine site in Michigan.
The Aggregate  inventory was pledged to secure  repayment of certain Zero Coupon
Bonds which have been issued by NRDC having a face value at maturity of $542,000
on January 1, 2002.  These Bonds were  retired in 1999  through the  issuance of
common stock of the Company.

On July 7,  1993,  Statesman  designated  eight  (8)  persons  to fill  existing
vacancies on the Board of Directors of the Company.  The appointments  were made
by the sole acting  director to fill the vacancies  until their  successors were
duly elected and qualified.

On November 18, 1994,  the Company  acquired a limited  partnership  interest in
Security  Land  and  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership  for  an  equity
investment  of $350,000.  The  Partnership  owns an office  building  complex in
Woodlawn,  Maryland,  which is  leased  to the  United  States  Social  Security
Administration.

On March 17, 1997,  the Company,  through Rustic Crafts  International,  Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary,  acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
Rustic  Crafts,  Co., Inc., a  manufacturer  of wood and cast marble  decorative
electric fireplaces and related  accessories.  Consideration for the acquisition
consisted of cash of $1,100,000,  assumption of certain liabilities, and 100,000
restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock.
<PAGE>

On April 22, 1999,  the Company  acquired  513,915 shares of the common stock of
Glas-Aire Industries Group, Ltd.  ("Glas-Aire") for the issuance of a promissory
note of  $650,000  due January 1, 2000,  at an interest  rate of 7.5% per annum,
which note was guaranteed by Mr. William Ponsoldt, Sr., President of the Company
and  $1,213,000 in cash.  Glas-Aire is a reporting  company,  and its shares are
listed on the Nasdaq small cap market under the symbol "GLAR" and on the Pacific
Exchange "GLA". The cash was obtained from an affiliate of Statesman through the
issuance of an unsecured demand note at the interest rate of 7.5% per annum. The
Company also purchased 3,000 shares of the common stock of Glas-Aire on the open
market.

On August 2, 1999,  the Company  acquired  41,600  shares of the common stock of
Glas-Aire  on the open  market  for  $119,619.  The funds  were  provided  by an
affiliate of Statesman on an unsecured basis.

On August 14, 1999,  the Company sold 2,852,375  shares of the Company's  common
stock to Glas-Aire for cash of $1,967,960 and 86,000 shares of Glas-Aire  common
stock for an total consideration of $2,281,900.

On September 23, 1999 the Company closed a common stock exchange  agreement with
certain  shareholders of Glas-Aire.  Under the agreement,  Regency, in a private
transaction,  issued  1,188,000  shares of its  restricted  common stock to such
shareholders  in  exchange  for  288,000  Glas-Aire  common  shares  held by the
shareholders. With the closing of the agreement, the Company owned approximately
51.3% of the currently then outstanding common shares of Glas-Aire.  At December
31, 2000 the Company owned 50.1% of the outstanding common shares of Glas-Aire.

At the  Glas-Aire  annual  shareholders'  meeting on November  4, 1999,  William
Ponsoldt, Sr. and Marc Baldinger,  directors of the Company, were elected to the
Glas-Aire  board of directors.  The Company also proposed two other nominees who
were elected to the six-member board of Glas-Aire.

At the December 3, 2000 board of directors  meeting,  Mr. Horbach and Mr. Graham
resigned their positions as directors of Regency. At the same meeting, the board
of  directors  elected to close the Omaha,  Nebraska  office and  terminate  the
employment  of Mr.  Horbach  and  Mrs.  Antosh  as  interim  CFO and  Secretary,
respectively.

Narrative description of business.


NATIONAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION

NRDC  has as its  principal  asset  approximately  70 +  million  short  tons of
previously quarried and stockpiled rock ("Aggregate") located at the site of the
Groveland Mine in Dickinson  County,  Michigan.  Aggregate is primarily sold for
railroad  ballast,  road  construction,   construction  along  shore  lines  and
decorative  uses. The market for Aggregate stone is highly  competitive  and, as
shipping  costs are high, the majority of sales,  if any, are  anticipated to be
made  locally.  Other  companies  that produce rock and  Aggregate  products are
located in the same region as the Groveland Mine.  Many of the competitors  have
greater  financial and personnel  resources than the Company.  As a consequence,
there can be no  assurance  that  acting  alone NRDC will be able to  consummate
sales of material amounts of its Aggregate.

On March 1, 1999, the Company and Cotton Valley Resources  Corporation  ("Cotton
Valley")  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger  Agreement")
which provided that Cotton Valley would exchange 15 million of its common shares
for the  Company's  interest  in NRDC and 10 million  of its  common  shares for
Statesman's interest in NRDC and Statesman's interest in International Aggregate
Company.  The Merger  Agreement was contingent upon several matters dealing with
Cotton Valley which Cotton  Valley was not able to meet.  The Plan of Merger was
not  consummated.  The  Company  continues  to  have  discussions  with  several
companies regarding the possible sale of its interest in NRDC. To facilitate the
discussions  concerning a possible  sale,  the zero coupon bonds (secured by the
Aggregate  inventory) which had been issued by NRDC were retired by the issuance
in 1999 of 121,000 shares of the Company's common stock.

Following the termination of the Plan of Merger,  the Company  installed limited
Aggregate crushing and marketing operations during 1999 at the Groveland Mine in
an informal joint venture with another company. The Company continues to explore
the possibility of establishing a permanent  infrastructure to commercialize the
inventory of previously quarried and stockpiled  Aggregate at the Groveland Mine
or alternative means of monetizing the asset.


SECURITY LAND AND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

On November 18, 1994, Regency  Affiliates,  Inc. acquired a limited  partnership
interest in Security  Land And  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership  (the
"Partnership")  for an equity investment of $350,000.  Regency has no obligation
to make any further  capital  contribution to the  Partnership.  The Partnership
owns the 34.3 acre Security West complex at 1500 Woodlawn  Drive,  Woodlawn,  MD
consisting of a two-story office building and a connected six-story office tower
occupied  by  the  United  States  Social  Security   Administration  Office  of
Disability and International Operations under a nine year lease expiring October
31, 2003 (the "Lease").  The buildings have a net rentable area of approximately
717,000  square feet.  The  construction  of the  Security  West  Buildings  was
completed  in 1972 and the  building  has been  occupied by the Social  Security
Administration since 1972 under prior leases between the U.S. Government and the
Partnership.

<PAGE>

During  1994,  the   Partnership   completed  the  placement  of  a  $56,450,000
non-recourse  project note,  due November 15, 2003. The placement of the project
note was undertaken by the issuance of 7.90%  certificates of participation  and
was  underwritten by Dillon Read & Co., Inc. The net proceeds  received from the
sale of the certificates were used to refinance existing debt of the Partnership
related to the project,  to finance  certain  alterations  to the project by the
Partnership,  to fund  certain  reserves  and to pay costs of the  project  note
issue.  The project note is a non-recourse  obligation of the Partnership and is
payable  solely from the Lease  payments from the U.S.  Government.  Such rental
payments under the Lease are not subject to annual  appropriation  by the United
States  Congress and  accordingly,  the  obligations  to make such  payments are
unconditional general obligations of the Government backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States.  The payments under the Lease consist of base rent,
maintenance  rent,  additional base rent,  additional  maintenance  rent and the
government  tax  reimbursement  amount.  The  base  rent,  maintenance  rent and
additional  base rent are fixed amounts and are not subject to  adjustment.  The
base rent and the  additional  base rent together  constitute  the finance rent,
which will be  utilized to pay  principal  and  interest  on the  project  note,
certain real estate taxes and costs of insurance and other reserves.

The terms of the  Security  Land And  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership
Agreement (as amended) and the project note (which note will be fully  amortized
over the term of the lease) call for Regency  Affiliates,  Inc. to be  allocated
95% of the profits and losses of the Partnership until October 31, 2003, and 50%
thereafter.  The investment in Security is estimated to provide the Company with
management  fees of  approximately  $100,000  per annum until 2003.  In the year
ending December 31, 2000, the Company's income from its equity investment in the
Partnership was $4,712,615.  These funds,  however,  are presently committed for
the amortization of the outstanding  principal balance on Security's real estate
mortgage and, while the Company's equity investment has increased to $24,565,884
the  partnership  does not  provide  cash flow to the  Company  in excess of the
$100,000  annual  management  fee. The  partnership  agreement  provides for the
distribution of "Sale or Refinancing  Proceeds" in accordance with the partner's
positive tax capital  account  balances.  At December 31, 1998,  Regency was the
only partner with a positive tax capital account balance.

On November 30, 2000, The Company invested $10,000 for a 5% Limited  Partnership
Interest in 1500 Woodlawn Limited Partnership,  the General Partner of Security.
Additional information regarding this transaction may be found in Exhibit 31.


RUSTIC CRAFTS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Rustic Crafts International,  Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is
a manufacturer of decorative wood and cast marble fireplaces,  mantels, shelves,
fireplace  accessories  and  other  home  furnishings.   Rustic  Crafts  employs
approximately 40 persons.


<PAGE>

In 2000 and 1999 Rustic Crafts generated net sales of  approximately  $3,389,977
and  $3,875,263  respectively.  Its largest  customer,  J.C.  Penney  Co.,  Inc.
represents  approximately  38% and 60% of the sales of Rustic Crafts in 2000 and
1999, respectively. Approximately 68% of the sales of Rustic Crafts occur in the
fourth quarter of the calendar year. As of December 31, 2000,  Rustic Crafts had
approximately $225,000 of open orders.  Although orders are generally subject to
termination,  the Company has historically  experienced minimal  cancellation of
orders.

Rustic Crafts purchases the raw materials used in its manufacturing process from
several  suppliers.  The Company  believes  that there is minimal  risk from any
termination of suppliers and that there are several suppliers who are capable of
supplying similar quality products at competitive prices.

Rustic  Crafts has a number of  competitors  for its  products,  and  management
considers the business to be competitive.


GLAS-AIRE INDUSTRIES GROUP, LTD.


Glas-Aire  Industries Group,  LTD.(Glas-Aire),  a publicly traded company,  is a
subsidiary of the Company. Glas-Aire designs,  develops,  manufactures and sells
sunroof  deflectors,  hood  protectors and rear air  deflectors for cars,  light
trucks and vans. It uses plastics and thermoforming  technology to produce these
products.  Glas-Aire's  products are used in the diverse and growing  automotive
components  market,  comprised of  after-market  accessories,  dealer  installed
accessories, car care products and other products purchased by consumers for the
purpose  of  improving  their  vehicles  (versus  those  purchased  for  routine
maintenance).  Glas-Aire  participates  in the  OEM  segment  of the  appearance
accessory market,  providing products to the automotive manufacturers which then
distribute the products to consumers  through their dealer networks.  During the
year ending December 31, 2000, approximately 98% of its sales were to automobile
manufacturers. Glas-Aire employs approximately 208 persons.

Glas-Aire generated net sales of $10,929,775 for the eleven months period ending
December 31, 2000.  Net income before  income taxes and equity  earnings for the
eleven months ending December 31, 2000 was $849,619. Glas-Aire has been included
in the Company's consolidated financial statements effective September 23, 1999,
the date that the Company acquired 51.3% control of Glas-Aire.

Glas-Aire sells  principally to automobile  manufacturers  in the United States,
Canada,  Japan and the United Kingdom.  For the eleven months ended December 31,
2000, sales in the US accounted for 84% of Glas-Aire's sales, and 12% in Canada.
Three major customers  accounted for  approximately 79% of Glas-Aire's sales for
the eleven months ending December 31, 2000.

Glas-Aire has several  competitors which have  substantially  greater technical,
financial and marketing  resources,  and management considers the business to be
competitive.

Acrylic is the single most  expensive  raw  material  used in the  manufacturing
process.  Glas-Aire normally purchases its acrylic from one or two suppliers. If
Glas-Aire  were to lose either of these  suppliers  management is confident that
other  suppliers  can be found,  although  the  number of acrylic  suppliers  is
limited.

As of December 31, 2000, Regency and its subsidiaries employed approximately 249
people.


ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES


Reference is made to Item 1, Business,  page 5 of this report, for a description
of the  Security  West  Building at 1500  Woodlawn  Drive,  Woodlawn,  MD, which
property is owned by Security Land And Development Company Limited Partnership.

Rustic Crafts  International,  Inc. conducted its manufacturing  operations in a
multistory leased facility located at 315 Cherry Street, Scranton,  Pennsylvania
and in a  second  leased  facility  located  at  305  Cherry  Street,  Scranton,
Pennsylvania  until  early  1999.  Both  premises  were  occupied  pursuant to a
sublease which was  terminated.  In March 1998, the Company  purchased a 126,000
square foot building located at 40 Poplar Street in Scranton,  Pennsylvania. The
Company  renovated the building and began to occupy the space during early 1999.
Approximately 51,000 square feet in this building are leased to other tenants.

As of December 31, 2000, NRDC owned 70 + million short tons of Aggregate located
at the site of the Groveland Mine in Dickinson County,  Michigan.  The Groveland
Mine is an iron ore  mine  that was  shut  down in 1981 by a  former  owner  and
operator,  M.A. Hanna Company. The mine was acquired by International  Aggregate
Corporation in December,  1989. International Aggregate Corporation subsequently
transferred title to the Aggregate to National Resource Development  Corporation
(Delaware),  NRDC's  predecessor.  The 70 + million  short tons of  Aggregate is
commingled with other Aggregate not owned by NRDC and is rock that was separated
from iron ore during previous mining operations.  The ownership of the Aggregate
is subject to a Royalty  Agreement  between North  American  Demolition  Company
(International  Aggregate  Corporation's  predecessor  in title) and M.A.  Hanna
Company  dated  December 22,  1989,  as amended,  which  requires the payment of
certain royalties to M.A. Hanna Company upon sales of Aggregate.

Glas-Aire conducts its operations in approximately  25,000 square feet of leased
space located at 3137 Grandview  Highway,  Vancouver,  British Columbia,  Canada
under a lease due to expire  2003 with an option for an  additional  five years.
Glas-Aire also rents on a month-to-month  basis,  5,000 square feet of warehouse
space in Bellingham, Washington. These facilities are adequate for the Company's
present  level of business and  anticipated  growth over the next two years.  If
sales grow  significantly  greater than is anticipated,  management  believes it
will require additional manufacturing space.

The Company owned a one-story  commercial  building located on a one-eighth acre
parcel of land located in Stuart,  Florida which was leased to a single  tenant.
The Company also owned a condominium in Jensen Beach, Florida.  These properties
were sold in March 1999 at approximately their original purchase price.


<PAGE>

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


As of  December  31,  2000  and the  date of this  report  there  were no  legal
proceedings involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries.


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS


No matters  were  submitted to the vote of security  holders  during the quarter
ending December 31, 2000.

Dividend policy.

The Company has not paid or declared  cash  dividends on its Common Stock during
the last two fiscal  years.  The  Company has no present  intention  to pay cash
dividends on its Common Stock in the future.

In  early  1990,   Continental   Illinois  National  Bank  &  Trust  of  Chicago
("Continental")  resigned as the Company's  registrar and transfer agent because
of the  Company's  inability  to pay  Continental  for services  performed.  The
records were  forwarded to Mr.  Horbach of Horbach & Associates  who  contracted
with Regency to act as transfer agent.

In January 2001,  Transfer On-Line was named as transfer agent replacing Horbach
&  Associates.  Transfer  On-Line  is  located  at 227 Pine  Street,  Suite 300,
Portland,  Oregon  97204.  Their  telephone  number is (503)  227-2950 and their

In 2000, the Company issued (a) 99,293 Common shares for  professional  services
rendered,  (b) 114,000  Common Shares to a  shareholder  pursuant to an exchange
agreement, (c) 95,877 Common Shares in conjunction with the Series E conversion,
and (d) 47,961  Common  shares  issued to directors as  compensation.  The above
listed  issuance  was  exempt  from  registration  under  section  4(2)  of  the
Securities Act.

In 1999, the Company issued (a) 10,828 Common Shares in exchange for 88.5 shares
of the Company's  Series E Preferred  Stock, (b) 121,000 Common Shares to retire
the zero coupon  debentures  issued by NRDC, (c) 77,746 Common Shares in payment
of obligations including 47,736 shares issued to directors as compensation,  and
(d) 4,040,375 Common Shares in connection with the acquisition of Glas-Aire. The
common  shares  issued in connection  with the  Glas-Aire  transactions  are not
considered to be outstanding and are reported as Treasury Stock.

In 1998,  the Company  issued  187,000  shares of its Common Stock to William R.
Ponsoldt,  Sr. as part of his  compensation.  Also, in 1998,  the Company issued
10,000  shares of its Common Stock to two  employees of Rustic Crafts as part of
their compensation.

In March 1997,  the Company issued 100,000 shares of its Common Stock at a value
of $60,000 to Rustic Crafts Co., Inc., as part of the sale of that corporation's
business to Rustic  Crafts  International,  Inc.  The  Company  received no cash
consideration for the issuance of these shares.

Effective  June 3, 1997,  the Company issued 466,667 shares of Common Stock at a
value of $233,333 and options to purchase an  additional  6.1 million  shares of
Common  Stock to Statesman  Group,  Inc. The options were issued to Statesman in
order to  secure  the  release  of Mr.  William  R.  Ponsoldt,  Sr.  to serve as
President and Chief  Executive  Officer of the Company and to recognize in part,
the amendment to the Series C Preferred  Shares under which Statesman  forfeited
the common stock conversion  rights with respect thereto.  Statesman also agreed
to provide loan guarantees not to exceed the sum of $300,000 upon the request of
the Company and a showing of reasonable need. The Company has recently  accessed
the Statesman  loan.  The loan is a demand loan which is  collateralized  by the
Glas-Aire Stock held by the Company.  Statesman and/or its affiliated  interests
have provided loan guarantees  and/or unsecured prime interest rate direct loans
to the Company in excess of $2,000,000 since June 1997.  Pursuant to the Amended
and Restated  Agreement  between the Company and Statesman,  until their date of
expiration,  the  options are  exercisable  at any time in whole or in part at a
price  equal to the lower of (a) the closing  trading  price of the shares as of
the most recent date on which at least 10,000  shares of such stock were traded,
or (b) the average  closing  trading  price of the shares  during the ninety day
period immediately preceding the date of exercise. The Company agreed to reserve
sufficient  shares to meet the  requirements  of the  options.  The  options are
exercisable  immediately  and remain  exercisable  until April 15, 2007.  At the
option of  Statesman,  payment  may be made by  Statesman  for  exercise  of the
options,  in whole or in part,  in the form of a  promissory  note  executed  by
Statesman,  secured  only by a pledge of the  shares  purchased,  with  interest
accruing for any quarter at the prime rate,  and interest and principal  payable
in a balloon payment five years after the date of the note, provided that if the
Company's Board of Directors  reasonably  determines that exercising the options
by delivery  of a note would  render the  respective  purchase of shares void or
voidable, then the Board may require, as a condition to exercise of the options,
that Statesman either (i) pay at least the par value of the shares in cash (with
the balance paid by delivery of a note), or (ii) provide  acceptable  collateral
other than the shares  themselves to secure payment of the note. The Company has
determined that these options have no readily determinable fair value consistent
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123.  Therefore,  the Company has not recognized
any cost  associated  with the issuance of these  options,  and net earnings per
share for 1997 do not reflect  any such  costs.  Statesman  has  recently  given
notice to the Company of it's intention to exercise the options.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
        OPERATIONS.


General

Regency  Affiliates,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is the  parent  company of several
subsidiary  business  operations.  The Company is  committed  to develop  and/or
monetize  these  business  operations  for the benefit of its  shareholders  and
continues to commit both  financial and personnel  resources to an active merger
and acquisition  program in order to enhance common  shareholders'  values.  The
Company's  Shareholders' Equity at December 31, 2000 was $16,076,052 as compared
to $13,636,050 on December 31, 1999, an increase of 17.9%.


Liquidity and Capital Resources.

The  investment in Security is estimated to provide the Company with  management
fees of approximately  $100,000 per annum until 2003. In the year ended December
31, 2000, the Company's income from its equity investment in the Partnership was
$4,712,615.  These funds,  however, are presently committed for the amortization
of the  outstanding  principal  balance on Security's  real estate mortgage and,
while  the  Company's  equity   investment  has  increased  to  $24,575,881  the
partnership does not provide  liquidity to the Company in excess of the $100,000
annual management fee. The partnership  agreement  provides for the distribution
of "Sale or Refinancing  Proceeds" in accordance with the partner's positive tax
capital  account  balances.  At December 31, 1999,  Regency was the only partner
with a positive tax capital  account  balance.  The Company has been  previously
successful in obtaining  financing with respect to this partnership  interest to
fund its acquisition program and cash flow deficits.

On March 15, 1998,  Rustic  Crafts  purchased a building of 126,000  square feet
located  near the current  facility in Scranton,  Pennsylvania.  The purchase of
this facility was funded by new borrowings  from PNC Bank in the form of a first
mortgage  term loan in the  amount of  $960,000.  Rustic  Crafts  also  obtained
financing of approximately  $923,000 from the PNC Bank to equip the facility and
purchase new  equipment.  The move to the new facility was completed in 1999 and
has significantly  increased the operating capacity and enabled Rustic Crafts to
more  efficiently meet its current order backlog and increase its customer base.
On the date of  acquisition  of the new  facility,  a tenant was renting  23,000
square  feet  of this  facility  at a base  rent of  $17,400  per  year  plus an
allocable  share of the real  estate  taxes.  The tenant was removed in 2001 for
failure to pay rent.  The Company is currently  negotiating  with the tenant for
payment of back rent.  The Company has the space  listed for with an agent for a
replacement.

The Company has had discussions  with several  companies  regarding the possible
sale of its  interest  in NRDC.  To  facilitate  the  discussions  concerning  a
possible sale, the NRDC zero coupon bonds (secured by the Aggregate  inventory),
were retired in 1999 by the issuance of 121,000  shares of the Company's  common
stock.  Following  the  termination  of the 1999 NRDC Plan of Merger with Cotton
Valley Resources  Corporation,  the Company installed limited Aggregate crushing
and marketing operations at the Groveland Mine in an informal joint venture with
another  company.  Pending  the  outcome of current  discussions  regarding  the
possible  sale of the  Company's  interest,  the Company is also  exploring  the
possibility of establishing a permanent  infrastructure  during the year 2001 to
commercialize the inventory of previously  quarried and stockpiled  Aggregate at
the Groveland Mine in cooperation with an experienced Aggregate supply company.

On April 22, 1999, the Company  acquired 513,915 shares (35%) of the outstanding
common stock of Glas-Aire for the issuance of a promissory  note of $650,000 due
January 1, 2000, at an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, which note is guaranteed
by Mr. William Ponsoldt,  Sr.,  President of the Company and $1,213,000 in cash.
As of  September  23, 1999  Regency had  acquired  51.3% of the common  stock of
Glas-Aire.  These  common  stock  acquisitions  were  effected  by  open  market
purchases,  with  the  funding  provided  by an  affiliate  of  Statesman  on an
unsecured  basis,  by direct  purchases  from  Glas-Aire,  and by a common stock
exchange  agreement  between the Company and certain  shareholders of Glas-Aire.
Under the common stock exchange  agreement,  the Company issued 1,188,000 shares
of its restricted  common stock in exchange for 288,000  Glas-Aire common shares
held by the shareholders.

The Company also sold 2,852,375 shares of its common stock to Glas-Aire for cash
of  $1,967,960  and 86,000 shares of Glas-Aire  common stock.  The proceeds were
used to repay the  funding  provided  by an  affiliate  of  Statesman  and other
general corporate requirements.

<PAGE>

The Company is continuing to explore  opportunities  to acquire  companies  with
operations  that will provide  additional  liquidity  and cash flow. In February
2000,  the  Company  executed  Letters  of  Intent  to  acquire  55%  of  Knight
Enterprises, Inc. a provider of various high speed digital access to major cable
companies  throughout  Florida;  100% of Southwest  Mill and Lumber  Company,  a
California  based  producer of picture  frame  molding  and frames;  and 100% of
Valley  Wholesale  Supply Corp., a California based marketer of picture molding,
framing  supplies and equipment.  Negotiations  with Knight  Enterprises,  Inc.,
Southwest Mill and Lumber Company,  and Valley  Wholesale Supply Corp. have been
discontinued.  The Company  expects the Letters of Intent referred to above will
be formally terminated  shortly.  The Company's ability to continue in existence
is partly dependent upon its ability to attain  satisfactory levels of operating
cash flows and it's ability to continue borrowing.

Results of Operations

In  September  1999,  the Company  acquired a 51%  interest in  Glas-Aire  which
manufactures automotive accessories sold primarily to automotive  manufacturers.
The  financial  statements  for 1999  include  the  results of  Glas-Aire  since
September 1999, and the operations of Rustic Crafts acquired in 1997.


2000 Compared to 1999

Net sales increased  $6,507,542  over 1999, an 83% increase.  Net sales includes
$10,929,775  of Glas-Aire  sales.  Sales of household  accessories  decreased by
$485,286 due to general economic conditions  resulting in a decline in sales and
a reduction in backlog orders from the previous period.  Rustic Crafts continues
to  emphasized  higher  margin  sales in 2000 and to reduce its reliance on it's
single large customer, who requires discounted prices.

Gross  margins  increased  $2,050,695  in 2000  over  1999,  which is  primarily
attributable to the acquisition of Glas-Aire and it's inclusion in the companies
financial  statements  for the entire year.  Gross  margins of home  accessories
increased  $196,200 in 2000  reflecting  the  Company's  focus on higher  margin
products.

Selling and administrative expenses increased $1,960,385 or 58% in 2000 compared
to 1999 The increase is attributable to the inclusion in the companies financial
statement of Glas-Aire  activities  for the entire year.  Expenses  increased at
Rustic Crafts by $214,842 as a result of higher costs of selling and  marketing,
including the compensation of key employees.

Income from equity investment in partnership increased $415,303 over 1999 due to
the reduction of interest  expenses on the lower loan  principal  balance of the
partnership,   partially  offset  by  increased   operating  and  administrative
expenses.

Other income decreased $91,085 in 2000 as compared to 1999. Other income in 1999
includes  $114,960 of equity  earnings  related to the  Company's  ownership  in
Glas-Aire  prior to  September  1999.  These  earnings  were offset by decreased
interest income from declining invested cash balances.

Interest expense  decreased  $12,421 in 2000 from 1999 as a result of lower cost
of funds.  Interest expense in 1998 included  significant costs and penalties in
connection  with the  refinancing of the SIPI loan in June 1998. The elimination
of the refinancing  costs was partially offset by additional loans for equipment
and  facilities  at Rustic  Crafts and the higher  loan  balance of the KBC loan
which refinanced the SIPI loan.

Income tax expense  increased  $190,984 due to income tax expense for Glas-Aire.
The Company cannot use its net operating loss to offset the earnings of this 51%
owned subsidiary.

Minority interest in the Statement of Operations increased $79,128 due primarily
to the  inclusion of the results of operations of Glas-Aire for the full year of
2000.

Net income  decreased  $137,668 or 6% in 2000 over 1999. The decrease was due to
the recognition of an extraordinary  gain in 1999.  Income before  extraordinary
gain increased $192,197 or 9.8% in 2000 over 1999.

1999 Compared to 1998

Net sales increased  $4,045,232  over 1998, a 107% increase.  Net sales includes
$3,930,541 of Glas-Aire sales. Sales of household accessories increased $158,039
due to increased  advertising  and marketing  efforts at Rustic  Crafts.  Rustic
Crafts emphasized higher margin sales in 1999 in order to reduce its reliance on
a single large customer who required discounted prices.

Gross margins  increased  $1,323,043  in 1999 over 1998, of which  $1,168,970 is
attributable to the acquisition of Glas-Aire.  Gross margins of home accessories
increased  $196,200 in 1999  reflecting  the  Company's  focus on higher  margin
products and new, lower discount  customers.  Rustic Crafts reduced its reliance
on its single  largest  customer  from 54% of its total  sales in 1998 to 39% in
1999.

General and administrative expenses increased $1,352,795 or 66% in 1999 compared
to 1998. Administrative expenses of $773,943 are attributable to the acquisition
of  Glas-Aire.  Expenses  increased at Rustic  Crafts due to increased  costs of
selling and marketing  including the development and printing of new promotional
materials.  Corporate  administrative  expenses increased due to higher salaries
and bonuses as a result of higher  profits;  higher  consulting  fees and travel
related expenses for continued  acquisition  efforts and the related  financing;
and board compensation paid in accordance with the compensation  program adopted
by the shareholders in August.

Income from equity investment in partnership increased $311,122 over 1998 due to
the reduction of interest  expenses on the lower loan  principal  balance of the
partnership,   partially  offset  by  increased   operating  and  administrative
expenses.

Other income  increased  $49,740 in 1999 compared to 1998.  Other income in 1999
includes  $114,960 of equity  earnings  related to the  Company's  ownership  in
Glas-Aire  prior to  September  1999.  These  earnings  were offset by decreased
interest income from declining invested cash balances.

Gain on retirement of debt of $330,605 is due to the retirement of the NRDC zero
coupon bonds by the issuance of 121,000  shares of the  Company's  Common Stock.
Also,  a  significant  amount of the bonds were retired in  connection  with the
agreement of the Company to discontinue claims against one of the holders of the
bonds.

Interest expense decreased $128,349 in 1999 from 1998.  Interest expense in 1998
included  significant  costs and penalties in connection with the refinancing of
the SIPI  loan in June  1998.  The  elimination  of the  refinancing  costs  was
partially  offset by additional  loans for  equipment  and  facilities at Rustic
Crafts and the higher  loan  balance of the KBC loan which  refinanced  the SIPI
loan.

Income tax expense  increased  $136,726 due to income tax expense for Glas-Aire.
The Company cannot use its net operating loss to offset the earnings of this 51%
owned subsidiary.

Minority  interest  in  the  Statement  of  Operations  increased  $154,976  due
primarily to the  inclusion  of the results of  operations  of  Glas-Aire  since
September  1999,  and the  minority  interest  attributable  to the  gain on the
retirement of the NRDC zero coupon bonds.

Net income rose $498,362 or 27.8% in 1999 over 1998.  The increase was generally
due to the  increase in income  from equity in  partnership,  the  inclusion  of
Glas-Aire in consolidated  results of operations  since September 1999, the gain
on  retirement of debt and the reduction of interest  expense.  These  increases
were offset by increases in corporate  administrative expenses related primarily
to  higher  salaries  and  wages  and  costs  incurred  in  connection  with the
acquisition program.

Year 2000 Issues.

The Company had not anticipated any material  difficulties  associated with Year
2000 issues and none  materialized.  The Company  made no material  expenditures
associated  with Year 2000  issues  and had not  anticipated  that any  material
amounts would be expended in its earlier reports.

Forward-Looking Statements.

Certain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including,  but
not limited to, those  regarding  the  Company's  financial  position,  business
strategy,  acquisition  strategy  and other  plans  and  objectives  for  future
operations and any other  statements  that are not historical  facts  constitute
"forward-looking  statements"  expectations and beliefs concerning future events
impacting the Company and are subject to uncertainties  and factors  (including,
but not limited to, those  specified  below) which are difficult to predict and,
in many instances,  are beyond the control of the Company.  As a result,  actual
results of the Company may differ materially from those results  contemplated by
such forward-looking statements which include, but are not limited to:


          (i)  The Company currently does not generate positive cash flow as the
               current  activities of the Company do not, in and of  themselves,
               generate  sufficient  cash flow to cover its corporate  operating
               expenses and thus the Company  must rely on its cash  reserves to
               fund  these  expenses.  The  Company's  ability  to  continue  in
               existence  is  partly   dependent  upon  its  ability  to  attain
               satisfactory levels of operating cash flows.

          (ii) The Company  currently lacks the necessary infra structure at the
               site of the Groveland Mine in order to permit the Company to make
               more than casual sales of the Aggregate.

          (iii)An unsecured  default in the Lease or sudden  catastrophe  to the
               Security West Building  from  uninsured  acts of God or war could
               have a materially adverse impact upon the Company's investment in
               Security Land And  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership and
               therefore its financial position and results of operations.

          (iv) The failure of the Social  Security  Administration  to renew its
               lease of the  Security  West  Buildings  upon its  expiration  on
               October 31, 2003 could have an adverse  impact upon the Company's
               investment  in  Security  Land And  Development  Company  Limited
               Partnership.

          (v)  The Company has significant tax loss and credit carryforwards and
               no assurance  can be provided that the Internal  Revenue  Service
               would not attempt to limit or disallow  altogether  the Company's
               use,  retroactively and/or prospectively,  of such carryforwards,
               due to ownership changes or any other reason. The disallowance of
               the  utilization  of  the  Company's  net  operating  loss  would
               severely impact the Company's  financial  position and results of
               operations  due to the  significant  amounts  of  taxable  income
               (generated by the Company's  investment in Security)  that has in
               the past been, and is expected in the future to be, offset by the
               Company's net operating loss carryforwards.

          (vi) Both of the companies operating  subsidiaries  (Rustic Crafts and
               Glas-Aire)  are dependent on a limited  number of customers for a
               substantial portion of their respective revenues. The loss of one
               or more of these customers could have a significant effect on the
               Companies results of operations.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to  financial  market  risks due  primarily to changes in
interest  rates.  The Company  does not use  derivatives  to alter the  interest
characteristics  of  its  debt  securities.  The  Company  has  no  holdings  of
derivative or commodity  instruments  and does not transact  business in foreign
currencies  except for payments of salaries  and  expenses to certain  employees
located in foreign countries.

The fair value of the  Company's  cash and cash  equivalents  or related  income
would not be  significantly  impacted  by changes in  interest  rates  since the
investment  maturities  are  short.  Debt from draw downs on our lines of credit
incurs interest at the Prime Lending Rate which would change from time to time.

It is not  possible to  anticipate  the level of interest  rates going  forward.
Changes in interest rates have little impact as the majority of our debt is at a
fixed interest rate.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Regency Affiliates, Inc. and Subsidiaries

financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards  generally accepted

significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present

                          Independent Auditors' Report

Shareholders and Board of Directors
Regency Affiliates, Inc.
Stuart, Florida

         We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheet of Regency
Affiliates,  Inc. and  subsidiaries  as of December  31,  1999,  and the related
consolidated statements of operations,  shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the two years in the period ended  December 31,  1999.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

         We did not audit the 1999 and 1998  financial  statements  of  Security
Land and  Development  Company Limited  Partnership,  the investment in which is
reflected in the  accompanying  financial  statements using the equity method of
accounting.  The investment in this  partnership  represents 59% of consolidated
total  assets as of  December  31,  1999,  and 100% of the  income  from  equity
investment in partnership for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.  Those
financial  statements  were audited by other  auditors  whose  reports have been
furnished  to us,  and our  opinion,  insofar as it relates to the 1999 and 1998
amounts included for Security Land and Development Company Limited  Partnership,
is based solely on the reports of such other auditors.

         We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

         In our  opinion,  based  on our  audits  and the  report  of the  other
auditors,  the financial  statements  referred to above present  fairly,  in all
material respects,  the consolidated  financial position of Regency  Affiliates,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, and the  consolidated  results of
their  operations  and their  cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended  December 31, 1999 in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States.

         The disclosure  requirements  of Statement of Position 94-6 (SOP 94-6),
"Disclosure  of Certain Risks and  Uncertainties"  are included  throughout  the
notes to the Company's financial statements with an emphasis in Note 13.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

          A.   Principals  of  Consolidation   and  Nature  of  Business  -  The
               consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regency
               Affiliates,  Inc. (the "Company"), its wholly owned subsidiaries,
               Rustic  Crafts   International,   Inc.  ("Rustic  Crafts"),   and
               Speed.com,  Inc., its 80% owned  subsidiaries,  National Resource
               Development  Corporation  ("NRDC"),   Transcontinental   Drilling
               Company  ("Drilling")  and RegTransco,  Inc.  ("RTI") and its 50%
               owned subsidiary,  Glas-Aire Industries Group, Ltd. ("Glas-Aire")
               since September 23, 1999, the date in which the Company  achieved
               an  ownership   interest   greater  than  50%.  All   significant
               intercompany  balances and  transactions  have been eliminated in
               consolidation.

               Regency Affiliates,  Inc.'s  (Registrant's) share of consolidated
               net assets at December 31, 2000 and 1999 consists  principally of
               cash  and  cash   equivalents   of   approximately   $12,000  and
               $1,442,000,   respectively,   investment   in   partnerships   of
               approximately   $24,576,000   and   $19,959,000,    respectively,
               property,  plant  and  equipment  of  approximately  $27,300  and
               $12,000,   respectively,   and   liabilities   of   approximately
               $12,303,000 and $11,578,000, respectively.

          B.   Revenue  Recognition  -  The  Company's   subsidiaries  recognize
               revenue from the sale of goods upon shipment to their  respective
               customers.

          C.   Earnings  Per Share - Basic  earnings  per share are  computed by
               dividing  net income  attributable  to common  shareholders  (net
               income less preferred  stock dividend  requirements  and periodic
               accretion if applicable) by the weighted average number of common
               shares  outstanding  during the year.  Diluted earnings per share
               computations  assume the  conversion  of Series E,  Series B, and
               Junior  Series D  preferred  stock  during  the  period  that the
               preferred stock issues were  outstanding.  If the result of these
               assumed  conversions is dilutive,  the dividend  requirements and
               periodic  accretion  for the  preferred  stock issues are reduced
               (See Note 8).

               The weighted  average number of shares used in basic earnings per
               share  computations  for  2000,  1999 and 1998 was  approximately
               13,085,106  and  12,664,000  and  12,546,000,  respectively.  The
               weighted  average  number of shares  used in the  computation  of
               diluted   earnings  per  share  for  2000,   1999  and  1998  was
               approximately    14,864,004,     14,923,000    and    14,892,000,
               respectively.  The shares of the Company  held by  Glas-Aire  are
               treated as treasury  shares for earnings per share  computations.
               The  Company's  stock was thinly  traded in the  over-the-counter
               market on the bulletin  board  section  until late 1999. In 1999,
               1998 and 1997, market prices of $.587, $.984 and $.547 per share,
               respectively,  were utilized in the  conversion  formulas for the
               computation  of diluted  earnings  per share.  In 2000,  1999 and
               1998, if market prices of $.406,  $.563 per share,  and $.437 per
               share, respectively, the lowest bid price of the Company's common
               shares during the year, were used in the conversion formulas, the
               weighted  average number of shares utilized in the computation of
               diluted   earnings  per  share  would  amount  to   approximately
               15,061,106,  15,435,000 and  15,169,000,  respectively,  yielding
               diluted earnings per share of $.14, $.15 and $.12, respectively.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

           C.  Earnings Per Share (Continued)

               Earnings per common share attributable to extraordinary gain (net
               of tax) for 1999 are:  Earnings  per common share - basic of $.03
               and earning per common share - diluted of $.02.

          D.   Fair Value of  Financial  Instruments  - The fair values of cash,
               accounts  receivable,   accounts  payable  and  other  short-term
               obligations  approximate  their  carrying  values  because of the
               short  maturity  of these  financial  instruments.  The  carrying
               values of the Company's long-term  obligations  approximate their
               fair value. In accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting
               Standards  No.  107,  "Disclosure  About Fair Value of  Financial
               Instruments,"  rates  available  at  balance  sheet  dates to the
               Company are used to estimate the fair value of existing debt.

          E.   Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash  equivalents  represent
               cash and  short-term  highly  liquid  investments  with  original
               maturities of three months or less.  The Company  places its cash
               and  cash   equivalents   with  high  credit  quality   financial
               institutions which may exceed federally insured amounts at times.

          F.   Inventory - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
               using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Market value for raw
               materials is defined as replacement cost and for work-in-progress
               and  finished  products as net  realizable  value.  Inventory  is
               comprised of the following at December 31, 2000 and 1999:

                                               2000            1999

                                         ==============  =============

          G.   Property, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment are
               carried at cost.  Depreciation  is  provided  over the  estimated
               useful  lives of the assets by the use of the  straight-line  and
               declining  balance methods.  These items consist of the following
               at December 31, 2000 and 1999:

                                                   Property, Plant and

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Note 1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

           H.  Aggregate  Inventory - Inventory,  which  consists of 70+ million
               short tons of previously  quarried and stockpiled  aggregate rock
               located at the site of the  Groveland  Mine in Dickinson  County,
               Michigan,  is stated at lower of cost or market.  The  Company is
               also subject to a royalty agreement which requires the payment of
               certain royalties to a previous owner of the aggregate  inventory
               upon sale of the aggregate.

               During the years ended  December  31,  2000,  1999 and 1998,  the
               Company  made  only  casual  sales  of  aggregate.  Aggregate  is
               primarily   sold  for  railroad   ballast,   road   construction,
               construction  along shore lines and  decorative  uses. The market
               for aggregate stone is highly  competitive and, as shipping costs
               are high, the majority of sales, if any, can be anticipated to be
               made  locally.  Other  companies  that produce rock and aggregate
               products  are located in the same region as the  Groveland  Mine.
               Many of these  competitors  have greater  financial and personnel
               resources than the Company.

               The Company  continues to have discussions with several companies
               regarding   the  possible  sale  of  its  interest  in  NRDC.  To
               facilitate the  discussions  concerning a possible sale, the zero
               coupon bonds (secured by the aggregate  inventory) which had been
               issued by NRDC were  retired in 1999 by the  issuance  of 121,000
               shares of the Company's common stock.

               The  Company  has  installed  limited   aggregate   crushing  and
               marketing  operations at the Groveland  Mine in an informal joint
               venture  with  another  company.  Pending  the outcome of current
               discussions   regarding   the  possible  sale  of  the  Company's
               interest,   the  Company  is   exploring   the   possibility   of
               establishing a permanent  infrastructure  during the year 2001 to
               commercialize the inventory of previously quarried and stockpiled
               aggregate  at  the  Groveland   Mine  in   cooperation   with  an
               experienced aggregate supply company.

          I.   Goodwill  -  Goodwill  resulted  from the  acquisition  of Rustic
               Crafts  in 1997 and  Glas-Aire  in 1999.  The  goodwill  is being
               amortized  straight-line  over a period of 15 years.  Accumulated
               amortization  was  $208,623 and $135,946 at December 31, 2000 and
               1999, respectively.

          J.   Debt Issuance  Costs - Debt  issuance  costs are recorded at cost
               and are being  amortized over 66 months,  the life of the related
               loan   using   the   effective   interest   method.   Accumulated
               amortization  was  $398,329 and $239,179 at December 31, 2000 and
               1999, respectively.

          K.   Income  Taxes  - The  Company  utilizes  Statement  of  Financial
               Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting for Income
               Taxes,"  which  requires  an  asset  and  liability  approach  to
               financial   accounting  and  reporting  for  income  taxes.   The
               difference  between  the  financial  statement  and tax  basis of
               assets and  liabilities is determined  annually.  Deferred income
               tax assets  and  liabilities  are  computed  for those  temporary
               differences that have future tax  consequences  using the current
               enacted  tax laws and rates  that  apply to the  periods in which
               they are expected to affect taxable  income.  In some  situations
               SFAS  109  permits  the  recognition  of  expected   benefits  of
               utilizing  net  operating  loss  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.
               Valuation  allowances  are  established  based upon  management's
               estimate,  if  necessary.  Income tax  expense is the current tax
               payable  or  refundable  for the  period  plus or  minus  the net
               exchange in the deferred tax assets and liabilities.

          L.   Foreign Currency Translation - Glas-Aire's functional currency is
               the Canadian  dollar and its operations have been translated into
               the  U.  S.  dollar  using  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting
               Standards No. 52.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

          M.   Use of Estimates - The  preparation  of financial  statements  in
               conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
               management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the
               reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
               contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
               statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and  expenses
               during the  reporting  period.  Actual  results could differ from
               those estimates.

          N.   Reclassifications - Certain  reclassifications were made to prior
               period financial statement  presentations to conform with current
               period presentations.

Note 2.   Investment in Glas-Aire

          On April 22, 1999, the Company,  through its  wholly-owned  subsidiary
          Speed.com,  Inc.,  acquired  513,915  shares  of the  common  stock of
          Glas-Aire  in  exchange  for  the  issuance  of a  promissory  note of
          $650,000 due January 1, 2000,  at an interest  rate of 7.5% per annum,
          which note was  guaranteed  by Mr.  Ponsoldt,  Sr.,  President  of the
          Company  and  $1,213,000  in  cash.  The  cash  was  obtained  from an
          affiliate of a shareholder through the issuance of an unsecured demand
          note at 7.5% per annum. The Company also purchased 3,000 shares of the
          common stock of Glas-Aire on the open market.  On August 2, 1999,  the
          Company acquired 41,600 shares of the common stock of Glas-Aire on the
          open market for $119,619. The funds were provided by an affiliate of a
          shareholder  on an unsecured  basis.  On August 14, 1999,  the Company
          sold  2,852,375  shares of its common stock to  Glas-Aire  for cash of
          $1,967,960  and  86,000  shares  of  Glas-Aire  common  stock  for  an
          aggregate  consideration  of  $2,281,900.  On September 23, 1999,  the
          Company  closed  a  common  stock  exchange   agreement  with  certain
          shareholders  of Glas-Aire.  Under the  agreement,  the Company,  in a
          private transaction,  issued 1,188,000 shares of its restricted common
          stock to such shareholders in exchange for 288,000 newly issued shares
          of Glas-Aire  stock.  On May 17, 2000 the Company also issued  114,000
          shares of it's  restricted  common stock as  additional  consideration
          pursuant to the common stock exchange agreement.

          With the closing of the agreement, the Company owned 51.3% of the then
          outstanding common shares of Glas-Aire.  Through December 31, 2000 the
          Company has  increased  the number of common  shares of  Glas-Aire  to
          1,220,123  by virtue of the  receipt of 287,608  common  shares as the
          result of stock  dividends.  At December 31, 2000 such shares owned by
          the  Company   represented  50.1%  of  Glas-Aire's  total  issued  and
          outstanding common shares.

          The Company  accounted  for the  investment in Glas-Aire on the equity
          method from April 22, 1999 until September 23, 1999 when the Company's
          ownership exceeded 50%, whereupon the Company began to consolidate the
          accounts of Glas-Aire (Note 1A.).  Income  recognized under the equity
          method  related to  Glas-Aire  in 1999 was $114,961 and is included in
          other income in the Consolidated  Statement of Operations.  The common
          shares of the  Company,  held by  Glas-Aire,  are  treated as treasury
          shares in these financial statements.

          Glas-Aire  is  a  leading   designer,   developer,   manufacturer  and
          world-wide  marketer of sunroof  deflectors,  hood protectors and rear
          air deflectors  for  automobiles,  vans and light trucks.  Glas-Aire's
          corporate  offices  and   manufacturing   facilities  are  located  in
          Vancouver,  Canada.  The following  unaudited  pro forma  consolidated
          results of  operations  assumes  that the  consolidation  of Glas-Aire
          occurred  at  January  1,  1999.   The  pro  forma   results  are  for
          illustrative  purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the
          actual  results  which would have  occurred had the  transaction  been
          consummated at an earlier date, nor are they  indicative of results of
          operations which may occur in the future.

Note 3.     Acquisition of Rustic Crafts

            In March 1997,  the Company,  through its newly  formed  subsidiary,
            Rustic Crafts, acquired all of the operating assets, including cash,
            accounts   receivable,   inventory,   property  and   equipment  and
            intangibles, of Rustic Crafts Co., Inc. Rustic Crafts is involved in
            the  manufacture  of wood and  cast  marble  decorative  fireplaces,
            heater logs and related accessories.  The Company paid $1,100,000 in
            cash and issued  100,000  shares of common  stock and assumed  trade
            accounts payable, bank debt and certain other accrued liabilities of
            $413,778.  The  transaction  was  accounted  for using the  purchase
            method and resulted in goodwill and  intangibles  of $715,000.  Such
            goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line  basis over a fifteen
            year period.

Note 4.     Investment in Partnerships

            In  November  1994,  the  Company  invested  $350,000  for a limited
            partnership  interest  in  Security  Land  and  Development  Company
            Limited Partnership ("Security"),  which owns and operates an office
            complex. The Company has limited voting rights and is entitled to be
            allocated  95% of the  profit  and  loss  of the  Partnership  until
            October 31, 2003 (the lease  termination  date of the sole tenant of
            the office complex) and 50%  thereafter.  The Company is entitled to
            95% of operating cash flow distributions,  as defined, until October
            31,  2003,  which are  expected  to be limited  in  amount,  and 50%
            thereafter.

            In the year ended December 31, 2000,  the Company's  income from its
            equity  investment in the Partnership  was $4,712,615.  These funds,
            however,  are  presently  committed  for  the  amortization  of  the
            outstanding  principal  balance on Security's  real estate  mortgage
            and,  while  the  Company's  equity   investment  has  increased  to
            $24,565,881  the  partnership  does  not  provide  liquidity  to the
            Company in excess of the $100,000 annual management fee.

            For the years ended  December 31, 2000,  1999 and 1998,  the Company
            earned  $106,251,   $101,326,   and  $102,278,   respectively,   for
            management services provided to Security.

            Security was organized to own and operate two  buildings  containing
            approximately  717,000  net  rentable  square feet  consisting  of a
            two-story  office building and a connected  six-story  office tower.
            The  building  was  purchased  by Security in 1986 and is located on
            approximately  34.3 acres of land  which is also owned by  Security.
            The building has been occupied by the United States Social  Security
            Administration's  Office of Disability and International  Operations
            for approximately 25 years under leases between the United States of
            America,  acting by and through the General Services  Administration
            ("GSA").  Effective  November 1, 1994,  Security and the GSA entered
            into a nine-year  lease (the "Lease") for 100% of the building.  The
            Lease, among other provisions,  requires substantial renovations and
            improvements to the building, which were completed in 1998. Security
            has received

            an opinion of the  Assistant  General  Counsel to the GSA that lease
            payments  are not  subject  to annual  appropriation  by the  United
            States  Congress  and the  obligations  to make  such  payments  are
            unconditional general obligations of the United States Government.

            The Company accounts for the investment in partnership on the equity
            method, whereby the carrying value of the investment is increased or
            decreased by the Company's allocable share of Security's book income
            or loss. The investment in partnership  included in the Consolidated
            Balance  Sheets at December  31, 2000 and 1999 was  $24,565,881  and
            $19,959,517,  respectively.  The income  from the  Company's  equity
            investment in the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2000,
            1999  and   1998  was   $4,712,615,   $4,261,212   and   $3,950,090,
            respectively.  The undistributed  earnings from the Company's equity
            investment  in the  Partnership  as of  December  31,  2000 and 1999
            amounted to $24,215,881 and $19,609,517, respectively.

 Note 4.  Investment in Partnership (Continued)

          Effective  November  30,  2000 the Company  invested  $10,000 for a 5%
          limited  partnership  interest in 1500 Wood Lawn Limited  Partnership,
          the general partner of Security.

Note 5.   Note Payable

          The Company's subsidiary,  Rustic Crafts, has established a $1,000,000
          line of credit  with PNC Bank.  The line of credit  expires on May 18,
          2001 and is renewable annually, and bears interest at the Bank's prime
          rate minus one- half percent (9% at December 31,  2000).  The accounts
          receivable,   inventory  and  other  assets,   such  as  property  and
          equipment,  of Rustic Crafts have been pledged as collateral to secure
          the line of credit.  Rustic Crafts has agreed to maintain  certain net
          worth,  current  ratio and debt service  coverage and is in compliance
          with these  requirements  at December 31, 2000.  The line of credit is
          guaranteed by the Company.  At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the amounts
          outstanding  under  the line of credit  were  $616,174  and  $431,000,
          respectively.

          In connection  with the acquisition of the common shares of Glas-Aire,
          the Company issued a promissory  note in the amount of $650,000 to the
          seller of the shares.  The note bears interest at the rate of 7.5% and
          is  secured  by  a  first  priority  interest  in  200,000  shares  of
          Glas-Aire.  The outstanding balance at December 31, 1999 was $600,000.
          The note was repaid in January 2000.

          The  Company's  subsidiary,  Glas-Aire,  has  established  a  Canadian
          $1,000,000 (U.S. $680,000) revolving line of credit due on demand with
          a Canadian  bank.  The line of credit is  collateralized  by  accounts
          receivable,  inventories  certain equipment and other assets and bears
          interest at the rate of the Canadian  bank's prime rate plus  one-half
          percent (6.6%). The credit facility is renewable annually. At December
          31, 2000 and 1999,  the amounts  outstanding  under the line of credit
          were $0 and $118,262, respectively.

          The Company has outstanding  $126,000 of demand notes bearing interest
          at 10%,  payable  to a  shareholder.  Additionally,  the  Company  has
          outstanding a $650,000 demand note bearing interest at a rate of prime
          minus one percent to its President.  These  obligations are secured by
          the shares of Glas-Aire owned by the Company.

          On October 24, 2000,  the Company  obtained a  commitment  for a short
          term loan of $100,050  from a bank bearing  interest at the prime rate
          plus three-fourths percent,  adjusted monthly. As of December 31, 2000
          $76,000  remained  outstanding;  the  interest  rate was 10.25%.  This
          obligation is guaranteed by two shareholders,  one of whom is a former
          officer and director of the Company.

Note 6.   Long-Term Debt

          KBC Bank Loan - On June 24, 1998, the Company refinanced the long-term
          debt previously  outstanding  with Southern Indiana  Properties,  Inc.
          ("SIPI") and entered into a Loan  Agreement (the "Loan") with KBC Bank
          N.V.  ("KBC").  Under the terms of the Loan  Agreement,  KBC  advanced
          $9,383,320.  The  due  date of the  Loan is  November  30,  2003  with
          interest at the rate of 7.5% compounded  semi-annually  on each June 1
          and December 1, commencing  December 1, 1998. The interest may be paid
          by the Company in cash on these  semi-annual  dates or the Company may
          elect  to  add  the  interest  to  the  principal  of  the  Loan  then
          outstanding.  As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the amount outstanding
          under the Loan is $11,311,808 and $10,512,717, respectively, including
          $1,928,488 and $1,129,397 of interest,  through  December 31, 2000 and
          1999, respectively.

          The Loan is  secured by all of the  Company's  interest  in  Security,
          including  the  Company's  interest in all profits and  distributions,
          other than the payment of management  fees of $100,000  annually,  and
          all of the Company's rights,  powers,  and remedies under the Security
          Land and Development Company Limited Partnership  Agreement as amended
          and restated.  The security agreement requires the Company to maintain
          a certain ratio of debt to

          equity.  At any time,  the  Company  may prepay  the entire  principal
          balance  of  the  Loan,  plus  accrued  and  unpaid  interest,  plus a
          make-whole premium as defined in the Loan Agreement, if any.

          To  facilitate  the loan from KBC,  the  Company  purchased a residual
          value  insurance  policy through  R.V.I.  American  Insurance  Company
          ("RVI") which secures the repayment of the  outstanding  principal and
          interest when due with a maximum liability of $14 million.  Should RVI
          pay a claim  under this policy they will be entitled to certain of the
          Company's  rights with respect to the property of Security,  including
          but not limited to the right to solicit bona fide,  third party offers
          for the property and to accept such offers and bind the Partnership in
          order to recoup the amount paid.  The costs  related to the  insurance
          ($745,000)  along  with  legal fees and other  costs  associated  with
          obtaining the Loan ($205,000)  have been  capitalized as debt issuance
          costs  and are  being  amortized  over the life of the Loan  using the
          effective interest method.

          Credit  Agreement - In June 1996,  the Company  entered  into a Credit
          Agreement (the  "Agreement")  with Southern Indiana  Properties,  Inc.
          (the  "Lender")  for the  purpose of  obtaining  loans  secured by the
          Company's investment in Security.

          On June 24, 1998,  the Agreement was  refinanced by proceeds  advanced
          from KBC  Bank  N.V.  under  terms  and  conditions  described  above.
          Principal,  regular  interest,   contingent  interest  and  prepayment
          penalty totaling  $5,213,810 was paid to Southern Indiana  Properties,
          Inc. The  prepayment  of the Credit  Agreement  resulted in additional
          charges of $335,684 in the year ended  December  31,  1998,  resulting
          from the write-off of  unamortized  debt issuance costs and payment of
          prepayment  penalties.  Such amount is included as interest expense in
          the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

          Mortgage Loan - On March 25, 1998,  Rustic Crafts purchased a building
          of 126,000 square feet located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The purchase
          of this  facility was funded in part by a first  mortgage term loan in
          the amount of  $960,000.  The first  mortgage  term loan is payable in
          consecutive  monthly  installments  over  10  years  with  a  20  year
          amortization.  The balance  outstanding  at December 31, 2000 and 1999
          was $903,065 and $915,667, respectively.

          Equipment Loans - In connection with the purchase of the building, PNC
          Bank loaned the Company a total of $767,000 to finance the acquisition
          of new  equipment  and to  install  such  equipment  in the  facility.
          Principal payments on one loan of $604,000 are due to begin March 2000
          for 120 months in  amounts  sufficient  to  amortize  the  outstanding
          balance over twenty years from March 2000.  In March 2000 the interest
          rate changed to the average weekly yield on U.S.  Treasury Bills, plus
          200  basis  points.  The  remaining  loan in the  original  amount  of
          $163,500  is  payable in equal  monthly  installments  of $2,518.  The
          outstanding  balance  of these  loans was  $730,797  and  $747,855  at
          December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

          In June 1999,  Rustic Crafts obtained an additional loan from PNC Bank
          for the purpose of funding additional  equipment purchases and working
          capital  in the  amount  of  $156,000.  The loan is  payable  in equal
          monthly installments, including principal and interest, of $3,153. The
          outstanding balance was $118,927 and $146,263 at December 31, 2000 and
          1999, respectively.

          The interest  rates on the mortgage loan and the  equipment  loan vary
          from 7.52% to 8.50% as of December 31, 2000.

          Rustic  Crafts'  real  and  personal  property,   equipment,  accounts
          receivable,  inventory  and other general  intangibles  are pledged as
          security  for the  loans.  The loans are also  guaranteed  by  Regency
          Affiliates,  Inc., the parent company. The security agreement requires
          Rustic Crafts to maintain certain financial ratios.  Rustic Crafts was
          in compliance with such ratios at December 31, 2000.

            Vehicle Note - Rustic  Crafts had an  outstanding  a vehicle note in
            the amount of $11,922 at December 31, 1999.

            Lease Obligations - Glas-Aire has two long-term lease obligations to
            purchase equipment.  These obligations were five year capital leases
            and have been recorded as a capital asset and  long-term  debt.  The
            Equipment,  with a cost of $292,273  and  $303,171  and  accumulated
            depreciation  of $46,764 and  $18,980,  as of December  31, 2000 and
            1999,  respectively,  is pledged as collateral  for the leases.  The
            terms of the leases  require  equal monthly  installments  of $7,484
            including  principal and interest over a five year period.  Interest
            rates on the leases range from 6.5% to 8.6%.  The total  outstanding
            balance of these lease  obligations is $136,254 at December 31, 2000

            Zero Coupon Bonds - The zero coupon non-recourse  secured bonds, due
            January 2, 2002,  had a face value of $542,000 and a carrying  value
            of $414,700 at December 31,  1998.  The bonds were issued by NRC and
            the difference  (discount) between the face value and carrying value
            was being  amortized  utilizing the interest  method at 9%. Interest
            expense  related  to the  bonds  for 1999 and 1998 was  $36,905  and
            $31,200, respectively.

            In 1999,  certain  bondholders  agreed to exchange these zero coupon
            bonds for 121,000 shares of the Company's  common stock at an agreed
            upon per share value of $1.00.  Also,  a  significant  amount of the
            bonds were retired in  connection  with the Agreement of the Company
            to discontinue  certain claims against one of the  bondholders.  The
            exchange of common stock for the bonds and  settlement of the claims
            resulted in a gain on  retirement of debt of $330,605 (net of tax of
            $-0-,  due to available net operating loss  carryforward),  which is
            reflected  in  the  accompanying   statement  of  operations  as  an
            extraordinary gain.

Note 8.     Serial Preferred Stock (Continued)

            (a)    This represents the estimated  maximum  possible  liquidation
                   value of the Series C preferred  shares,  which is defined as
                   the  lesser of: 1) net  proceeds  of the assets of NRDC or 2)
                   the  redemption  value  (defined  below).  In  the  event  of
                   liquidation,  the  Series C shares  are  senior  to all other
                   shares of the  Company's  stock,  with the  exception  of the
                   Series E shares.

            (b)    The liquidation  value of the Junior Series D shares includes
                   accrued  and unpaid  dividends  of $125,902  and  $125,902 at
                   December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

            On January 31,  2000,  the  holders of the Series E preferred  stock
            either  converted  their  preferred  shares to the Company's  common
            stock or received  cash equal to the par value of the  shares,  plus
            accrued dividends. The Company issued 95,877 of its common shares in
            exchange  for 885  shares  of  preferred  stock and paid cash in the
            amount of $159,300 for 1,593 shares.

            Series C. - The Series C shares  were issued on July 7, 1993 as part
            of  the  transaction  to  acquire  an  80%  interest  in  NRDC.  The
            cumulative  dividend right is equal to 20% (not to exceed  $500,000)
            of annual after tax earnings of NRDC. At the Company's  option,  the
            Series C may be redeemed at the lesser of (a) the stated  value plus
            accrued and unpaid  dividends  or (b) the fair  market  value of the
            common stock interest acquired by the Company in NRDC.
<PAGE>

            Series  B - The  Series B shares  were  issued  in 1991 as part of a
            restructuring  plan  limited  to senior  lenders  and was  issued in
            exchange  for all  obligations  and any  claims  or causes of action
            relating to the Company's obligations and guarantees. Such preferred
            stock  includes,   among  other  provisions  and  preferences,   the
            following:

            (a)    A 60% cumulative  dividend right commencing on the 24th month
                   from  the  consummation  of  a  defined   "initial   business
                   combination transaction" (which occurred with the acquisition
                   of Rustic Crafts in 1997 (see Note 3)) and if the Company has
                   reached a defined  ratio of  earnings  to fixed  charges.  In
                   addition,  dividends  accrue  for a period  of 35  additional
                   months without cash payment.

            (b)    At the Company's option, the shares may be redeemed,  subject
                   to certain  limitations,  by cash  payment  or by  exchanging
                   shares of its common stock at 77% of its stated value divided
                   by the quoted market value of its common stock.

            (c)    A contingent conversion provision which conversion right, and
                   the Company common shares to be issued in connection with the
                   conversion, would be based on the stated value divided by the
                   average  bid and asked  price for the 90 days  preceding  the
                   conversion date of the Company's common shares.  In addition,
                   the number of the Company's common shares to be received upon
                   conversion is subject to certain limitations.

            Junior Series D - The junior  preferred  stock was issued in 1992 in
            exchange for the Company's  Restructuring  Serial  Promissory Notes.
            This preferred stock is redeemable,  at the Company's option, at the
            stated value plus accrued and unpaid  dividends and is  contingently
            convertible  into common at the fair  market  value of the common as
            determined  by the average of the bid and asked price for the thirty
            (30) day period preceding the conversion date.

            Generally,  no dividends can be paid on the  Company's  common stock
            until all cumulative  dividends on the serial  preferred  stock have
            been paid. Additionally, no dividends on the Company's common shares
            can be paid if the Company is in default or in arrears  with respect
            to any sinking or analogous fund or any call or

Note 8.     Serial Preferred Stock (Continued)

            tenders or other  agreement  for the  purchase,  redemption or other
            retirement of shares of preferred  stock. No provision for dividends
            has been  made for the  Company's  Series B and C  "increasing  rate
            preferred stock," as defined in Staff Accounting  Bulletin Topic 5Q,
            due to the contingent nature of dividends on such shares.

            Generally the preferred shares have limited voting rights.  However,
            in the  event  dividends  payable  on  the  Series  C and E  shares,
            respectively,   are  accumulated  and  unpaid  for  seven  quarterly
            dividends  (whether or not declared and whether or not consecutive),
            the holders of record of the Series C shares,  shall thereafter have
            the  right to elect  two  directors  (each)  until  all  arrears  in
            required  cash  dividends  (whether or not  declared) on such shares
            have been paid.  The Company's  bylaws  provide for eight members on
            its Board of  Directors.  At  December  31,  2000 the company had no
            accumulated and unpaid dividends on Series C preferred shares.

Note 9.     Stock Options/Stock Option Plans

            Effective  June 3, 1997,  the Company issued options to purchase 6.1
            million shares of common stock to Statesman Group,  Inc. The options
            were  issued to  Statesman  in order to secure  the  release  of Mr.
            William R. Ponsoldt,  Sr. to serve as President and Chief  Executive
            Officer of the Company and to  recognize in part,  the  amendment to
            the  Series C  preferred  shares  under  which  Statesman  forfeited
            certain  common  stock  conversion   rights  with  respect  thereto.
            Statesman  also agreed to provide loan  guarantees not to exceed the
            sum of  $300,000  upon the  request of the  company and a showing of
            reasonable  need.  Statesman  and/or its  affiliated  interests have
            provided loan guarantees and/or unsecured prime interest rate direct
            loans to the Company exceeding  $2,000,000 since June 1997. Pursuant
            to the  Amended  and  Restated  Agreement  between  the  Company and
            Statesman,  until their date of  expiration,  the  options  shall be
            exercisable  at any time in whole or in part at a price equal to the

<PAGE>

            lower of (a) the closing trading price as of the most recent date on
            which at least  10,000  shares of such stock were  traded or (b) the
            average  closing  trading  price of the shares during the ninety day
            period  immediately  preceding  the date of  exercise.  The  Company
            agreed to reserve  sufficient shares to meet the requirements of the
            options.  The  options  became  exercisable  immediately  and remain
            exercisable  until  April 15,  2007.  At the  option  of  Statesman,
            payment may be made by Statesman  for  exercise of the  options,  in
            whole  or in part,  in the form of a  promissory  note  executed  by
            Statesman,  secured only by a pledge of the shares purchased,  which
            promissory  note will accrue  interest  for any quarter at the prime
            rate in effect  on the last day of the  quarter  at Chase  Manhattan
            Bank, with interest and principal  payable in a balloon payment five
            years after the date of execution of the note,  provided that if the
            Company's Board of Directors  reasonably  determines that exercising
            the  options  by  delivery  of a note would  render  the  respective
            purchase of shares void or voidable,  then the board may require, as
            a condition to exercise of the options,  that  Statesman  either (i)
            pay at least the par value of the shares in cash  (with the  balance
            paid by delivery of a note) or (ii)  provide  acceptable  collateral
            other than the shares  themselves to secure payment of the note. The
            Company  has   determined   that  these   options  have  no  readily
            determinable  fair value  consistent with the provisions of SFAS No.
            123.  therefore,  the Company has not recognized any cost associated
            with the  issuance of these  options and net  earnings per share for
            1997 have not reflected any such costs.

            In  2000  and  1999,   the   Company   issued   90,000  and  90,000,
            respectively,  non-qualified  common  stock  options at the exercise
            price of $.84 and $.93,  respectively,  the fair market value of the
            Company's  common  stock on the date of grant,  to the  directors in
            accordance with the Director's  Compensation Program approved by the
            shareholders.  The 2000 and 1999  options  will vest  completely  on
            February 5, 2001 and 2000, and are exercisable  until August 5, 2005
            and 2004, respectively.

            The Company applies  Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and
            related  Interpretations in accounting for options.  The Company has
            elected to treat these option awards to directors as employee  based
            compensation  and therefore has not recorded the estimated  value of
            these options in the accompanying statement of operations.  The fair
            value of the  Company's  stock-based  compensation  to directors was
            estimated  using  the   Black-Scholes   option  pricing  model.  The
            Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating

<PAGE>

                    Regency Affiliates, Inc. and Subsidiaries
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 9.     Stock Options/Stock Option Plans (Continued)

            the fair value of traded options which have no vesting  restrictions
            and are fully  transferable.  In addition,  the Black-Scholes  model
            requires the input of highly  subjective  assumptions  including the
            expected   stock  price   volatility.   The  Company's   stock-based
            compensation has characteristics  significantly different from those
            traded  options and changes in the  subjective  input can materially
            affect the fair  value  estimate.  The fair  value of the  Company's
            stock awards was estimated  assuming the following  assumptions:  no
            expected dividends, risk free interest rate of 5.9% expected average
            life  of  approximately  3.5 to 5 years  and  expected  stock  price
            volatility  of  40.69%  in 2000 and  55.46%  in 1999.  The  weighted
            average fair value of options  granted was $.38 during 2000 and $.43
            during 1999.

            A subsidiary of the Company,  Glas-Aire,  also issued 60,000 options
            for its  common  stock to its  directors  in 1999.  The  assumptions
            related to the Glas-Aire  options were: no expected  dividend,  risk
            free  interest rate of 5.64%,  expected  average life of 3 years and
            expected stock price  volatility of 216%. The weighted  average fair
            value of options granted was $4.04.

            Had  compensation  cost for the options been determined based on the
            fair  value at the grant  dates for the  awards,  net income and net
            income per common share basic and diluted would have been as follows

Note 10.    Income Taxes

            As  referred  to in Note 1, the Company  accounts  for income  taxes
            under SFAS 109,  "Accounting  for income  Taxes." The deferred taxes
            are the result of long-term temporary  differences between financial
            reporting  and tax  reporting  for  depreciation,  earnings from the
            Company's  partnership  investment in Security Land and  Development
            Company Limited Partnership related to depreciation and amortization
            and the recognition of income tax carryforward items.

            At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company's net deferred tax asset,
            utilizing a 34% effective tax rate, consists of:

</TABLE>

            The valuation  allowance was  established to reduce the net deferred
            tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be  realized.
            This  reduction is necessary  due to  uncertainty  of the  Company's
            ability  to utilize  the net  operating  loss and tax  credit  carry
            forwards before they expire.  The deferred tax liability  relates to
            depreciation  and is due to the  consolidation  of the  accounts  of
            Glas-Aire in 1999.  Glas-Aire files a separate return for income tax
            purposes.

            For regular  federal income tax purposes,  the Company has remaining
            net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $28,253,000. These
            losses can be carried  forward to offset future  taxable income and,
            if not

            utilized, will expire in varying amounts beginning in the year 2001.
            The  Company's  tax returns have not recently  been  examined by the
            Internal Revenue Service  ("Service") and there is no assurance that
            the Service  would not attempt to limit the Company's use of its net
            operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

            For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the tax effect
            of net operating loss  carryforwards  reduced the current  provision
            for regular Federal income taxes by approximately $670,000, $980,000
            and $583,000, respectively. At December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the
            Company has provided $425,018,  $235,309 and $98,583,  respectively,
            for taxes,  which  relate to federal  taxes,  including  alternative
            minimum tax liabilities (See Note 13) and state income taxes.

Note 11.    Employment Agreements

            On June 3, 1997,  Regency entered into an Employment  Agreement with
            William R. Ponsoldt,  Sr., pursuant to which he became the President
            and CEO of the Company.  The Agreement  provides for Mr. Ponsoldt to
            continue  in  these  duties  until  attainment  of  retirement  age,
            provided  that he may resign upon the provision of 30 days notice to
            the Company and further  provided  that Mr.  Ponsoldt may be removed
            from  office  upon  death  or  disability  or for  just  cause.  The
            Agreement  provides  for a base  salary in annual  installments,  in
            advance, of $250,000 each, which salary is to be adjusted on January
            1 of every year by any increase since the previous  January 1 in the
            Consumer  Price Index  ("CPI") for All Urban  Consumers,  U.S.  city
            average,  as  published by the U. S.  Department  of Labor Bureau of
            Labor  Statistics.  As additional  compensation,  Mr. Ponsoldt is to
            receive  an  amount  equal  to  20%  of the  Company's  increase  in
            quarterly  common  stock  net  worth,  which  is  defined  to be the
            difference  between  (i)  total  shareholders'  equity  and (ii) any
            shareholders'  equity  accounts  relating  to  preferred  stock.  At
            December 31, 2000 and 1999,  approximately  $147,811  and  $295,000,
            respectively,  of  additional  compensation  is  included in accrued
            expenses  in the  consolidated  balance  sheets,  the  former  to be
            converted  to debt and  secured  by the common  shares of  Glas-Aire
            owned by the  Company  (See Note 5). The Company may elect to pay up
            to 50% of the additional compensation by the issuance of warrants to
            purchase the  Company's  common stock at a price equal to 50% of the
            average bid price for the  Company's  common  stock for the calendar
            quarter  for  which  the  increased  compensation  is  payable.  The
            Agreement  further  provides for Mr.  Ponsoldt to receive health and
            disability  insurance  ($100,000/year  in the  event  of  long  term
            disability),  an automobile  allowance of $600/month (to be adjusted
            by  increases  in the  CPI),  and  reimbursement  of  expenses.  The
            Agreement  provides  that Mr.  Ponsoldt  will not  compete  with the
            Company  for a two year  period  following  the  termination  of his
            employment   and  provides   for   indemnification   under   certain
            circumstances.  Any  disputes  between the Company and Mr.  Ponsoldt
            under the Agreement are to be resolved through arbitration.

Note 13.    Contingencies, Risks and Uncertainties

            The  Company  is  subject  to  numerous  contingencies,   risks  and
            uncertainties  including,  but not  limited to, the  following  that
            could have a severe impact on the Company:

            (i)    The Company currently does not generate positive cash flow as
                   the  current  activities  of the  Company  do not,  in and of
                   themselves,  generate  sufficient  cash  flow  to  cover  its
                   corporate  operating  expenses and thus the Company must rely
                   on its cash  reserves to fund these  expenses.  The Company's
                   ability to continue in existence is partly dependent upon its
                   ability  to  attain  satisfactory  levels of  operating  cash
                   flows.

            (ii)   The Company  currently lacks the necessary  infrastructure at
                   the site of the Groveland Mine in order to permit the Company
                   to make more than  casual  sales of the  aggregate  (See Note
                   1.G).

            (iii)  An unsecured  default in the Lease or sudden  catastrophe  to
                   the Security West Building from  uninsured acts of God or war
                   could have a  materially  adverse  impact upon the  Company's
                   investment in Security Land and  Development  Company Limited
                   Partnership  and,  therefore,   its  financial  position  and
                   results of operations (See Note 4).

            (iv)   The failure of the Social  Security  Administration  to renew
                   its lease of the Security West  Buildings upon its expiration
                   on October 31, 2003 could have a  materially  adverse  impact
                   upon  the   Company's   investment   in  Security   Land  and
                   Development Company Limited Partnership.

            (v)    The Company has significant tax loss and credit carryforwards
                   and no assurance  can be provided  that the Internal  Revenue
                   Service would not attempt to limit or disallow altogether the
                   Company's use,  retroactively and/or  prospectively,  of such
                   carryforwards,  due to ownership changes or any other reason.
                   The  disallowance  of the  utilization  of the  Company's net
                   operating loss would severely impact the Company's  financial
                   position  and results of  operations  due to the  significant
                   amounts  of  taxable  income   (generated  by  the  Company's
                   investment  in  Security)  that has in the past been,  and is
                   expected  in the future to be,  offset by the  Company's  net
                   operating loss carryforwards (See Note 10).

<PAGE>

            (iv)   As  described  at Note 16,  both of the  Company's  Operating
                   Subsidiaries (Rustic Crafts and Glas-Aire) are dependent on a
                   limited  number of  customers  for a  substantial  portion of
                   their respective  revenues.  The loss of one or more of these
                   customers  could have a  significant  effect on the Company's
                   results of operations.

Note 14.    Lease Commitments

            Glas-Aire  leases  factory,   warehouse  and  office  space  and  is
            committed to the minimum  lease  payment of $110,155 for each of the
            next two years under an operating  lease for premises.  Rent expense
            was  $165,393,  $113,514  and  $106,312  for the eleven month period
            ended December 31, 2000 and for the years ended January 31, 2000 and
            1999 respectively.

Note 15.    Profit Sharing Program

            In 1994,  the  Company's  subsidiary,  Glas-Aire,  adopted  a profit
            sharing  program which  provides  that 10% of the  Company's  income
            before  income  taxes  and  provision  for  profit  sharing  may  be
            distributed to officers and employees of the company. For the period
            ended  December  31,  2000 the  provision  for  profit  sharing  was
            $112,011 (January 31, 2000 - $106,684, January 31, 1999 - $89,496).

 Note 16.   Segment Information

            The Company's  operating  structure  includes operating segments for
            Automobile  Accessories  (the  operations  of  Glas-Aire,  which was
            acquired in September  1999 (Note 2)), Home  Furnishing  Accessories
            (the  operations of Rustic Crafts,  which was acquired in March 1997
            (Note 3)),  Investment in  Partnership  (the  investment in Security
            Land and Development  Limited  Partnership  (Note 4)), and Corporate
            and Other.  The Company  operates and  generates  its revenue in the
            United States,  Canada and Japan.  One Home  Furnishing  Accessories
            customer   accounted  for   approximately   16%,  19%,  and  53%  of
            consolidated  sales for 2000,  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  Three
            Automobile  Accessories  customers  accounted  for  60%  and  40% of
            consolidated sales for 2000, and 1999, respectively.  On a pro forma
            basis,  it is anticipated  that these three  customers would account
            for up to 56% of the consolidated sales in 1999.

ITEM  9.  CHANGES  IN AND  DISAGREEMENTS  WITH  ACCOUNTANTS  ON  ACCOUNTING  AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

The  Company has  dismissed  Hausser & Taylor LLP as its  independent  certified
accountant,  and has engaged the firm of Rosenberg,  Rich, Baker & Berman as its
independent  certified  accountants.  Rosenberg,  Rich prepared the audit of the
company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000.

The change of accountants was pursuant to a bidding procedure  undertaken by the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The decision to change accountants to
Rosenberg,  Rich was  recommended  by the Audit  Committee  to the full Board of
Directors following such procedure,  with the full Board approving the change of
accountants at its December 4, 2000 meeting.

Management  represents  as  follows:  (a) There  have been no  disputes  between
management  and Hausser & Taylor and their reports have not contained an adverse
opinion or  disclaimer  of  opinion,  and were not  qualified  or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles; (b) during the Company's two
most  recent  fiscal  years and any  subsequent  interim  period,  there were no
disagreements  with Hausser & Taylor on any matter of  accounting  principles or
practices,  financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedure; and
(c)  Hausser  & Taylor  expressed  no  disagreement  or  difference  of  opinion
regarding any "reportable" event as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K.

In  addition,  during  the  Company's  two  most  recent  fiscal  years  and any
subsequent  interim  period,  Hausser & Taylor has not advised the Company that:
(a) the internal controls necessary to develop reliable financial statements did
not exist;  (b)  information had come to the attention of Hausser & Taylor which
made it unwilling  to rely on  management's  representation,  or unwilling to be
associated with the financial  statements prepared by management;  (c) the scope
of the audit should have been expanded  significantly;  or (d)  information  had
come to Hausser & Taylor's  attention that it had concluded would, or if further
investigated  might have,  materially  impacted the fairness or reliability of a
previously issued audit report or the underlying  financial  statements,  or the
financial  statements  issued  or to be issued  covering  the  fiscal  period(s)
subsequent  to the  date  of  the  most  recent  audited  financial  statements,
including  information  that might have precluded the issuance of an unqualified
audit  report,  and the  issue  had not been  resolved  to  Hausser &  Taylor's
satisfaction.

The Company requested, and Hausser & Taylor has furnished, a letter addressed to
the Securities and Exchange Commission stating that Hausser & Taylor agrees with
the above statements that pertain to Hausser & Taylor.

There has not been and do not  presently  exist any  disagreements  between  the
Company  and  its  accountants   concerning  accounting   principles,   auditing
procedures or financial disclosure.

Aggregated Option/SAR Exercises in Last Fiscal Year and FY-End Option/SAR Value.

There are no stock options (nor tandem SARs) nor  freestanding  SARs outstanding

Stock Options Granted to Statesman Group, Inc.

Pursuant to an  Agreement  dated June 3, 1997,  as amended and restated on March
24, 1998,  Statesman  Group,  Inc.  was granted  options to purchase 6.1 million
shares of Common  Stock.  Statesman  owned  approximately  25% of the  Company's
outstanding  common  stock prior to the issuance of these  options.  The options
were  issued to  Statesman  in order to secure  the  release  of Mr.  William R.
Ponsoldt,  Sr. to serve as President and Chief Executive  Officer of the Company
and to recognize in part,  the amendment to the Series C Preferred  Shares under
which  Statesman  forfeited  the common  stock  conversion  rights with  respect
thereto.  Statesman also agreed to provide loan guarantees not to exceed the sum
of $300,000  upon the request of the Company and a showing of  reasonable  need.
The Company has recently  commenced  accessing the line of loans from Statesman.
The loans have been collateralized with holdings of Glas-Aire Stock owned by the
Company. Statesman and/or its affiliated interests have provided loan guarantees
and/or  unsecured  prime  interest  rate direct  loans to the Company  exceeding
$2,000,000  since June 1997.  Pursuant  to the Amended  and  Restated  Agreement
between the Company and Statesman,  until their date of expiration,  the options
shall be  exercisable  at any  time in whole or in part at a price  equal to the
lower of (a) the  closing  trading  price as of the most recent date on which at
least  10,000  shares of such  stock were  traded,  or (b) the  average  closing
trading price of the shares during the ninety day period  immediately  preceding
the date of exercise.  The Company agreed to reserve  sufficient  shares to meet
the requirements of the options. The options became exercisable  immediately and
remain exercisable until April 15, 2007. At the option of Statesman, payment may
be made by Statesman  for exercise of the options,  in whole or in part,  in the
form of a promissory note executed by Statesman, secured only by a pledge of the
shares purchased,  which promissory note will accrue interest for any quarter at
the prime rate in effect on the last day of the quarter at Chase Manhattan Bank,
with  interest and principal  payable in a balloon  payment five years after the
date of execution of the note, provided that if the Company's Board of Directors
reasonably  determines  that  exercising the options by delivery of a note would
render the  respective  purchase of shares void or voidable,  then the Board may
require,  as a condition to exercise of the options,  that Statesman  either (i)
pay at least the par  value of the  shares in cash  (with  the  balance  paid by
delivery of a note), or (ii) provide acceptable collateral other than the shares
themselves  to  secure  payment  of the  note.  The  Company  received  no  cash
consideration  with respect to the issuance of the  securities to Statesman,  no
commissions  were paid, and no underwriter was involved.  The options granted to
Statesman have no readily determinable value and, therefore, the Company has not
recognized any costs  associated  with the issuance of these options.  Statesman
has  recently  given  notice to the Company of it's  intention  to exercise  the
options.

Non Qualified Stock Options.

Non qualified options to acquire a total of 90,000 common shares were granted in
2000 to directors of the Company in accordance with the Directors'  compensation
program as approved by the Shareholders in the 1999 Meeting of Shareholders. The
options  were  granted  at an  exercise  price of $0.93  and  $0.84  per  share,
respectively,  the fair value of the common shares at date of grant. The options
vest on February 5, 2000 and February 5, 2001,respectivley,  and are exercisable
to August 5, 2004 and August 5, 2005, respectively.

which the increased  compensation is payable. The Agreement further provides for

                                                             Washington, D.C.
$10,000                                                      November 30, 2000

          FOR VALUE RECEIVED,  REGENCY AFFILIATES,  INC., a Delaware corporation
(the "Maker"), promises to pay to the order of CONRAD CAFRITZ, an individual, or
his assigns (the "Holder"),  at 1660 L Street, N.W., Suite 600,  Washington,  DC

designate,  on November 1, 2030 (the "Maturity  Date"),  the principal amount of
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ($10,000).  Until the Maturity Date, Maker shall pay to the
Holder,  as interest,  a sum equal to 50% of (i) the  distributions  of Net Cash
Flow  received by Maker  pursuant to Section 10.01 of that certain First Amended
and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of 1500 Woodlawn Limited Partnership,
as amended  (the "A/R  Agreement")  plus (ii) the  distributions  of Proceeds of

Agreement,  immediately  upon  receipt of each such  distribution.  All payments
hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America, without
offset.

          The unpaid  principal  amount of this Note may not be prepaid in whole
or in part at any time  without the prior  written  consent of the Holder,  such
consent to be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Holder.

          The occurrence of the following  shall  constitute an event of default
("Event of Default") hereunder:

               1    Failure to pay, when due, the  principal,  any interest,  or
                    any other sum payable  hereunder,  and  continuance  of such
                    failure for five (5)  business  days after the date on which
                    such principal,  installment of interest or other sum is due
                    (whether upon  maturity  hereof,  upon any interest  payment
                    date, upon acceleration, or otherwise).

               2    Failure  of Maker  generally  to pay its debts as such debts
                    become  due,  the  admission  by  Maker  in  writing  of its
                    inability  to pay its debts as such debts become due, or the
                    making by Maker of any general assignment for the benefit of
                    creditors.

               3    Commencement  by  Maker  of any  case,  proceeding  or other
                    action  seeking  reorganization,   arrangement,  adjustment,
                    liquidation,  dissolution, or composition of it or its debts
                    under  any  law  relating  to  bankruptcy,   insolvency,  or
                    reorganization, or relief of debtors, or seeking appointment
                    of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or other similar official
                    for it or for all or any substantial part of its property.

               4    Commencement of any case, proceeding or other action against
                    Maker seeking to have any order for relief  entered  against
                    Maker as  debtor,  or seeking  reorganization,  arrangement,
                    adjustment, liquidation, dissolution or composition of Maker
                    or  its  debts  under  any  law   relating  to   bankruptcy,
                    insolvency,  reorganization or relief of debtors, or seeking
                    appointment  or a  receiver,  trustee,  custodian  or  other
                    similar  official  for  Maker or for all or any  substantial
                    partn of the property of Maker,  and (i) Maker shall, by any
                    act or omission,  indicate  its consent to,  approval of, or
                    acquiescence  in such case,  proceeding  or action,  or (ii)
                    such case,  proceeding or action  results in the entry of an
                    order for relief which is not, fully stayed within seven (7)
                    business days after the entry  thereof,  or (iii) such case,
                    proceeding  or action  remains  undismissed  for a period of
                    fifteen (15) days or more or is dismissed or suspended  only
                    pursuant to Section 305 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
                    or any  corresponding  provision of any future United States
                    bankruptcy law.
<PAGE>

          Upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default hereunder, the entire
principal amount hereof,  and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon,  shall be
accelerated,  and shall be  immediately  due and  payable,  at the option of the
Holder,  without  demand  or  notice,  and  in  addition  thereto,  and  not  in
substitution  therefor, the Holder shall be entitled to exercise any one or more
of the rights and remedies  provided by applicable law. Failure to exercise said
option or to pursue such other  remedies  shall not  constitute a waiver of such
option or such other remedies or of the right to exercise any of the same in the
event of any subsequent Event of Default hereunder.

          The Maker  promises to pay all costs and expenses  (including  without
limitation attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred in connection with the
collection  hereof,  and to perform  each and every  covenant or agreement to be
performed by the Maker under this Note and any other  instrument  evidencing the
obligation represented by this Note.

          Each  Obligor  which  term  shall  include  the Maker and all  makers,
sureties, guarantors, endorsers, and other persons assuming obligations pursuant
to this Note under this Note hereby waives presentment,  protest, demand, notice
of dishonor, and all other notices, and all defenses and pleas on the grounds of
any  extension  or  extensions  of the time of payments or the due dates of this
Note, in whole or in part, before or after maturity,  with or without notice. No
renewal or  extension of this Note,  no release of any Obligor,  and no delay in
enforcement  of this Note or in exercising any right or power  hereunder,  shall
affect the liability of any Obligor.  The pleading of any statute of limitations
as a defense to any demand against any Obligor is expressly waived.

          No single or partial exercise by the Holder of any right hereunder, or
under any other agreement pertaining hereto, shall preclude any other or further
exercise  thereof or the exercise of any other  rights.  No delay or omission on
the part of the Holder in  exercising  any right  hereunder  shall  operate as a
waiver of such right or of any other right under this Note.

          This Note and all agreements between the Maker and the Holder relating
hereto  are  hereby  expressly  limited  so  that  in no  contingency  or  event
whatsoever,  whether by reason of  acceleration  or otherwise,  shall the amount
paid or agreed to be paid to the Holder for the use, forbearance or detention of
money hereunder exceed the maximum amount  permissible  under applicable law. If
from any circumstance  whatsoever  fulfillment of any provision  hereof,  at the
time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve  transcending the
limit of validity  prescribed  by law,  then, i so facto,  the  obligation to be
fulfilled  shall be reduced to the limit of such validity,  and if from any such
circumstance the Holder shall ever receive interest,  or anything which might be
deemed  interest  under  applicable  law,  which would exceed the highest lawful
rate,  such amount  which would be  excessive  interest  shall be applied to the
reduction of the  principal  amount owing on account of this Note and not to the
payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of
principal  of this Note,  such excess  shall be refunded to the Maker.  All sums
paid or agreed to be paid to the Holder for the use, forbearance or detention of
the  indebtedness of the Maker to the Holder shall,  to the extent  permitted by
applicable  law,  be deemed to be  amortized,  prorated,  allocated  and  spread
throughout the full term of such indebtedness  until payment in full so that the
actual rate of interest on account of such  indebtedness  is uniform  throughout
the term thereof.  The terms and provisions of this paragraph  shall control and
supersede  every other provision of this Note and all other  agreements  between
the Maker and the Holder.


<PAGE>

          The  Maker  hereby  declares,   represents,   and  warrants  that  the
indebtedness  evidenced  hereby  is made (i) for the  purpose  of  acquiring  or
carrying on a business,  professional,  or commercial  activity and (ii) for the
purpose of  acquiring  real or  personal  property as an  investment  or for the
purpose of carrying on an investment  activity,  within the meaning of D.C. Code
Title 28, sections 3301(d)(1)(B) and (C) (1981 and Supp. 1985).

          Whenever  used herein,  the words  "Maker" and "Holder" and  "Obligor"
shall be deemed to include their respective successors and assigns.

          This Note shall be governed by and  construed  under and in accordance
with the laws of District of Columbia (but not including the choice of law rules
thereoo.

          IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the undersigned have duly executed this Note, or
have caused this Note to be duly  executed  on their  behalf,  as of the day and
year first hereinabove set forth.
