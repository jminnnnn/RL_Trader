ITEM  1.     BUSINESS

Except  for  historical  information  contained herein, the following discussion
contains  forward-looking  statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Such
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding
future  events  and  our plans and expectations. Our actual results could differ
materially  from  those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under
"Factors  That  May Affect Future Results," and "Forward looking Statements", as
well  as  those  discussed  elsewhere  in  this  Form  10-K.

GENERAL  DEVELOPMENT  OF  BUSINESS.
- ----------------------------------

Regency  Affiliates,  Inc.,  formerly  TransContinental  Energy Corporation, was
organized  as  a  Delaware  corporation  in  1980  to  be  the  successor  to
Transcontinental  Oil  Corporation,  which  existed  since  1947.

After  a  restructuring  in  1992, the Company, on July 7, 1993, acquired an 80%
interest  in  National  Resource  Development  Corporation  ("NRDC")  (the "NRDC
Transaction")  by  the  issuance of 2,975,000 shares of the Company's $0.40 P.V.
Common Stock, 208,850 shares of the Company's cumulative $100 Series C Preferred
Stock  and  20%  of  the outstanding shares of Transcontinental Drilling Company
("Drilling"),  a  subsidiary  of  the  Company  to  the  Statesman  Group,  Inc.
("Statesman"), an international business corporation organized under the laws of
the  Bahamas  (see  Item  12).  NRDC's  principal  asset  consists of previously
quarried  and  stockpiled  rock  (Aggregate) inventory located at a mine site in
Michigan.  The  Aggregate  inventory  was pledged to secure repayment of certain
Zero Coupon Bonds which have been issued by NRDC having a face value at maturity
of  $542,000  on  January  1, 2002. These Bonds were retired in 1999 through the
issuance  of  common stock of the Company.   As part of the NRDC Transaction, we
acquired 80% of the issued and outstanding stock of NRDC. The remainder (20%) is
owned  by  Statesman.

On  November  18,  1994,  we acquired a limited partnership interest in Security
Land  and  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership (the "Partnership") for an
equity  investment  of $350,000. The Partnership owns an office building complex
in  Woodlawn,  Maryland,  which  is  leased to the United States Social Security
Administration.

On  March 17, 1997, Regency, through Rustic Crafts International, Inc., a wholly
owned  subsidiary, acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Rustic
Crafts,  Co.,  Inc.,  a manufacturer of wood and cast marble decorative electric
fireplaces  and related accessories. Consideration for the acquisition consisted
of cash of $1,100,000, assumption of certain liabilities, and 100,000 restricted
shares  of  our  Common  Stock.

On  April  22, 1999, we acquired 513,915 shares of the common stock of Glas-Aire
Industries  Group,  Ltd.  ("Glas-Aire")  in  exchange  for  a promissory note of
$650,000  due January 1, 2000, at an interest rate of 7.5% per annum, which note
was  guaranteed  by  Mr.  William  Ponsoldt,  Sr.,  President  of  Regency,  and


                                      -3-
<PAGE>
$1,213,000  in cash. Glas-Aire is a reporting company, and its shares are listed
on  the  Nasdaq  small  cap  market  under  the symbol "GLAR" and on the Pacific
Exchange "GLA". The cash was obtained from an affiliate of Statesman through the
issuance  of an unsecured demand note at the interest rate of 7.5% per annum. We
also purchased 3,000 shares of the common stock of Glas-Aire on the open market.

On August 2, 1999, we acquired 41,600 shares of the common stock of Glas-Aire on
the  open  market  for  $119,619.  The  funds  were  provided by an affiliate of
Statesman  on  an  unsecured  basis.

On  August  14,  1999, we sold 2,852,375 shares of our common stock to Glas-Aire
for  cash  of  $1,967,960  and 86,000 shares of Glas-Aire common stock for total
consideration  of  $2,281,900.

On  September 23, 1999, we closed a common stock exchange agreement with certain
shareholders  of  Glas-Aire.  Under  the  agreement,  Regency,  in  a  private
transaction,  issued  1,188,000  shares  of  its restricted common stock to such
shareholders  in  exchange  for  288,000  Glas-Aire  common  shares  held by the
shareholders.

On  October  1,  2001,  we announced that we had completed a transaction for the
disposing  of  our interest in Glas-Aire.  Pursuant to an agreement entered into
on  September  17,  2001  and amended on October 1, 2001, we exchanged 1,215,105
shares  of  common  stock  of  Glas-Aire,  representing approximately 50% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Glas-Aire, for $2,500,000 plus 4,040,375 shares
of  our  common stock, or approximately 23% of the issued and outstanding shares
of  Regency.  As a result of the transaction, neither Regency nor Glas-Aire owns
any  stock  of  the  other.

NARRATIVE  DESCRIPTION  OF  BUSINESS.
- ------------------------------------

NATIONAL  RESOURCE  DEVELOPMENT  CORPORATION

NRDC  had  as  its  principal  asset  approximately  70  million  short  tons of
previously quarried and stockpiled rock ("Aggregate") located at the site of the
Groveland  Mine  in  Dickinson County, Michigan. Aggregate is primarily sold for
railroad  ballast,  road  construction,  construction  along  shorelines  and
decorative  uses.  The  market for Aggregate stone is highly competitive and, as
shipping  costs  are  high, the majority of sales, if any, are anticipated to be
made  locally.  Other  companies  that  produce  rock and Aggregate products are
located  in  the  same  region as the Groveland Mine. There are competitors have
greater  financial  and  personnel  resources. As a consequence, there can be no
assurance  that  acting alone, NRDC will be able to consummate sales of material
amounts  of  its  Aggregate.

In  December  2001, the aggregate inventory was sold to Iron Mountain Resources,
Inc., a 75% owned subsidiary of the company.  The purchase price was $18,200,000
and  is  payable,  with  interest  of  2.46%,  in  ninety-six  equal payments of


                                      -4-
<PAGE>
principal  and interest commencing December 2003.  The intercompany gain on this
transaction  has  been  eliminated in the consolidation process resulting in the
aggregate  inventory  being  carried  at  its  historical  cost

Our  Aggregate  is commingled with other aggregate not owned by NRDC and is rock
that  was  separated  from  iron  ore  during  previous  mining  operations. The
ownership  of  the  Aggregate  is  subject  to a Royalty Agreement between North
American  Demolition  Company (International Aggregate Corporation's predecessor
in  title)  and  M.A.  Hanna  Company dated December 22, 1989, as amended, which
requires  the  payment  of certain royalties to M.A. Hanna Company upon sales of
Aggregate.

SECURITY  LAND  AND  DEVELOPMENT  COMPANY  LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP

On  November  18,  1994,  we acquired a limited partnership interest in Security
Land  And  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership (the "Partnership") for an
equity investment of $350,000. We have no obligation to make any further capital
contribution  to  the  Partnership.  The Partnership owns the 34.3-acre Security
West  complex  at  1500  Woodlawn  Drive, Woodlawn, MD consisting of a two-story
office  building  and  a connected six-story office tower occupied by the United
States  Social  Security  Administration  Office of Disability and International
Operations  under a nine-year lease expiring October 31, 2003 (the "Lease"). The
buildings  have  a  net  rentable area of approximately 717,000 square feet. The
construction of the Security West Buildings was completed in 1972 and the Social
Security  Administration has occupied the building since 1972 under prior leases
between  the  U.S.  Government  and  the  Partnership.

During  1994,  the  Partnership  completed  the  placement  of  a  $56,450,000
non-recourse  project  note, due November 15, 2003. The placement of the project
note  was  undertaken by the issuance of 7.90% certificates of participation and
was  underwritten  by Dillon Read & Co., Inc. The net proceeds received from the
sale of the certificates were used to refinance existing debt of the Partnership
related  to  the  project,  to finance certain alterations to the project by the
Partnership,  to  fund  certain  reserves  and  to pay costs of the project note
issue.  The  project note is a non-recourse obligation of the Partnership and is
payable  solely  from  the  Lease payments from the U.S. Government. Such rental
payments  under  the Lease are not subject to annual appropriation by the United
States  Congress  and  accordingly,  the  obligations  to make such payments are
unconditional general obligations of the Government backed by the full faith and
credit  of the United States. The payments under the Lease consist of base rent,
maintenance  rent,  additional  base  rent,  additional maintenance rent and the
government  tax  reimbursement  amount.  The  base  rent,  maintenance  rent and
additional  base  rent  are fixed amounts and are not subject to adjustment. The
base  rent  and  the  additional base rent together constitute the finance rent,
which  will  be  utilized  to  pay  principal  and interest on the project note,
certain  real  estate  taxes  and  costs  of  insurance  and  other  reserves.

The  terms  of  the  Security  Land  And Development Company Limited Partnership
Agreement  (as amended) and the project note (which note will be fully amortized
over  the  term of the lease) call for us to be allocated 95% of the profits and
losses  of  the  Partnership  until  October  31,  2003, and 50% thereafter. The
investment  in  Security  Land  And  Development  Company  Limited  Partnership
Agreement  is  estimated  to  provide  us  with management fees of approximately


                                      -5-
<PAGE>
$100,000  per annum until 2003. In the year ending December 31, 2001, the income
from  our  equity  investment  in  the  Partnership was $5,418,197. These funds,
however,  are  presently  committed  for  the  amortization  of  the outstanding
principal  balance  on Security Land And Development Company Limited Partnership
Agreement  real  estate  mortgage  and,  while  our  investment has increased to
$2,984,078  the  partnership  does  not provide cash flow to us in excess of the
$100,000  annual  management  fee.  The  partnership  agreement provides for the
distribution  of "Sale or Refinancing Proceeds" in accordance with the partner's
positive  tax  capital  account balances. At December 31, 2001, we were the only
partner  with  a  positive  tax  capital  account  balance.

On  November 30, 2000, we invested $10,000 for a 5% Limited Partnership Interest
in 1500 Woodlawn Limited Partnership, the General Partner of Security.  In 2001,
we  earned  $188,268  from  this  investment.

RUSTIC  CRAFTS  INTERNATIONAL,  INC.

Rustic  Crafts  International,  Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Regency, is a
manufacturer  of  decorative  wood and cast marble fireplaces, mantels, shelves,
fireplace  accessories  and  other  home furnishings.  Rustic Crafts employed 26
people  at  December  31,  2001.

In  2001  and 2000 Rustic Crafts generated net sales of approximately $2,407,722
and  $3,313,827  respectively.  Rustic  Crafts  had  Net  (Loss)  Income  before
Management  Fees  of $(510,064) and $150,571 respectively, over the same period.
As of December 31, 2001, Rustic Crafts had approximately $264,000 of open orders
compared  to  approximately  $225,000  in  2000.  Although  orders are generally
subject to termination, we have historically experienced minimal cancellation of
orders.

Rustic Crafts purchases the raw materials used in its manufacturing process from
several suppliers. We believe that there is minimal risk from any termination of
suppliers  and  that  there  are  several suppliers who are capable of supplying
similar  quality  products  at  competitive  prices.

Rustic  Crafts  has  a  number  of  competitors for its products, and management
considers  the  business  to  be  competitive.

GLAS-AIRE  INDUSTRIES  GROUP,  LTD.

Glas-Aire  Industries  Group, LTD. (Glas-Aire), a publicly traded Company, was a
subsidiary  of  Regency.  Glas-Aire  designs,  develops,  manufactures and sells
sunroof  deflectors,  hood  protectors  and  rear air deflectors for cars, light
trucks  and vans. It uses plastics and thermoforming technology to produce these
products.  Glas-Aire's  products  are used in the diverse and growing automotive
components  market,  comprised  of  after-market  accessories,  dealer installed
accessories, car care products and other products purchased by consumers for the
purpose  of  improving  their  vehicles  (versus  those  purchased  for  routine
maintenance).  Glas-Aire  participates  in  the  OEM  segment  of the appearance
accessory  market,  providing products to the automotive manufacturers that then
distribute  the  products  to consumers through their dealer networks. Glas-Aire
employs  approximately  208  persons.


                                      -6-
<PAGE>
On  October  1,  2001,  we announced that we had completed a transaction for the
disposing  of  our interest in Glas-Aire.  Pursuant to an agreement entered into
on  September  17,  2001  and amended on October 1, 2001, we exchanged 1,215,105
shares  of  common  stock  of  Glas-Aire,  representing approximately 50% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Glas-Aire, for $2,500,000 plus 4,040,375 shares
of  our  common stock, or approximately 23% of the issued and outstanding shares
of  Regency.  As a result of the transaction, neither Regency nor Glas-Aire owns
any  stock  of  the  other  at  December  31,  2001

Glas-Aire  generated  net  sales  of $8,378,202 for the nine-month period ending
September  30, 2001.  Income before income from equity investment and income tax
expense  was  $449,040  over  the  same  period.  Glas-Aire had been included in
Regency's  consolidated  financial  statements effective September 23, 1999 (the
date  that  we  acquired 51.3% control of Glas-Aire) through September 30, 2001.

As  of December 31, 2001, Regency and its subsidiaries employed approximately 28
people.

REGTRANSCO,  INC.

RegTransco,  Inc. (RTI) has two classes of outstanding common stock, Class A and
Class  B.  There  are  20,000  shares of Class common stocks outstanding, all of
which  are  owned  by  Drilling  (an 80% owned subsidiary of Regency Affiliates,
Inc.).  Five  thousand (5,000) shares of Class B common stock were issued to the
Original  Investors  who financed the our Chapter XI filing in 1986 and 1987 and
represented  20%  of the voting power of RTI's outstanding common stock. As part
of  the  1992 Restructuring, the holders of the Class B stock returned their 20%
interest  as a group to RTI. RTI's Class A and Class B common stock are equal to
each  other  in  all  respects  except dividend preference. Holders of shares of
Class  A  and  Class  B  common  stock are entitled to one vote per share in the

Speed.com  is  a wholly owned subsidiary of Regency Affiliates, Inc.  Previously
this  entity  was  involved  in  the  purchase of Glas Aire.  This entity has no
current  operations.

IRON  MOUNTAIN  RESOURCES,  INC.

In  December  2001, the aggregate inventory was sold to Iron Mountain Resources,
Inc., a 75% owned subsidiary of the company.  The purchase price was $18,200,000
and  is  payable,  with  interest  of  2.46%,  in  ninety-six  equal payments of
principal  and interest commencing December 2003.  The intercompany gain on this

transaction  has  been  eliminated in the consolidation process resulting in the
aggregate  inventory  being  carried  at  its  historical  cost.


ITEM  2.     PROPERTIES

The  Partnership  owns  the  Security  West  Building  at  1500  Woodlawn Drive,
Woodlawn,  MD.

In  March 1998, Rustic Craft purchased a 117,000 square foot building located at
40  Poplar  Street  in  Scranton,  Pennsylvania.  The building was renovated and
occupied  in  early  1999.  Approximately 14,000 square feet in this building is
leased  to another tenant. The manufacturing operation uses approximately 75,000
square  feet  of the building.  This facility should satisfy Rustic Crafts needs
for  the  foreseeable  future.

ITEM  3.     LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS

On February 7, 2002 a complaint naming Regency Affiliates, Inc. as Defendant was
filed  in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska, case number 1012.  The
Plaintiffs  are Larry J. Horbach, individually and L.J. Horbach & Associates and
they  are demanding payment on a Regency Affiliates loan they purchased from Mid
City  Bank.  The  plaintiffs  are  requesting payment of $82,512.57 plus accrued
interest,  costs and attorney fees.  We are vigorously defending this litigation
and  had  previously commenced litigation regarding the same subject in December
2001.

On  December  14,  2001  we  initiated  a proceeding in The Circuit Court of the
Nineteenth  Judicial  Circuit  in  and  for  Martin County, Florida, case number
01-1087-CA against Larry J. Horbach, individually and L.J. Horbach & Associates.
Larry  Horbach  was  a former interim CFO and Board member.  We claim that Larry
Horbach,  without appropriate authority, borrowed $100,050 from Mid City Bank in
the name of Regency.  We further claim that Horbach converted all or part of the
proceeds  from  the  loan  for  his  benefit.

On  September 13, 2001, Glas Aire Industries LTD., Multicorp Holdings Inc., Glas
Aire  Industries  Group  Ltd,  Craig  Grossman,  Todd  Garrett, Speed.Com, Inc.,
Regency  Affiliates,  Inc.,  William Ponsoldt, and Marc Baldinger were listed as
defendants in a proceeding in the Supreme Court of British Columbia with Alex Y.
W.  Ding  as  plaintiff.   The  case  number  is  S015104.  Mr. Ding, the former
president  of  Glas-Aire,  has  asserted that the October 2001 Regency-Glas-Aire
transaction is in breach of bank agreements, securities law and fiduciary duties
owed  to  Glas-Aire  and  its  stockholders.  While the company has been served,
plaintiff  has  not  proceeded  on  this action and has not filed a statement of
claim  on  a  timely  basis.  Should  plaintiff  continue  with  the action, the
defendants,  including  Regency,  would  vigorously  defend  this  litigation

ISSUANCE  OF  UNREGISTERED  SECURITIES.

Effective  June  3, 1997, we issued 466,667 shares of Common Stock at a value of
$233,333  and  options  to  purchase  an additional 6.1 million shares of Common
Stock  to  Statesman  Group,  Inc.

On  October  15,  2001,  Statesman  exercised  the option in full pursuant to an
agreement  that  (1) provided for a purchase price at $.40 per share (par value)
rather  than  the  formula  price  in  the  option,  which  would  have  yielded
approximately  25%  less and (2) provided for collateral for the $2.44 million 5
year  note  issued by Statesman to Regency (in addition to the shares purchased)
in  the  form  of the 20% stock interest owned by Statesman in National Resource
Development  Corporation,  our  80%  owned  subsidiary.

BEYOND  OUR CONTROL.  AS A RESULT, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM
THOSE  RESULTS CONTEMPLATED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHICH INCLUDE BUT
ARE  NOT  LIMITED  TO:

     (i)  WE  CURRENTLY  DO  NOT  GENERATE  POSITIVE  CASH  FLOW  AS OUR CURRENT
          ACTIVITIES DO NOT, IN AND OF THEMSELVES, GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW
          TO COVER OUR CORPORATE OPERATING EXPENSES AND THUS WE MUST RELY ON OUR
          CASH  RESERVES  TO  FUND  THESE  EXPENSES.  OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE IN
          EXISTENCE  IS PARTLY DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO ATTAIN SATISFACTORY
          LEVELS  OF  OPERATING  CASH  FLOWS.


    (ii)  WE  CURRENTLY  LACK  THE  NECESSARY INFRA STRUCTURE AT THE SITE OF THE
          GROVELAND MINE IN ORDER TO PERMIT US TO MAKE MORE THAN CASUAL SALES OF
          THE  AGGREGATE.

   (iii)  AN  UNSECURED  DEFAULT  IN  THE  LEASE  OR SUDDEN CATASTROPHE  TO  THE
          SECURITY  WEST BUILDING FROM UNINSURED ACTS OF GOD OR WAR COULD HAVE A
          MATERIALLY  ADVERSE  IMPACT  UPON  OUR INVESTMENT IN SECURITY LAND AND
          DEVELOPMENT  COMPANY  LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP AND THEREFORE ITS FINANCIAL
          POSITION  AND  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS.

    (IV)  THE  FAILURE  OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION TO RENEW ITS LEASE
          OF THE SECURITY WEST BUILDINGS UPON ITS EXPIRATION ON OCTOBER 31, 2003
          COULD  HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT UPON OUR INVESTMENT IN SECURITY LAND AND
          DEVELOPMENT  COMPANY  LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP.

          PROSPECTIVELY,  OF SUCH CARRYFORWARDS, DUE TO OWNERSHIP CHANGES OR ANY
          OTHER REASON. THE DISALLOWANCE OF THE UTILIZATION OF OUR NET OPERATING
          LOSS  WOULD  SEVERELY  IMPACT  OUR  FINANCIAL  POSITION AND RESULTS OF
          OPERATIONS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF TAXABLE INCOME (GENERATED
          BY  OUR  INVESTMENT  IN  SECURITY)  THAT  HAS IN THE PAST BEEN, AND IS

GENERAL

We are the parent of several subsidiary business operations. We are committed to
develop  and/or  monetize  these  business  operations  for  the  benefit of our
shareholders and continue to commit both financial and personnel resources to an
active  merger  and acquisition program in order to enhance common shareholders'
values.

Our  Shareholders'  Equity  at  December 31, 2001 was $19,878,174 as compared to
$16,076,052  on  December  31,  2000,  an  increase  of  19.13%.


                                      -13-
<PAGE>
LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES.

The  investment  in  Security is estimated to provide us with management fees of
approximately  $100,000  per  annum  until 2003. In the years ended December 31,
2001,  December  31,  2000,  December  31,  1999,  our  income  from  the equity
investment  in  the  Partnership  was  $5,418,197,  $4,712,615,  and $4,261,212,
respectively. These funds, however, are presently committed for the amortization
of  the  outstanding  principal  balance on Security's real estate mortgage and,
while  our  equity investment has increased to $29,984,078, the partnership does
not provide liquidity to us in excess of the $100,000 annual management fee. The
partnership  agreement  provides  for  the  distribution of "Sale or Refinancing
Proceeds"  in  accordance  with  the  partner's  positive  tax  capital  account
balances.  At  December  31,  2001, we were the only partner with a positive tax
capital  account  balance.  We  have  been  previously  successful  in obtaining
financing  with  respect  to  this  partnership interest to fund our acquisition
program  and  cash  flow  deficits.

Following  the  termination  of  the 1999 NRDC Plan of Merger with Cotton Valley
Resources  Corporation,  we  installed  limited Aggregate crushing and marketing
operations  at  the  Groveland  Mine  in  an informal joint venture with another
company.  Pending the outcome of current discussions regarding the possible sale
of the our interest, we also continue to explore the possibility of establishing
a permanent infrastructure to commercialize the inventory of previously quarried
and  stockpiled Aggregate at the Groveland Mine. In December 2001, the aggregate
inventory  was  sold to Iron Mountain Resources, Inc., a 75% owned subsidiary of
the  company.  The  purchase price was $18,200,000 and is payable, with interest
of  2.46%,  in  ninety-six  equal  payments of principal and interest commencing
December 2003.  The intercompany gain on this transaction has been eliminated in
the  consolidation process resulting in the aggregate inventory being carried at
it's  historical  cost.

We sold 2,852,375 shares of our common stock to Glas-Aire for cash of $1,967,960
and 86,000 shares of Glas-Aire common stock. The proceeds were used to repay the
funding  provided  by  an  affiliate  of  Statesman  and other general corporate
requirements.

We  continue  to explore opportunities to acquire companies with operations that
will  provide  additional  liquidity  and cash flow.  Our ability to continue in
existence  is partly dependent upon our ability to attain satisfactory levels of
operating  cash  flows  and  our  ability  to  continue  borrowing.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2001 COMPARED TO 2000

Net  sales  decreased  $3,456,848  compared  to  2000, a 24% decrease. Net sales
included  $8,378,202  of  Glas-Aire  sales  through September 30, 2001, when the
investment  in  Glas Aire was disposed. Sales of household accessories decreased
by  $903,028  due  to  general economic conditions, the effects of September 11,
2001, and a reduction in the purchases of a large retail customer. Rustic Crafts
continues  to  emphasize higher margin sales in 2001, has begun diversifying its
product  line,  and  has  reduced its reliance on its single large customer, who
required  discounted  prices.


                                      -14-
<PAGE>
Gross  margins  decreased  $1,273,429  in  2001  over  2000,  which is primarily
attributable  to the disposition of Glas-Aire and its inclusion in the company's
financial  statements  through  only  September  30, 2001. Gross margins of home
accessories  decreased  $437,441  in  2001  reflecting  the  softer  economic
conditions,  and  a  reduced  reliance  on  its  single  largest  customer.

Selling  and  administrative  expenses  were  reduced by $18,467 or 3.4% in 2001
compared  to  2000.  Increases  in  professional  fees  were  offset  by similar
reductions  attributable  closing  the  Omaha  office  and  removal of Glas-Aire
activities  from  September  30,  2001.  Expenses  increased at Rustic Crafts by
$57,132  as  a result of an increase in spending for Research and Development to
diversify  into  other  product lines and higher costs of selling and marketing.

Income from equity investment in partnership increased $705,582 over 2000 due to
the  reduction  of  interest expenses on the lower loan principal balance of the
partnership.

Interest  expense  increased  by $94,197 in 2001 over 2000 as a result of higher
loan  balances  at  Rustic  Crafts  and  of  Regency.

Income  tax  expense  decreased  $58,082  due  to  lower  income tax expense for
Glas-Aire.  Regency  cannot use its net operating loss to offset the earnings of
Glas  Aire.

Minority  interest  in  the  Statement  of  Operations  decreased  $118,045  due
primarily  to  the  elimination  of  the  results  of  operations  of Glas-Aire.

Net income increased $1,518,428 or 70.5% in 2001 over 2000. The increase was due
to  the  recognition  of a gain in 2001 resulting from the sale of Glas-Aire and
increased  partnership earnings reduced by losses at Rustic Craft. Income before
extraordinary  gain  increased  $192,197  or  9.8%  in  2000  over  1999.

2000  COMPARED  TO  1999

Net  sales  increased  $6,507,542  over 1999, an 83% increase. Net sales include
$10,929,775  of  Glas-Aire  sales.  Sales  of household accessories decreased by
$485,286  due to general economic conditions resulting in a decline in sales and
a  reduction in backlog orders from the previous period. Rustic Crafts continues
to  emphasized  higher  margin  sales in 2000 and to reduce its reliance on it's
single  large  customer,  who  requires  discounted  prices.

Gross  margins  increased  $2,050,695  in  2000  over  1999,  which is primarily
attributable to the acquisition of Glas-Aire and it's inclusion in the company's
financial  statements  for  the  entire  year. Gross margins of home accessories
increased  $196,200  in  2000  reflecting  the  Company's focus on higher margin
products.

Selling and administrative expenses increased $1,960,385 or 58% in 2000 compared
to 1999 The increase is attributable to the inclusion in the companies financial
statement  of  Glas-Aire  activities  for the entire year. Expenses increased at
Rustic  Crafts by $214,842 as a result of higher costs of selling and marketing,
including  the  compensation  of  key  employees.

<PAGE>
Income from equity investment in partnership increased $451,403 over 1999 due to
the  reduction  of  interest expenses on the lower loan principal balance of the
partnership,  partially  offset  by  increased  operating  and  administrative
expenses.

Other income decreased $91,085 in 2000 as compared to 1999. Other income in 1999
includes  $114,960  of  equity  earnings  related  to the Company's ownership in
Glas-Aire  prior  to  September  1999.  These  earnings were offset by decreased
interest  income  from  declining  invested  cash  balances.

Interest  expense  decreased $12,421 in 2000 from 1999 as a result of lower cost
of  funds.  Interest expense in 1998 included significant costs and penalties in
connection  with  the refinancing of the SIPI loan in June 1998. The elimination
of  the refinancing costs was partially offset by additional loans for equipment
and  facilities  at  Rustic  Crafts  and the higher loan balance of the KBC loan
which  refinanced  the  SIPI  loan.

Income  tax  expense increased $190,984 due to income tax expense for Glas-Aire.
The Company cannot use its net operating loss to offset the earnings of this 51%
owned  subsidiary.

Minority interest in the Statement of Operations increased $79,128 due primarily
to  the inclusion of the results of operations of Glas-Aire for the full year of
2000.

Net  income  decreased $137,668 or 6% in 2000 over 1999. The decrease was due to
the  recognition  of  an extraordinary gain in 1999. Income before extraordinary
gain  increased  $192,937  or  9.8%  in  2000  over  1999.

ITEM  7A.     QUANTITATIVE  AND  QUALITATIVE  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT  MARKET  RISK

We  are  exposed  to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest
rates.  We  do  not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our
debt  securities. We have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments and
we  do  not  transact  business  in  foreign  currencies.

The  fair  value of our cash and cash equivalents or related income would not be
significantly  impacted  by  changes  in  interest  rates  since  the investment
maturities are short. Debt from drawdowns on our lines of credit incurs interest
at  the  Prime  Lending  Rate,  which  would  change  from  time  to  time.

It  is  not  possible  to  anticipate the level of interest rates going forward.
Changes in interest rates have little impact as the majority of our debt is at a
fixed  interest  rate.

such  requirements  on  a  timely  basis.

     (1)  The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") requires disclosure
          of  the potential realizable value or present value of each grant. The
          5% and 10% assumed annual rates of compounded stock price appreciation
          are  mandated  by  rules of the SEC and do not represent the Company's
          estimate  or  projection  of the Company's future common stock prices.
          The  disclosure assumes the options will be held for the full six year
          term prior to exercise. Such options may be exercised prior to the end
          of  such six-year term. The actual value, if any, an executive officer
          may  realize  will  depend  on  the excess of the stock price over the
          exercise  price  on  the date the option is exercised. There can be no

rules  of  the  SEC and do not represent the Company's estimate or projection of
the  Company's  future  common stock prices.  The disclosure assumes the options
will  be held for the full six-year term prior to exercise.  Such options may be
exercised  prior to the end of such six-year term.  The actual value, if any, an
executive  officer may realize will depend on the excess of the stock price over
the  exercise  price  on  the  date  the  option  is exercised.  There can be no
assurance  that the stock price will appreciate at the rates shown in the table.

INCENTIVE  STOCK  OPTION  PLANS

The  Company  has reserved 500,000 shares of its Common Stock for issuance under
the  1988  Incentive  Stock Plan.  There are no options to purchase Common Stock
outstanding  under  this  plan.

Stock  Options  Granted  to  Statesman  Group,  Inc.

The  Statesman  Group,  Inc.  is an international business corporation organized
under  the  laws of the Bahamas. Statesman's principal business is the making of
investments in the United States and elsewhere.  Both its principal business and
principal  office  are  located  at  Bay Street, Nassau, Bahamas.  The Statesman
Irrevocable  Trust  dated April 15, 1991 is the controlling person of Statesman.
The  Statesman  Trust  is  an  irrevocable  trust  for the benefit of William R.
Ponsoldt,  Jr.,  a  director  of  Regency,  Tracey  A. Ponsoldt, now married and
sometimes  known  as Tracey A. Powers, and Christopher J. Ponsoldt, all children
of  William  R.  Ponsoldt, Sr. The acting trustees of the Statesman Trust, dated
April  15,  1991,  have  the  sole  right to control the disposition of and vote
Regency's  securities  acquired  by  Statesman

Pursuant  to  an  Agreement dated June 3, 1997, as amended and restated on March
24,  1998,  Statesman  Group,  Inc.  was granted options to purchase 6.1 million
shares  of  Common  Stock.  Statesman owned approximately 25% of our outstanding
common  stock prior to the issuance of these options. The options were issued to
Statesman  in  order  to  secure  the release of Mr. William R. Ponsoldt, Sr. to
serve as our President and Chief Executive Officer and to recognize in part, the
amendment  to  the Series C Preferred Shares under which Statesman forfeited the


                                      -20-
<PAGE>
common  stock  conversion  rights with respect thereto. Statesman also agreed to
provide  loan  guarantees  not to exceed the sum of $300,000 upon the request of
Regency  and  a  showing of reasonable need. In 2001, we accessed and repaid the
line  of  credit from Statesman. The loans had been collateralized with holdings
of  Glas-Aire  Stock owned by Regency. Statesman and/or its affiliated interests
have  provided loan guarantees and/or unsecured prime interest rate direct loans
to  Regency  exceeding  $2,000,000  since June 1997. Pursuant to the Amended and
Restated  Agreement  between  Regency  and  Statesman,  until  their  date  of
expiration,  the  options  were exercisable at any time in whole or in part at a
price  equal to the lower of (a) the closing trading price as of the most recent
date  on  which  at  least  10,000  shares of such stock were traded, or (b) the
average  closing  trading  price  of  the  shares  during  the ninety day period
immediately  preceding  the  date  of  exercise. We agreed to reserve sufficient
shares  to  meet the requirements of the options. The options became exercisable
immediately  and  remained  exercisable  until  April 15, 2007. At the option of
Statesman,  payment could and was made by Statesman for exercise of the options,
in  whole,  in the form of a promissory note executed by Statesman, secured only
by a pledge of the shares purchased, which promissory note would accrue interest
for  any  quarter  at the prime rate in effect on the last day of the quarter at
Chase  Manhattan  Bank, with interest and principal payable in a balloon payment
five  years  after the date of execution of the note, provided that if our Board
of  Directors reasonably determines that exercising the options by delivery of a
note  would  render the respective purchase of shares void or voidable, then the
Board  may  require,  as  a condition to exercise of the options, that Statesman
either  (i)  pay  at least the par value of the shares in cash (with the balance
paid  by  delivery  of a note), or (ii) provide acceptable collateral other than
the  shares  themselves  to  secure  payment  of  the note.  We received no cash
consideration  with  respect  to the issuance of the securities to Statesman, no
commissions  were  paid, and no underwriter was involved. The options granted to
Statesman  have  no  readily  determinable  value  and,  therefore,  we have not
recognized  any  costs  associated  with  the  issuance  of  these  options.

At  a  meeting of our Board of Directors on December 3, 2000, Statesman notified
us  that  it  intended  to exercise its option.  The Board formed a committee to
negotiate  for  collateral  for the note that Statesman was entitled to issue to
exercise the option.  The committee also obtained independent expert advice with
respect  to  the  transaction.

On  October  15,  2001,  Statesman  exercised  the option in full pursuant to an
agreement  that  (1) provided for a purchase price at $.40 per share (par value)
rather  than  the  formula  price  in  the  option,  which would have yielded us
approximately  25%  less and (2) provided for collateral for the $2.44 million 5
year  note  issued by Statesman to Regency (in addition to the shares purchased)
in  the  form  of the 20% stock interest owned by Statesman in National Resource
Development  Corporation,  our  80%  owned  subsidiary.

Non Qualified Stock Options.

Non qualified options to acquire a total of 70,000 common shares were granted in
2001  to  directors  of  Regency  in accordance with the Directors' compensation
program as approved by the Shareholders in the 1999 Meeting of Shareholders. The
options  were granted at an exercise price of $0.40 per share, respectively, the
par  value  of  the common shares at date of grant. The options vest on February
5,2002  and  are  exercisable  to  August  5,  2006.

LTIP Awards.

There  have  been  no  awards under any Long-Term Incentive Plan during the last
completed  fiscal  year.

Defined Benefit Plans.

We have no defined benefit or actuarial plans.

Compensation of Directors.

At  the  1999  Meeting  of Shareholders held on August 5, 1999, the Shareholders
approved  a  compensation  program  for  directors  providing  for (i) an annual
retainer  for all directors of $10,000, payable one-half in cash and one-half in
our  Common  Stock,  (ii)  a  fee  of  $125/hour,  with  a two hour minimum, for
attendance  at  each  meeting  of  the Board or committee thereof, provided that
multi-day  meetings  and  specific  consultations  with our executive management
lasting  at least eight hours are compensated on a flat per diem rate of $1,000,
and  (iii)  an  award of an option to all directors to purchase 10,000 shares of
our  Common  Stock,  at  fair  market  value  on  date  of  grant.

Other Arrangements.

Martin  J.  Craffey was paid $7,400 for consulting primarily with respect to the
operations of Rustic Crafts International, Inc. There were no other arrangements
pursuant  to which any director was compensated during our last completed fiscal
year  for  services  provided  as  a  director.

EMPLOYMENT  CONTRACTS,  TERMINATION  OF  EMPLOYMENT  AND  CHANGE  IN  CONTROL
ARRANGEMENTS.

On  June  3, 1997, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with William
R.  Ponsoldt,  Sr. pursuant to which he became the President and Chief Executive
Officer  of the Company.  The Agreement provides for Mr. Ponsoldt to continue in
these duties until his attainment of retirement age, provided that he may resign
upon 30 days notice to the Company and further provided that Mr. Ponsoldt may be
removed  from  office upon death or disability or for just cause.  The Agreement
provides for a base salary in annual installments, in advance, of $250,000 each,
which  salary is to be adjusted on January 1 of every year by any increase since
the  previous  January  1  in  the  Consumer  Price  Index ("CPI") for All Urban
Consumers,  U.S.  city  average,  as  published by the U.S. Department of Labor,


                                      -22-
<PAGE>
Bureau  of Labor Statistics.  As additional compensation, payable on a quarterly
basis,  Mr.  Ponsoldt  is  to  receive  an  amount equal to 20% of the Company's
increase  in  quarterly  common  stock  net  worth,  which  is defined to be the
difference  between  (i)  total  shareholders' equity and (ii) any shareholders'
equity  accounts  relating to preferred stock.  Mr. Ponsoldt may elect to have a
portion  of his salary or additional compensation in the form of (i) a qualified
pension plan; (ii) a qualified profit sharing plan; or (iii) life insurance with
a  beneficiary  of  his  choice.  The  Company may elect to pay up to 50% of the
additional  compensation  by  the issuance of warrants to purchase the Company's
Common  Stock at a price equal to 50% of the average bid price for the Company's
Common  Stock  for  the calendar quarter for which the increased compensation is
payable.  At Mr. Ponsoldt's option, payment for the exercise of the warrants, in
whole  or  in  part,  may  be made in the form of a promissory note secured by a
pledge of the shares purchased.  The Agreement further provides for Mr. Ponsoldt
to  receive  health  and  disability  insurance (with a benefit of $100,000/year
payable  in  the  event  of  long  term  disability), an automobile allowance of
$600/month  (to  be  adjusted  by  increases  in  the CPI), and reimbursement of
expenses.  The  Agreement  provides  that Mr. Ponsoldt will not compete with the
Company  for  a two year period following the termination of his employment.  In
addition,  the  Company  agrees  to  indemnify  Mr.  Ponsoldt  under  certain
circumstances.  Any  disputes  between  the  Company  and Mr. Ponsoldt under the
Agreement  are  to  be  resolved  through  arbitration.

(4)  The  shareholder's most recent Schedule 13D, filed on June 5, 1998, reports

However,  based  on the number of shares owned by the shareholder as reported in
the  Schedule  13D  and  the  number  of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the
Company  believes  the  shareholder holds less than 5% of the outstanding Common
Stock.

ITEM  13.  CERTAIN  RELATIONSHIPS  AND  RELATED  TRANSACTIONS.

STATESMAN  GROUP,  INC.  OPTIONS

Statesman  Group,  Inc.  ("Statesman")  is an international business corporation
organized  under  the laws of the Bahamas. Statesman's principal business is the
making  of  investments  in the United States and elsewhere.  Both its principal
business  and  principal office are located at Bay Street, Nassau, Bahamas.  The
Statesman  Irrevocable Trust, dated April 15, 1991, is the controlling person of
Statesman.  The  Statesman  Trust  is  an  irrevocable  trust for the benefit of
William  R.  Ponsoldt,  Jr.,  a director of the Company, Tracey A. Ponsoldt, now
married  and  sometimes  known as Tracey A. Powers, and Christopher J. Ponsoldt,
all  children  of  William R. Ponsoldt, Sr. The acting trustees of the Statesman
Trust is Liedenhall Bank and Trust, Nassau, Bahamas, which has the sole right to
control  the  disposition  of  and  vote  the  Company's  securities acquired by
Statesman.


                                      -24-
<PAGE>
Pursuant  to  an  Agreement dated June 3, 1997, as amended and restated on March
24,  1998,  Statesman  Group,  Inc.  was granted options to purchase 6.1 million
shares  of  Common  Stock.  Statesman  owned  approximately 25% of the Company's
outstanding  common  stock  prior to the issuance of these options.  The options
were  issued  to  Statesman  in  order  to  secure the release of Mr. William R.
Ponsoldt,  Sr. to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
for  the release of certain contractual rights held by Statesman, for assignment
of certain rights of first refusal and for other consideration.  Pursuant to the
Amended  and  Restated  Agreement between the Company and Statesman, until their
date of expiration, the options were exercisable at any time in whole or in part
at  a  price  equal to the lower of (a) the closing trading price as of the most
recent  date  on  which at least 10,000 shares of such stock were traded, or (b)
the  average  closing  trading  price of the shares during the ninety day period
immediately  preceding  the  date  of  exercise.  The options became exercisable
immediately  and were to remain exercisable until April 15, 2007.  At the option
of Statesman, payment could be made by Statesman for exercise of the options, in
whole  or  in  part,  in  the  form  of a promissory note executed by Statesman,
secured  only  by  a pledge of the shares purchased, which promissory note would
accrue  interest  for any quarter at the prime rate in effect on the last day of
the  quarter  at  Chase Manhattan Bank, with interest and principal payable in a
balloon  payment  five  years  after the date of execution of the note, provided
that  if  the Company's Board of Directors reasonably determined that exercising
the options by delivery of a note would render the respective purchase of shares
void  or  voidable,  then the Board could require, as a condition to exercise of
the  options, that Statesman either (i) pay at least the par value of the shares
in  cash  (with  the  balance  paid  by  delivery  of  a  note), or (ii) provide
acceptable  collateral other than the shares themselves to secure payment of the
note.

At  a  meeting  of  Regency's  Board of Directors on December 3, 2000, Statesman
notified  the  Company  that  it  intended to exercise its option.  The Board of
Directors  formed  a  committee  to  negotiate  for collateral for the note that
Statesman  was  entitled  to  issue  to exercise the option.  The committee also
obtained  independent  expert  advice  with  respect  to  the  transaction.

On  October  15,  2001,  Statesman  exercised  the option in full pursuant to an
agreement  that  (1) provided for a purchase price at $.40 per share (par value)
rather  than  the  formula  price  in  the  option, which would have yielded the
Company  approximately  25%  less  and (2) provided for collateral for the $2.44
million  5  year  note  issued  by  Statesman to the Company (in addition to the
shares  purchased)  in  the form of the 20% stock interest owned by Statesman in
National  Resource  Development Corporation, the Company's 80% owned subsidiary.
As  a result of the transaction the Statesman Group owns approximately 38.2 % of
our  stock.

In  addition,  pursuant  to  the  Amended and Restated Agreement, Statesman also
agreed  to  provide  loan  guarantees not to exceed the sum of $300,000 upon the
request  of  the  Company  and  a  showing  of  reasonable need. The Company has
accessed the Statesman loan.  The loan is a demand loan which was collateralized
by  the  Glas-Aire  Stock  held by the Company.  Statesman and/or its affiliated
interests  have  provided  loan  guarantees and/or unsecured prime interest rate


                                      -25-
<PAGE>
direct  loans  to  the  Company  in excess of $2,000,000 since June 1997.  As of
October  2,  2001,  the  balances  of  such  loans  have  been  paid  in  full.

DISPOSITION OF OUR INTEREST IN GLAS AIRE

On  September  17, 2001, the Company completed a transaction for the disposition
of  its  interest  in its partially owned subsidiary, Glas-Aire Industries Group
Ltd.  ("Glas-Aire").  Prior  to  the  transaction,  each  corporation  owned  a
substantial  percentage  of  the common stock of the other, and they had certain
officers  and  directors  in  common.  Pursuant  to an agreement entered into on
September  17,  2001 and amended on October 1, 2001, Regency exchanged 1,215,105
shares  of  common  stock  of  Glas-Aire,  representing approximately 50% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Glas-Aire, for $2,500,000 plus 4,040,375 shares
of  Regency's  common  stock, or approximately 23% of the issued and outstanding
shares  of  Regency.  As  a  result  of  the  transaction,  neither  Regency nor
Glas-Aire  owns  any  stock  of  the  other.

The exchange rate was based on negotiations between the parties and confirmed as
to  fairness  by  independent valuation firms, hired by respective committees of
each  of  the  Boards  of  Directors  of  Regency  and  Glas-Aire.

The  former president of Glas-Aire has commenced litigation in British Columbia,
Canada  against  Glas-Aire,  the  Company, Mr. Ponsoldt and Mr. Baldinger, among
other  things,  asserting that the Regency-Glas-Aire transaction is in breach of
bank  agreements,  securities law and fiduciary duties owed to Glas-Aire and its
stockholders.  While the company has been served, plaintiff has not proceeded on
this  action  and  has not filed a statement of claim on a timely basis.  Should
plaintiff  continue  with  the  action, the defendants, including Regency, would
vigorously  defend  this  litigation

WILLIAM  R.  PONSOLDT'S,  SR.  EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT

Mr.  Ponsoldt's  employment  agreement  provides for Mr. Ponsoldt to continue in
these duties until his attainment of retirement age, provided that he may resign
upon  30 days notice to us and further provided that Mr. Ponsoldt may be removed
from  office upon death or disability or for just cause.  The Agreement provides
for  a  base  salary in annual installments, in advance, of $250,000 each, which
salary  is  to  be adjusted on January 1 of every year by any increase since the
previous  January 1 in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") for All Urban Consumers,
U.S. city average, as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
Statistics.  As  additional  compensation,  payable  on  a  quarterly basis, Mr.
Ponsoldt  is  to  receive  an  amount  equal to 20% of our increase in quarterly
common  stock net worth, which is defined to be the difference between (i) total
shareholders'  equity  and  (ii)  any  shareholders' equity accounts relating to
preferred  stock.  Mr.  Ponsoldt  may  elect  to have a portion of his salary or
additional  compensation  in  the  form  of (i) a qualified pension plan; (ii) a
qualified profit sharing plan; or (iii) life insurance with a beneficiary of his
choice.  We  may  elect  to  pay up to 50% of the additional compensation by the
issuance of warrants to purchase our Common Stock at a price equal to 50% of the
average  bid  price  for our Common Stock for the calendar quarter for which the
increased  compensation is payable.  William Ponsoldt had accrued payment of his
salary and bonus until October 2001.  On that date, Regency had paid his salary,


                                      -26-
<PAGE>
bonus, and accrued interest of $1,355,00.  At Mr. Ponsoldt's option, payment for
the  exercise of the warrants, in whole or in part, may be made in the form of a
promissory  note  secured  by  a  pledge of the shares purchased.  The Agreement
further  provides  for  Mr.  Ponsoldt to receive health and disability insurance
(with  a benefit of $100,000/year payable in the event of long term disability),
an  automobile allowance of $600/month (to be adjusted by increases in the CPI),
and  reimbursement  of  expenses.  The Agreement provides that Mr. Ponsoldt will
not  compete  with  us  for  a  two-year period following the termination of his
employment.  In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Mr. Ponsoldt under certain
circumstances.  Any  disputes  between the parties under the Agreement are to be
resolved  through  arbitration.

                          Independent Auditor's Report


To  the  Board  of  Directors  and  Stockholders
of  Regency  Affiliates,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries


We  have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Regency Affiliates, Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as  of  December  31,  2001and  2000  and the related consolidated
statements  of  operations,  changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
the  years  then  ended.  These  consolidated  financial  statements  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.

We  conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in  the  United  States  of  America.  Those  standards require that we plan and
perform  the  audit  to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable  basis  for  our  opinion.

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Regency
Affiliates,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  as  of  December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the
results of its consolidated operations, changes in shareholder's equity and cash
flows  for  the  years  then  ended  in  conformity  with  accounting principles
generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

          A.   Principals of Consolidation and Nature of Business - The
               consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regency
               Affiliates, Inc. (the "Company"), its wholly owned subsidiaries,
               Rustic Crafts International, Inc. ("Rustic Crafts"), and
               Speed.com, Inc., it's 75% owned subsidiary, Iron Mountain
               Minerals, Inc. ("IMM") since December 13, 2001, its 80% owned
               subsidiaries, National Resource Development Corporation ("NRDC"),
               Transcontinental Drilling Company ("Drilling") and RegTransco,
               Inc. ("RTI") and its 50% owned subsidiary, Glas-Aire Industries
               Group, Ltd. ("Glas-Aire") from September 23, 1999, the date in
               which the Company achieved an ownership interest greater than 50%
               through October 1, 2001, the date this interest was disposed of.
               All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
               eliminated in consolidation.

               The Company is engaged in multiple business activities (See
               Note 16).

               Regency Affiliates, Inc.'s share of consolidated net assets at
               December 31, 2001 and 2000 consists principally of cash and cash
               equivalents of approximately $280,000 and $12,000 respectively,
               investment in partnerships of approximately $30,183,200 and
               $24,576,000, respectively, property, plant and equipment of
               approximately $19,600 and $27,300, respectively, and liabilities
               of approximately $12,100,000 and $12,303,000, respectively.

          B.   Revenue Recognition - The Company's subsidiaries recognize
               revenue from the sale of goods upon shipment to their respective
               customers.

          C.   Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per share are computed by
               dividing net income attributable to common shareholders (net
               income less preferred stock dividend requirements and periodic
               accretion if applicable) by the weighted average number of common
               shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share
               computations assume the conversion of Series E, Series B, and
               Junior Series D preferred stock during the period that the
               preferred stock issues were outstanding. If the result of these
               assumed conversions is dilutive, the dividend requirements and
               periodic accretion for the preferred stock issues are reduced
               (See Note 9).

               The weighted average number of shares used in basic earnings per
               share computations for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was approximately
               17,547,161 and 13,085,106 and 12,664,000, respectively. The
               weighted average number of shares used in the computation of
               diluted earnings per share for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was
               approximately 20,439,524, 14,864,004 and 14,923,000,
               respectively. The Company's stock was thinly traded in the
               over-the-counter market on the bulletin board section until late
               1999. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, market prices of $.256, $.587 and
               $.984 per share, respectively, were utilized in the conversion
               formulas for the computation of diluted earnings per share. In
               2001, 2000 and 1999, if market prices of $.230, $.406 per share,
               and $.563 per share, respectively, the lowest bid price of the
               Company's common shares during the year, were used in the
               conversion formulas, the weighted average number of shares
               utilized in the computation of diluted earnings per share would
               amount to approximately 20,551,994, 15,061,106 and 15,435,000,
               respectively, yielding diluted earnings per share of $.18, $.14
               and $.15, respectively.

Note 1.   Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies  (Continued)

          C.   Earnings  Per  Share  (Continued)

               Earnings per common share attributable to extraordinary gain (net
               of tax) for 1999 are: Earnings per common share - basic of $.03
               and earning per common share - diluted of $.02.

          D.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The fair values of cash,
               accounts receivable, accounts payable and other short-term
               obligations approximate their carrying values because of the
               short maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying
               values of the Company's long-term obligations approximate their
               fair value. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
               Standards No. 107, "Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial
               Instruments," rates available at balance sheet dates to the
               Company are used to estimate the fair value of existing debt.

          E.   Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents represent
               cash and short-term highly liquid investments with original
               maturities of three months or less. The Company places its cash
               and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial
               institutions which may exceed federally insured amounts at times.

          F.   Inventory - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
               using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Market value for raw
               materials is defined as replacement cost and for work-in-progress
               and finished products as net realizable value. Inventory is
               comprised of the following at December 31, 2001 and 2000:


                                                       2001       2000

                                                     ========  ==========

          G.   Property, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment are
               carried at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated
               useful lives of the assets by the use of the straight-line and
               declining balance methods. These items consist of the following
               at December 31, 2001 and 2000:

                                                        Property, Plant and

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 Note 1.  Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies  (Continued)

          H.   Aggregate Inventory - Inventory, which consists of 70+ million
               short tons of previously quarried and stockpiled aggregate rock
               located at the site of the Groveland Mine in Dickinson County,
               Michigan, is stated at lower of cost or market. The Company is
               also subject to a royalty agreement which requires the payment of
               certain royalties to a previous owner of the aggregate inventory
               upon sale of the aggregate.

               In December, 2001 the aggregate inventory was sold to Iron
               Mountain Minerals, Inc., a 75% owned subsidiary of the company.
               The purchase price was $18,200,000 and is payable, with interest
               of 2.46%, in ninety six equal payments of principal and interest
               commencing December, 2003. The intercompany gain on this
               transaction has been eliminated in the consolidation process
               resulting in the aggregate inventory being carried at it's
               historical cost.

          I.   Goodwill - Goodwill resulted from the acquisition of Rustic
               Crafts in 1997 and Glas-Aire in 1999. The goodwill attributable
               to Rustic Crafts is being amortized straight-line over a period
               of 15 years. Accumulated amortization was $256,542 and $208,623
               at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

          J.   Debt Issuance Costs - Debt issuance costs are recorded at cost
               and are being amortized over 66 months, the life of the related
               loan using the effective interest method. Accumulated
               amortization was $587,361 and $398,329 at December 31, 2001 and
               2000, respectively.

          K.   Income Taxes - The Company utilizes Statement of Financial
               Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting for Income
               Taxes," which requires an asset and liability approach to
               financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. The
               difference between the financial statement and tax basis of
               assets and liabilities is determined annually. Deferred income
               tax assets and liabilities are computed for those temporary
               differences that have future tax consequences using the current
               enacted tax laws and rates that apply to the periods in which
               they are expected to affect taxable income. In some situations
               SFAS 109 permits the recognition of expected benefits of
               utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
               Valuation allowances are established based upon management's
               estimate, if necessary. Income tax expense is the current tax
               payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the net
               exchange in the deferred tax assets and liabilities.

          L.   Foreign Currency Translation - Glas-Aire's functional currency is
               the Canadian dollar and its operations have been translated into
               the U. S. dollar using Statement of Financial Accounting
               Standards No. 52.

          M.   Evaluation  of  Long  Lived  Assets

               Long-lived assets are assessed for recoverability on an ongoing
               basis. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of
               long-lived assets, their carrying value would be reduced by the
               excess, if any of the long-lived asset over management's estimate
               of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the
               related long-lived asset.

          N.   Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

               In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
               Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible
               assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are
               reviewed annually at a minimum for potential impairment by
               comparing the carrying value to the

               fair value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. The
               provisions of SFAS No. 142 apply to goodwill and intangible
               assets arising for acquisitions completed subsequent to June 30,
               2001. SFAS No. 142 is required to be adopted for goodwill and
               intangible assets arising from acquisitions prior to June 30,
               2001 as of December 31, 2001 and is effective for fiscal years
               beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company is currently
               determining the impact of adopting this standard under the
               transition provisions of SFAS No. 142.

               In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
               Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 addresses accounting and
               reporting for the obligations associated with the retirement of
               tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
               costs. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning
               after June 15, 2001. The Company is currently assessing the
               impact of this new standard.

          O.   Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
               conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
               management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
               reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
               contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
               statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
               during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
               those estimates.

          P.   Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications were made to prior
               period financial statement presentations to conform with current
               period presentations.

Note 2.   Investment in Glas-Aire

          On April 22, 1999, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
          Speed.com, Inc., acquired 513,915 shares of the common stock of
          Glas-Aire in exchange for the issuance of a promissory note of
          $650,000 due January 1, 2000, at an interest rate of 7.5% per annum,
          which note was guaranteed by Mr. Ponsoldt, Sr., President of the
          Company and $1,213,000 in cash. The cash was obtained from an
          affiliate of a shareholder through the issuance of an unsecured demand
          note at 7.5% per annum. The Company also purchased 3,000 shares of the
          common stock of Glas-Aire on the open market. On August 2, 1999, the
          Company acquired 41,600 shares of the common stock of Glas-Aire on the
          open market for $119,619. The funds were provided by an affiliate of a
          shareholder on an unsecured basis. On August 14, 1999, the Company
          sold 2,852,375 shares of its common stock to Glas-Aire for cash of
          $1,967,960 and 86,000 shares of Glas-Aire common stock for an
          aggregate consideration of $2,281,900. On September 23, 1999, the
          Company closed a common stock exchange agreement with certain
          shareholders of Glas-Aire. Under the agreement, the Company, in a
          private transaction, issued 1,188,000 shares of its restricted common
          stock to such shareholders in exchange for 288,000 newly issued shares
          of Glas-Aire stock. On May 17, 2000 the Company also issued 114,000
          shares of it's restricted common stock as additional consideration
          pursuant to the common stock exchange agreement.

          With the closing of the agreement, the Company owned 51.3% of the then
          outstanding common shares of Glas-Aire. Through December 31, 2000 the
          Company has increased the number of common shares of Glas-Aire to
          1,220,123 by virtue of the receipt of 287,608 common shares as the
          result of stock dividends. At December 31, 2000 such shares owned by
          the Company represented 50.1% of Glas-Aire's total issued and
          outstanding common shares.

          The Company accounted for the investment in Glas-Aire on the equity
          method from April 22, 1999 until September 23, 1999 when the Company's
          ownership exceeded 50%, whereupon the Company began to consolidate the
          accounts of Glas-Aire (Note 1A.). Income recognized under the equity
          method related to Glas-Aire in 1999 was $114,961 and is included in
          other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The common
          shares of the Company, held by Glas-Aire, are treated as treasury
          shares in these financial statements.

          The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations
          assumes that the consolidation of Glas-Aire occurred at January 1,
          1999. The pro forma results are for illustrative purposes only and do
          not purport to be indicative of the actual results which would have
          occurred had the transaction been consummated at an earlier date, nor
          are they indicative of results of operations which may occur in the
          future.

          Pursuant to an agreement entered into on September 17, 2001 and
          amended on October 1, 2001, the Company exchanged 1,215,105 shares of
          common stock of Glas-Aire, representing approximately 50% of the
          issued and outstanding shares of Glas-Aire, for $2,500,000 plus
          4,040,375 of its common stock, or approximately 23% of its issued and
          outstanding shares. As a result of the transaction, neither the
          company or Glas-Aire owns any stock of the other.

          The Company's consolidated results of operations for 2001 include the
          financial activity of Glas-Aire up to and through September 30, 2001.
          As a result of this transaction, Regency recognized a gain of
          $1,818,820 as follows:


          Cash received                                             $2,500,000

          On September 13, 2001 the Company was named as a defendant in
          litigation commenced by Glas-Aire's former president. The complaint
          alleges that the Regency/Glas-Aire transaction is in breach of bank
          agreements, securities law and fiduciary duties owed Glas-Aire and its
          stockholders. While the company has been served, plaintiff has, to
          date, taken no further action in this matter. Should the litigation
          proceed, the Company intends to vigorously defend its position.

Note 3.   Acquisition of Rustic Crafts

          In March 1997, the Company, through its newly formed subsidiary,
          Rustic Crafts, Inc. acquired all of the operating assets, including
          cash, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment and
          intangibles, of Rustic Crafts Co., Inc. Rustic Crafts, Inc. is
          involved in the manufacture of wood and cast marble decorative
          fireplaces, heater logs and related accessories. The Company paid
          $1,100,000 in cash and issued 100,000 shares of common stock and
          assumed trade accounts payable, bank debt and certain other accrued
          liabilities of $413,778. The transaction was accounted for using the
          purchase method and resulted in goodwill and intangibles of $715,000.
          Such goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a
          fifteen year period.

Note 4.   Investment in Partnerships

          In November 1994, the Company invested $350,000 for a limited
          partnership interest in Security Land and Development Company Limited
          Partnership ("Security"), which owns and operates an office complex.
          The Company has limited voting rights and is entitled to be allocated
          95% of the profit and loss of the Partnership until October 31, 2003
          (the lease termination date of the sole tenant of the office complex)
          and 50% thereafter. The Company is entitled to 95% of operating cash
          flow distributions, as defined, until October 31, 2003, which are
          expected to be limited in amount, and 50% thereafter.


                                                                              12

 Note 4.  Investment in Partnerships (Continued)

          For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company's
          income from its equity investment in the Partnership was $5,418,197,
          $4,712,615 and $4,261,214, respectively. These funds, however, are
          committed for the amortization of the outstanding principal balance on
          Security's real estate mortgage and, while the Company's equity
          investment has increased to $29,984,078 at December 31, 2001 the
          partnership does not provide liquidity to the Company in excess of an
          approximately $100,000 annual management fee.

          For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company
          earned $109,793, $106,251, and $101,326, respectively, for management
          services provided to Security.

          Security was organized to own and operate two buildings containing
          approximately 717,000 net rentable square feet consisting of a
          two-story office building and a connected six-story office tower. The
          building was purchased by Security in 1986 and is located on
          approximately 34.3 acres of land which is also owned by Security. The
          building has been occupied by the United States Social Security
          Administration's Office of Disability and International Operations for
          approximately 25 years under leases between the United States of
          America, acting by and through the General Services Administration
          ("GSA"). Effective November 1, 1994, Security and the GSA entered into
          a nine-year lease (the "Lease") for 100% of the building. The Lease,
          among other provisions, requires substantial renovations and
          improvements to the building, which were completed in 1998. Security
          has received an opinion of the Assistant General Counsel to the GSA
          that lease payments are not subject to annual appropriation by the
          United States Congress and the obligations to make such payments are
          unconditional general obligations of the United States Government.

          The Company accounts for the investment in partnership on the equity
          method, whereby the carrying value of the investment is increased or
          decreased by the Company's allocable share of Security's book income
          or loss. The investment in partnership included in the Consolidated
          Balance Sheets at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $29,984,078 and
          $24,565,881, respectively. The undistributed earnings from the
          Company's equity investment in the Partnership as of December 31, 2001
          and 2000 amounted to $29,635,078 and $24,215,881, respectively.


                                                                              13

Note 6. Note  Payable

          The Company's subsidiary, Rustic Crafts, has established a $1,000,000
          line of credit with PNC Bank. The line of credit expires on May 18,
          2002 and is renewable annually, and bears interest at the Bank's prime
          rate minus one-half percent (5.25% at December 31, 2001). The accounts
          receivable, inventory and other assets, such as property and
          equipment, of Rustic Crafts have been pledged as collateral to secure
          the line of credit. The line of credit is guaranteed by the Company.
          At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the amounts outstanding under the line
          of credit were $906,977 and $616,174, respectively.

          At December 31, 2000, the Company had outstanding $126,000 of demand
          notes bearing interest at 10%, payable to a shareholder. Additionally,
          the Company had outstanding a $650,000 demand note bearing interest at
          a rate of prime minus one percent to its President. These obligations
          were paid in 2001.

          On October 24, 2000, the Company obtained a commitment for a short
          term loan of $100,050 from a bank bearing interest at the prime rate
          plus three-fourths percent, adjusted monthly. As of December 31, 2000
          $76,000 remained outstanding; the interest rate was 10.25%. This
          obligation was guaranteed by two shareholders, one of whom was a
          former officer and director of the Company. (See Note 13)

Note 7.  Long-Term  Debt

          KBC Bank Loan - On June 24, 1998, the Company refinanced the long-term
          -------------
          debt previously outstanding with Southern Indiana Properties, Inc.
          ("SIPI") and entered into a Loan Agreement (the "Loan") with KBC Bank
          N.V. ("KBC"). Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, KBC advanced
          $9,383,320. The due date of the Loan is November 30, 2003 with
          interest at the rate of 7.5% compounded semi-annually on each June 1
          and December 1, commencing December 1, 1998. The interest may be paid
          by the Company in cash on these semi-annual dates or the Company may
          elect to add the interest to the principal of the Loan then
          outstanding. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the amount outstanding
          under the Loan is $12,089,931 and $11,311,808, respectively, including
          $2,706,611 and $1,928,488 of interest, through December 31, 2001 and
          2000, respectively.

          The Loan is secured by all of the Company's interest in Security,
          including the Company's interest in all profits and distributions,
          other than the payment of management fees of approximately $100,000
          annually, and all of the Company's rights, powers, and remedies under
          the Security Land and Development Company Limited Partnership
          Agreement as amended and restated. The security agreement requires the
          Company to maintain a certain ratio of debt to equity. At any time,
          the Company may prepay the entire principal balance of the Loan, plus
          accrued and unpaid interest, plus a make-whole premium as defined in
          the Loan Agreement, if any.


                                                                              15

Note 7.  Long-Term  Debt  (Continued)

          To facilitate the loan from KBC, the Company purchased a residual
          value insurance policy through R.V.I. American Insurance Company
          ("RVI") which secures the repayment of the outstanding principal and
          interest when due with a maximum liability of $14 million. Should RVI
          pay a claim under this policy they will be entitled to certain of the
          Company's rights with respect to the property of Security, including
          but not limited to the right to solicit bona fide, third party offers
          for the property and to accept such offers and bind the Partnership in
          order to recoup the amount paid. The costs related to the insurance
          ($745,000) along with legal fees and other costs associated with
          obtaining the Loan ($205,000) have been capitalized as debt issuance
          costs and are being amortized over the life of the Loan using the
          effective interest method.

          Mortgage  Loan - On March 25, 1998, Rustic Crafts purchased a building
          --------------
          of 126,000 square feet located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The purchase
          of this facility was funded in part by a first mortgage term loan in
          the amount of $960,000. The first mortgage term loan is payable in
          consecutive monthly installments over 10 years with a 20 year
          amortization. The balance outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000
          was $878,193 and $903,065, respectively.

          Equipment Loans - In connection with the purchase of the building, PNC
          ---------------
          Bank loaned the Company a total of $767,000 to finance the acquisition
          of new equipment and to install such equipment in the facility.
          Principal payments on one loan of $604,000 began in March 2000 and
          will continue for 120 months in amounts sufficient to amortize the
          outstanding balance over twenty years from March 2000. In March 2000
          the interest rate changed to the average weekly yield on U.S. Treasury
          Bills, plus 200 basis points. The remaining loan in the original
          amount of $163,500 is payable in equal monthly installments of $2,518.
          The outstanding balance of these loans was $ 675,766 and $730,797 at
          December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

          In June 1999, Rustic Crafts obtained an additional loan from PNC Bank
          for the purpose of funding additional equipment purchases and working
          capital in the amount of $156,000. The loan is payable in equal
          monthly installments, including principal and interest, of $3,153. The
          outstanding balance was $89,433 and $118,927 at December 31, 2001 and
          2000, respectively.

          The interest rates on the mortgage loan and the equipment loan vary
          from 7.52% to 8.50% as of December 31, 2001.

          Rustic Crafts' real and personal property, equipment, accounts
          receivable, inventory and other general intangibles are pledged as
          security for the loans. The loans are also guaranteed by Regency
          Affiliates, Inc., the parent company.

          Zero  Coupon  Bonds  - The zero coupon non-recourse secured bonds, due
          -------------------
          January 2, 2002, had a face value of $542,000 and a carrying value of
          $414,700 at December 31, 1998. The bonds were issued by NRDC and the
          difference (discount) between the face value and carrying value was
          being amortized utilizing the interest method at 9%. Interest expense
          related to the bonds for 1999 was $36,905.

          In 1999, certain bondholders agreed to exchange these zero coupon
          bonds for 121,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an agreed
          upon per share value of $1.00. Also, a significant amount of the bonds
          were retired in connection with the Agreement of the Company to
          discontinue certain claims against one of the bondholders. The
          exchange of common stock for the bonds and settlement of the claims
          resulted in a gain on retirement of debt of $330,605 (net of tax of
          $-0-, due to available net operating loss carryforward), which is
          reflected in the accompanying statement of operations as an
          extraordinary gain.

          Lease  Obligations  - Glas-Aire had two long-term lease obligations to
          ------------------
          purchase equipment. These obligations were five year capital leases
          and had been recorded as a capital asset and long-term debt. The
          Equipment, with a cost of $292,273 and $303,171 and accumulated
          depreciation of $46,764 and $18,980, as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
          respectively, was pledged as collateral for the leases. The terms of
          the leases required equal monthly installments of $7,484 including
          principal and interest over a five year period. Interest rates on the
          leases ranged from 6.5% to 8.6%. The total outstanding balance of

               of: 1) net proceeds of the assets of NRDC or 2) the redemption
               value (defined below). In the event of liquidation, the Series C
               shares are senior to all other shares of the Company's stock,
               with the exception of the Series E shares.

          (b)  The liquidation value of the Junior Series D shares includes
               accrued and unpaid dividends of $125,902 at December 31, 2001 and

          On January 31, 2000, the holders of the Series E preferred stock
          either converted their preferred shares to the Company's common stock
          or received cash equal to the par value of the shares, plus accrued
          dividends. The Company issued 95,877 of its common shares in exchange
          for 885 shares of preferred stock and paid cash in the amount of
          $159,300 for 1,593 shares.

          dividend right is equal to 20% (not to exceed $500,000) of annual
          after tax earnings of NRDC. At the Company's option, the Series C may
          be redeemed at the lesser of (a) the stated value plus accrued and
          unpaid dividends or (b) the fair market value of the common stock
          interest acquired by the Company in NRDC.

          Series  B  -  The  Series  B  shares  were issued in 1991 as part of a

Note 9.   Serial  Preferred  Stock  (Continued)

          (b)  At the Company's option, the shares may be redeemed, subject to
               certain limitations, by cash payment or by exchanging shares of
               its common stock at 77% of its stated value divided by the quoted
               market value of its common stock.

          (c)  A contingent conversion provision which conversion right, and the
               Company common shares to be issued in connection with the
               conversion, would be based on the stated value divided by the
               average bid and asked price for the 90 days preceding the
               conversion date of the Company's common shares. In addition, the
               number of the Company's common shares to be received upon
               conversion is subject to certain limitations.

          Junior  Series  D  -  The junior preferred stock was issued in 1992 in
          -----------------
          exchange for the Company's Restructuring Serial Promissory Notes. This
          preferred stock is redeemable, at the Company's option, at the stated
          value plus accrued and unpaid dividends and is contingently
          convertible into common at the fair market value of the common as
          determined by the average of the bid and asked price for the thirty
          (30) day period preceding the conversion date.

          Generally, no dividends can be paid on the Company's common stock
          until all cumulative dividends on the serial preferred stock have been
          paid. Additionally, no dividends on the Company's common shares can be
          paid if the Company is in default or in arrears with respect to any
          sinking or analogous fund or any call or tenders or other agreement
          for the purchase, redemption or other retirement of shares of
          preferred stock. No provision for dividends has been made for the
          Company's Series B and C "increasing rate preferred stock," as defined
          in Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5Q, due to the contingent nature of
          dividends on such shares.

          Generally the preferred shares have limited voting rights. However, in
          the event dividends payable on the Series C and E shares,
          respectively, are accumulated and unpaid for seven quarterly dividends
          (whether or not declared and whether or not consecutive), the holders
          of record of the Series C shares, shall thereafter have the right to
          elect two directors (each) until all arrears in required cash
          dividends (whether or not declared) on such shares have been paid. The
          Company's bylaws provide for eight members on its Board of Directors.
          At December 31, 2001 the company had no accumulated and unpaid
          dividends on Series C preferred shares.

Note 10.  Stock  Options/Stock  Option  Plans

          Effective June 3, 1997, the Company issued options to purchase 6.1
          million shares of common stock to Statesman Group, Inc. The options
          were issued to Statesman in order to secure the release of Mr. William
          R. Ponsoldt, Sr. to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of
          the Company and to recognize in part, the amendment to the Series C
          preferred shares under which Statesman forfeited certain common stock
          conversion rights with respect thereto. Statesman also agreed to
          provide loan guarantees not to exceed the sum of $300,000 upon the
          request of the company and a showing of reasonable need. Statesman
          and/or its affiliated interests have provided loan guarantees and/or
          unsecured prime interest rate direct loans to the Company exceeding
          $2,000,000 since June 1997. These options were exercised on October
          15, 2001 (See Note 5).

          In 2001 and 2000, the Company issued 70,000 and 90,000, respectively,
          non-qualified common stock options at the exercise price of $.40 (par
          value) and $.84 (fair market value) of the Company's common stock,
          respectively, on the date of grant, to the directors in accordance
          with the Director's Compensation Program approved by the shareholders.
          The 2001 and 2000 options will vest completely on February 5, 2002 and
          2001, and are exercisable until August 5, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


                                                                              19

Note 10.  Stock Options/Stock Option Plans (Continued)

          The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and
          related Interpretations in accounting for options. The Company has
          elected to treat these option awards to directors as employee based
          compensation and therefore has not recorded the estimated value of
          these options in the accompanying statement of operations. The fair
          value of the Company's stock-based compensation to directors was
          estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
          Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value
          of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
          transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input
          of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
          volatility. The Company's stock-based compensation has characteristics
          significantly different from those traded options and changes in the
          subjective input can materially affect the fair value estimate. The
          fair value of the Company's stock awards was estimated assuming the
          following assumptions: no expected dividends, risk free interest rate
          of 5.9% expected average life of approximately 2.5 to 5 years and
          expected stock price volatility of 90% in 2001, 41% in 2000 and 55% in
          1999. The weighted average fair value of options granted was $.22
          during 2001, $.38 during 2000, and $.43 during 1999.

          Had compensation cost for the options been determined based on the
          fair value at the grant dates for the awards, net income and net

Note 11.  Income Taxes

          As referred to in Note 1, the Company accounts for income taxes under
          SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The deferred taxes are the
          result of long-term temporary differences between financial reporting
          and tax reporting for depreciation, earnings from the Company's
          partnership investment in Security Land and Development Company
          Limited Partnership related to depreciation and amortization and the
          recognition of income tax carryforward items.

          At  December  31, 2001 and 2000, the Company's net deferred tax asset,
          utilizing  a  34%  effective  tax  rate,  consists  of:

</TABLE>

          The valuation allowance was established to reduce the net deferred tax
          asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. This
          reduction is necessary due to uncertainty of the Company's ability to
          utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards before
          they expire. The deferred tax liability relates to depreciation and is
          due to the consolidation of the accounts of Glas-Aire in 2000.
          Glas-Aire files a separate return for income tax purposes.

          For regular federal income tax purposes, the Company has remaining net
          operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7,507,000. These losses
          can be carried forward to offset future taxable income and, if not

          The  Company's  tax  returns  have  not  recently been examined by the
          Internal  Revenue  Service  ("Service") and there is no assurance that
          the  Service  would  not attempt to limit the Company's use of its net
          operating  loss  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.

          For  the  years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the tax effect
          of  net operating loss carryforwards reduced the current provision for
          regular  Federal  income  taxes by approximately $1,375,226, $670,000,
          and  $980,000,  respectively. At December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the
          Company  has  provided $368,211, $426,293, and $235,309, respectively,
          for  taxes,  which  relate  to  federal  taxes,  including alternative
          minimum  tax  liabilities  (See  Note  14)  and  state  income  taxes.

Note 12.  Employment Agreements

          On June 3, 1997, Regency entered into an Employment Agreement with
          William R. Ponsoldt, Sr., pursuant to which he became the President
          and CEO of the Company. The Agreement provides for Mr. Ponsoldt to
          continue in these duties until attainment of retirement age, provided
          that he may resign upon the provision of 30 days notice to the Company
          and further provided that Mr. Ponsoldt may be removed from office upon
          death or disability or for just cause. The Agreement provides for a
          base salary in annual installments, in advance, of $250,000 each,
          which salary is to be adjusted on January 1 of every year by any
          increase since the previous January 1 in the Consumer Price Index
          ("CPI") for All Urban Consumers, U.S. city average, as published by
          the U. S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics. As
          additional compensation, Mr. Ponsoldt is to receive an amount equal to
          20% of the Company's increase in quarterly common stock net worth,
          which is defined to be the difference between (i) total shareholders'
          equity and (ii) any shareholders' equity accounts relating to
          preferred stock. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, approximately $786,000
          and $935,000, respectively, of additional compensation is included in
          accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company may
          elect to pay up to 50% of the additional compensation by the issuance
          of warrants to purchase the Company's common stock at a price equal to
          50% of the average bid price for the Company's common stock for the

          and  other  relief.


Note 14.  Contingencies,  Risks  and  Uncertainties

          The  Company  is  subject  to  numerous  contingencies,  risks  and
          uncertainties  including, but not limited to, the following that could
          have  a  severe  impact  on  the  Company:

          (i)  The Company currently does not generate positive cash flow as the
               current  activities  of the Company do not, in and of themselves,
               generate  sufficient  cash  flow to cover its corporate operating
               expenses  and  thus the Company must rely on its cash reserves to
               fund  these  expenses.  The  Company's  ability  to  continue  in
               existence  is  partly  dependent  upon  its  ability  to  attain
               satisfactory  levels  of  operating  cash  flows.

         (ii)  The  Company  currently lacks the necessary infrastructure at the
               site of the Groveland Mine in order to permit the Company to make
               more  than  casual  sales  of  the  aggregate  (See  Note  1.G).

        (iii)  An  unsecured default in the Lease or sudden catastrophe to the
               Security  West  Building  from uninsured acts of God or war could
               have a materially adverse impact upon the Company's investment in
               Security  Land  and  Development Company Limited Partnership and,
               therefore,  its financial position and results of operations (See
               Note  4).

         (iv)  The  failure  of  the Social Security Administration to renew its
               lease  of  the  Security  West  Buildings  upon its expiration on
               October  31, 2003 could have a materially adverse impact upon the
               Company's  investment  in  Security  Land and Development Company
               Limited  Partnership.

          (v)  The Company has significant tax loss and credit carryforwards and
               no  assurance  can  be provided that the Internal Revenue Service
               would  not  attempt to limit or disallow altogether the Company's
               use,  retroactively  and/or prospectively, of such carryforwards,
               due to ownership changes or any other reason. The disallowance of
               the  utilization  of  the  Company's  net  operating  loss  would
               severely  impact  the Company's financial position and results of
               operations  due  to  the  significant  amounts  of taxable income
               (generated  by  the Company's investment in Security) that has in
               the past been, and is expected in the future to be, offset by the
               Company's  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  (See  Note  11).

         (vi)  As  described  at  Note  16, the Company's operating subsidiaries
               (Rustic Crafts) is dependent on a limited number of customers for
               a  substantial portion of its respective revenue. The loss of one
               or more of these customers could have a significant effect on the
               Company's  results  of  operations.

Note 15.  Lease Commitments

          Regency  leases  office  space  and  is committed to the minimum lease
          payment  of $34,048 through July 31, 2002 under an operating lease for
          premises.  Rent expense was $38,340, $43,276 and $42,990 for the years
          ended  December  31,  2001,  2000  and  1999,  respectively.


                                                                              23

Note 16.  Segment Information

          The  Company's  operating  structure  includes  operating segments for
          Automobile  Accessories  through September 30, 2001 (the operations of
