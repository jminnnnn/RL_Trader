ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL OVERVIEW

         Todhunter International, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading producer and
supplier of brandy, rum, wine and spirits to other beverage alcohol
manufacturers; produces, imports and markets premium branded spirits; bottles
beverage alcohol and other beverages on a contract basis and under its own
labels; and produces vinegar and cooking wine. The Company operates four
production facilities in the United States and one in St. Croix, United States
Virgin Islands and purchases certain products for resale. The Company is a
Delaware corporation organized in 1970 as a successor to a business founded in
the Bahamas in 1964. All references in this report to "Fiscal 2000", "Fiscal
1999" and "Fiscal 1998" shall refer to the Company's fiscal year ended September
30 of such year.

OWNERSHIP BY ANGOSTURA LIMITED

         Angostura Limited ("Angostura"), a Trinidad-based distiller, has
reported that, as a result of open market and private purchases beginning in
Fiscal 1999, it beneficially owned 2,814,113 shares, representing 51.0% of the
Company's common stock at November 30, 2000.

ACQUISITION OF MONARCH WINE COMPANY

         On November 17, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the
assets of Adams Wine Company d/b/a Monarch Wine Company of Georgia ("Monarch"),
Atlanta, Georgia (the acquisition of the assets of Monarch is hereafter referred
to as the "Monarch Acquisition"). The purchase price was $23.8 million in cash.
Monarch specializes in the manufacture of wines, including custom blended wines
and cooking wines for the food industry and base wines for producers of vinegar
and beverage alcohol.

         The Monarch Acquisition has strengthened the Company's position in the
beverage alcohol and food industry by expanding the Company's customer base and
product offerings, and has improved the Company's plant capacity utilization.
Synergies have also been realized and are expected to be realized in the future
in the areas of sales, distribution and administrative overhead. The Company
completed the integration of Monarch during the quarter ended March 31, 2000.

                                       1

SALE OF BAHAMIAN ASSETS

         In September 2000, the Company sold all of its remaining operating
assets in the Bahamas to British Fidelity Holdings Limited, an affiliate through
common ownership, for a $3.5 million note due in August 2005 and bearing
interest at 6% (see Note 4 to the Company's consolidated financial statements).
The Company recorded a loss of $78,838 on the transaction.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

         The Company operates primarily in the beverage alcohol industry in the
United States. The Company reports its operating results in five segments:

         - Bulk Alcohol Products (citrus brandy, citrus spirits, rum, cane
           spirits, fortified citrus wine, purchased distilled products and
           byproducts)
         - Premium Branded Spirits (primarily rum, flavored rum and tequila)
         - Bottling Operations (contract bottling services and proprietary and
           private label products)
         - Vinegar and Cooking Wine (bulk vinegar, bulk cooking wine, vinegar
           stock and proprietary and private label case goods)
         - Corporate Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items)

         Information regarding net sales, operating income (loss) and total
assets of each of the Company's business segments and information regarding
geographic areas is set forth in Note 12 to the Company's consolidated
financial statements.

         BULK ALCOHOL PRODUCTS. The Company produces and sells citrus brandy,
citrus spirits, rum, cane spirits and fortified citrus wine in the United
States. The Company also purchases other distilled products from several
suppliers for resale, including grain alcohol, which is denatured and packaged
and sold as industrial alcohol to hospitals, universities, fragrance producers
and other manufacturers. The Company is the largest supplier of citrus brandy,
bulk rum and fortified citrus wine in the United States. The Company sells its
bulk alcohol products to over 40 producers of beverage alcohol in the United
States and exports products to approximately 10 countries from the United
States. The Company's distilling operations produce a byproduct, which is sold
as animal feed.

         Citrus brandy and spirits are distilled from citrus juice byproducts
purchased from manufacturers of citrus juice concentrate. The Company's citrus
brandy is used primarily as an ingredient in flavored brandies. Citrus spirits
are used primarily as a fortifying ingredient to increase the alcohol content of
the Company's citrus wine and the wine of other manufacturers. The Company's
citrus wine is fermented from citrus juice and fortified with citrus spirits to
increase its alcohol content to approximately 20% by volume. Known as fortified
citrus wine, this product is used primarily as an ingredient in cordials,
whiskies and other beverage alcohol. Rum and cane spirits are distilled from
sugar cane molasses and are sold to other bottlers of rum, producers of beverage
alcohol, food companies and flavor manufacturers. Rum is also used in the
Company's premium branded spirits and bottling operations.

         Management believes that the Company's proximity to raw materials and
use of citrus byproducts in the production of bulk alcohol provide it with cost
advantages over competitors' products. Because end products are taxed on a
blended rate based upon the ingredients used rather than on the resulting
alcohol content of the end product, beverage alcohol producers can lower excise
taxes on their products by substituting fortified citrus wine for distilled
spirits alternatives. This cost savings arises because fortified citrus wine is
currently subject to federal excise taxes of $1.57 per gallon, whereas distilled
spirits are taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon (one proof gallon is approximately
equivalent in alcohol content to two and one-half gallons of fortified citrus
wine). The ability of beverage alcohol producers to substitute fortified citrus
wine for distilled spirits varies by end product according to government
regulations. For example, fortified citrus wine may contribute up to 49% of the
alcohol content of cordials and liqueurs, and up to approximately 10% of the
alcohol content of Canadian whiskey. In addition, small quantities of fortified
citrus wine may be used in blended whiskey, rum, brandy and other types of
beverage alcohol.

                                       2
<PAGE>

         PREMIUM BRANDED SPIRITS. The Company produces, bottles, imports,
develops and markets a line of premium branded spirits in the United States and
exports distilled spirits to about 5 countries in Europe. Since 1996, the
Company has established and strengthened relationships with wholesalers,
expanded its distribution network, developed new products, obtained agency
agreements and acquired management and marketing expertise. Management's
strategy has been to focus on marketing and building premium brands with an
initial emphasis on the rum and tequila categories. The Company's principal
premium brands include:

         - Cruzan Estate Rums
         - Cruzan Flavored Rums
         - Porfidio Tequila

         BOTTLING OPERATIONS. The Company's bottling operations include
contract bottling services and the production, bottling and marketing of a
complete line of distilled spirits under its own proprietary labels and under
the private labels of major retailers. The Company's primary bottling
operations are located in Florida and serve customers in the Southeastern
United States. The Company also produces and sells proprietary label products
in the United States Virgin Islands.

         Contract bottling products include distilled spirits, coolers, prepared
cocktails, fruit juices, carbonated and non-carbonated fruit flavored beverages
and flavored sparkling water. The Company's proprietary and private label
products include rum, gin, vodka, tequila, cordials and various whiskies. The
Company's proprietary label products are marketed in the popular-price category
of the distilled spirits market.

         VINEGAR AND COOKING WINE. To complement its distilling, winery and
bottling operations, the Company produces vinegar, vinegar stock, and cooking
wine for sale to condiment manufacturers, food service distributors and major
retailers. The Company's sales to retailers are sold under its proprietary
labels and under the private labels of major retailers in the United States and
Canada.

         CORPORATE OPERATIONS AND OTHER. Corporate Operations and Other includes
traditional corporate items and the results of certain nonmaterial operations.

DEPENDENCE ON MAJOR CUSTOMERS

         The Company sells its bulk alcohol products to over 40 producers of
beverage alcohol in the United States and foreign countries. The Company's
contract bottling services and proprietary and private label products are sold
to a limited number of customers. The Company's vinegar and cooking wine are
sold to over 700 condiment manufacturers, food service distributors and
retailers. The Company has major customers in its bulk alcohol products and
bottling operations businesses. The loss of one or more of the Company's major
customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and
results of operations.

PRODUCTION

         The Company's principal domestic production facilities are located in
Lake Alfred and Auburndale, Florida, both near Orlando and central to Florida's
citrus growing region. The two plants have similar distilling, bottling and
winery operations, allowing the Company to shift production from one plant to
the other. The Lake Alfred plant also has a vinegar production facility. Both
plants are near major highways and are serviced by a railroad, providing good
transportation access. The Company has a cold storage, warehousing and P.E.T.
bottle manufacturing facility in Winter Haven, Florida. The Company also
operates a winery and vinegar production facility in Louisville, Kentucky. The
Company's offshore rum production facilities are located in St. Croix, United
States Virgin Islands.

         DISTILLING. The Company begins its distilling process with citrus or
cane molasses, which is fermented for approximately two to seven days. Once
fermented, the product has an average alcohol content of 4% by volume, which
is increased to approximately 95% through distillation. The alcohol is then
processed through rectifying columns and further refined. The finished
product is stored in stainless steel tanks, except rum, which is generally
stored in wooden barrels for aging purposes. The Lake Alfred, Auburndale and
Virgin Islands facilities can produce, on a combined basis, up to 23 million
gallons of distilled products per year.

                                       3
<PAGE>


         WINERY. Wine is produced by the fermentation of citrus or grape
juice. After fermentation, the wine is fortified by the addition of distilled
citrus spirits to raise its alcohol content to approximately 20% by volume.
Fortified citrus wine is sold to producers of beverage alcohol. The wineries
are physically segregated from the distilling operations and have their own
set of fermenting and storage tanks. The Lake Alfred, Auburndale and
Louisville facilities can produce, on a combined basis, up to 30 million
gallons of wine per year.

         BOTTLING. The Lake Alfred and Auburndale plants both have automated,
high-speed bottling lines capable of filling up to 600 12-ounce containers per
minute. Lake Alfred has two lines that are used primarily to bottle vinegar and
juices, two lines that are used to bottle the proprietary and private label
products and one line to bottle premium branded spirits. Auburndale has two
lines that are dedicated to bottling coolers and prepared cocktails and three
lines that bottle proprietary and private label products, premium branded
spirits and cooking wine. The Company's warehouse storage areas can accommodate
up to 800,000 cases. The Company's plant in the Virgin Islands has one line
capable of bottling up to 250,000 cases per year. The Company distills and ages
its own rum, but generally produces its other proprietary and private label
products from alcohol purchased from third parties. Depending on the particular
formula for a product, the Company adds flavoring and/or sugar, reduces the
product's proof and then filters and bottles the finished product. The Company's
bottling capacity is approximately 10 million cases per year.

         VINEGAR AND COOKING WINE. Vinegar is produced by converting alcohol
into acetic acid. Several varieties of vinegar, including white distilled, red
wine, white wine, corn, rice wine, balsamic, tarragon and apple cider, are
produced at the Lake Alfred and Louisville facilities which have a combined
capacity of 9 million grain gallons per year. Cooking wine is produced by the
controlled fermentation of red or white grape juice into wine. Several varieties
of cooking wine, including red, white, sherry, golden, marsala and chablis, are
produced at the Lake Alfred, Auburndale and Louisville facilities.

         QUALITY CONTROL. Each of the Company's facilities is equipped with a
quality control laboratory. The Company employs several chemists who continually
test to ensure the quality of its raw materials and end products.

         RAW MATERIALS. The principal raw materials used in the Company's
distilling operations are citrus molasses, a byproduct of citrus juice
production, and cane molasses, a byproduct of sugar production. Citrus molasses,
which is used in the production of citrus brandy and citrus spirits, accounted
for approximately 60% of the raw materials used in the Company's distilling
operations in Fiscal 2000. Cane molasses, which is used in the production of rum
and cane spirits, accounted for the remaining 40%. Citrus juice concentrate is
the primary raw material used in the Company's winery operations. The Company
purchases such raw materials from a variety of suppliers. The Company purchases
distilled products, used in its bulk alcohol products and bottling operations
businesses, from several suppliers. Glass bottles and other materials, such as
caps, labels and cardboard cartons, are used in bottling and packaging and are
available from numerous suppliers. Alcohol and grape juice concentrate are the
primary raw materials used in the Company's vinegar and cooking wine operations.
During Fiscal 2000, one supplier accounted for more than 10% of the Company's
raw material purchases. The cost of raw materials fluctuates depending upon a
number of factors, including crop conditions, weather, governmental programs and
purchases by foreign governments.

FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS; SEASONALITY

         The Company has a limited number of customers, and these customers
often purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place
significant orders for contract bottling services, distilled spirits, vinegar
and cooking wine. Accordingly, the size and timing of purchase orders and
product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from
quarter to quarter. Additionally, some Company products generate higher profit
margins than others, and changes in the Company's product mix will cause gross
margins to fluctuate. Certain aspects of the Company's business are also
seasonal, with increased demand for the Company's contract bottling services
from April to October and increased production of the Company's bulk alcohol
products during the months from November to June, corresponding to the Florida
citrus harvest. As a result of these factors, the Company's operating results
may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

                                       4

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

         Bulk alcohol products are sold primarily in large quantities through
the Company's salespeople. The Company's marketing strategy emphasizes the cost
advantages of these products over other ingredients available to end producers.
Bulk alcohol products are sold primarily to other bottlers, distillers and end
producers located throughout the United States and Canada.

         The Company sells proprietary and private label spirits to wholesalers
for distribution primarily in the Southeastern United States. The Company's
marketing strategy for these products places primary emphasis upon promotional
programs emphasizing the Company's cost advantages, directed at wholesalers and
retailers, rather than consumers. Wholesalers and retailers market these
products to retailers and directly to consumers, respectively. Although
competition for retail shelf space in the beverage alcohol industry is
significant, wholesalers of such products, and not the Company, generally must
address such competition, although the Company's promotional programs may have a
beneficial effect upon the allocation of retail shelf space for its products.
The Company produces, imports, markets and sells premium branded spirits to
wholesalers in the United States. The Company's marketing and promotional
programs for its premium brands are directed at wholesalers, retailers and
consumers. Sales of the Company's proprietary and private label and premium
branded spirits are generally made FOB (free on board) at the Company's
facilities and, accordingly, the purchasers of such products are responsible for
the risk of loss and transportation costs. In addition to its salesforce, the
Company works through various brokers to develop and service its sales to
wholesalers and retailers.

         The Company's marketing strategy with respect to its contract bottling
services emphasizes the cost advantages and quality of the Company's services.
Arrangements with bottling customers are typically negotiated by the Company's
executive officers.

         Vinegar and cooking wine are sold primarily in large quantities to
manufacturers, distributors and retailers through the Company's salesforce.
These products are also sold through wholesalers and directly to retailers under
the Company's proprietary labels and under the private labels of retailers.

COMPETITION

         The areas of the beverage alcohol industry in which the Company does
business are highly competitive with respect to price, service and product
quality, and there are several companies with substantially greater financial
and other resources than the Company. The Company's citrus-based bulk alcohol
products compete primarily with producers of grape-based products. While the
Company is aware of only two other domestic producers of citrus brandy and
spirits, there exist several producers of grape-based distilled products. The
Company's proprietary and private label products and premium branded spirits
compete on a regional and national basis against other distilled spirits
products, including premium labels, mid-price and popular-price products. The
proprietary label and premium branded spirits produced by the Company compete
with those of companies for whom the Company performs contract bottling services
and to whom the Company sells its bulk alcohol products. The Company believes
that its relationships with such customers are good and has not experienced any
adverse effects, such as termination or non-renewal of ongoing contracts, as a
result of such competition. Based upon its historical experience and customer
relationships, the Company does not expect to experience any adverse effects
from such competition in the foreseeable future. Contract bottling operations
compete against other bottlers located throughout the Southeastern United
States. The Company experiences similar competition in its vinegar and cooking
wine operations. While Management believes that it has achieved a strong
competitive position in the markets it serves, there can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to maintain its competitive position in the future.

REGULATION AND TAXATION

         The production, importing and sale of wine and spirits is subject to
extensive regulation by certain federal and state agencies, and the Company
is required to obtain various permits, bonds and licenses to comply with
regulations. Pursuant to federal and state environmental requirements, the
Company is required to obtain permits and licenses to operate certain
facilities, and to treat and remove effluents discharged from its distilling,
winery and bottling operations. Management believes it is presently in
material compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations.

                                       5
<PAGE>

         Beverage alcohol produced and bottled by the Company is subject to
substantial federal excise taxes. Excise taxes are currently imposed at flat
rates of $13.50 per proof gallon for distilled spirits and $1.57 per gallon
for fortified wine.

         The Company's fortified wine products, as an ingredient of beverage
alcohol, have a cost advantage under the component method of taxation, which
taxes wine at a lower rate than distilled spirits. Changes in, or the
elimination of, the component method of taxation, as it relates to wine, would
have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.

EMPLOYEES

         As of September 30, 2000, the Company had approximately 375 full-time
employees. Additional workers are generally employed at the Company's bottling
facilities during the summer months when the bulk of contract bottling takes
place. None of the Company's employees are members of any labor union nor are
there any collective bargaining agreements between the Company and its
employees, with the exception of the Company's Virgin Islands employees. The
Virgin Islands operation, consisting of approximately 60 employees, is fully
unionized. Management believes that its relations with its employees are good.

INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

         The Company has facilities in Florida and Kentucky for the production
of its bulk alcohol products, premium branded spirits, contract bottling
services, vinegar and cooking wine. The Company sells its products and services
primarily to customers in the United States but also exports certain products to
foreign countries, primarily in Europe, Canada and the Caribbean. The Company's
rum production facilities are located in St. Croix, United States Virgin
Islands. Rum produced in the Virgin Islands is sold primarily to other bottlers
of rum, producers of beverage alcohol, food companies and flavor manufacturers
located in the United States but is also sold to foreign countries in the
Caribbean, South America and Europe. See Note 12 to the Company's consolidated
financial statements for additional information about the Company's foreign and
domestic operations and export sales.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

         The Company owns all of its principal production facilities, including
all related land, buildings, and equipment. The Lake Alfred facility consists of
four principal buildings with approximately 250,000 square feet on 32 acres. The
Auburndale facility consists of three principal buildings with approximately
250,000 square feet on 16 acres. The Louisville facility consists of three
principal buildings with approximately 60,000 square feet on 27.5 acres. The
Winter Haven facility consists of three principal buildings with approximately
140,000 square feet on 30 acres. The Virgin Islands facility consists of seven
principal buildings with approximately 200,000 square feet on 30 acres. The
Company leases approximately 10,000 square feet of office space in West Palm
Beach, Florida for its executive offices. Management believes that all of its
facilities, both owned and leased, are adequate and suitable for operations in
the foreseeable future.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to litigation from time to
time in the ordinary course of business. Legal proceedings pending as of

addition, based upon a list of non-objecting beneficial owners, there were at
least 529 beneficial owners at January 20, 2000.

         No dividend was paid to stockholders during the fiscal years ended
September 30, 1999 and 2000. The Company intends to continue to retain earnings
for use in the business of the Company and therefore does not anticipate
declaring or paying cash dividends in the immediate future. The payment of cash
dividends requires the consent of the Company's lender.

</TABLE>

         The Company is a leading producer and supplier of brandy, rum, wine and
spirits to other beverage alcohol manufacturers; produces, imports and markets
premium branded spirits; bottles beverage alcohol and other beverages on a
contract basis and under its own labels; and produces vinegar and cooking wine.

         The Company's net sales and gross margins (gross profit as a percentage
of net sales) vary depending on the mix of business among the Company's
products. Historically, gross margins have been highest in bulk alcohol products
and premium branded spirits and lower in bottling operations and vinegar and
cooking wine operations. Within its bottling operations, sales and gross margins
have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the Company's
"Type A" and "Type B" bottling customers. Type A bottling customers pay the
Company to purchase their raw materials and these costs are passed through to
the customer. Type B bottling customers supply their own raw materials and are
only charged for bottling charges. Although gross profit per case for the
Company's Type A and Type B bottling customers is approximately equal, given the
same case volume, net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products
bottled for Type A bottling customers are higher, and gross margins are lower,
than for Type B bottling customers. As a result, significant fluctuations in
volume of Type A bottling customers can distort the Company's gross margin.

         The Company has a limited number of customers, and these customers
often purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place
significant orders for contract bottling services, distilled spirits, vinegar
and cooking wine. Accordingly, the size and timing of purchase orders and
product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from
quarter to quarter. Additionally, some Company products generate higher profit
margins than others, and changes in the Company's product mix will cause gross
margins to fluctuate. Certain aspects of the Company's business are also
seasonal, with increased demand for the Company's contract bottling services
from April to October and increased production of the Company's bulk alcohol
products during the months from November to June, corresponding to the Florida
citrus-harvest. As a result of these factors, the Company's operating results
may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

         Net sales represent the Company's gross sales less excise taxes. Excise
taxes are generally payable on products bottled by the Company. In addition,
excise taxes are payable on sales of industrial alcohol to certain customers.
Accordingly, excise taxes vary from period to period depending upon the
Company's product and customer mix.

ACQUISITION OF MONARCH WINE COMPANY

         On November 17, 1999, the Company completed the Monarch Acquisition.
The purchase price was $23.8 million in cash. Monarch specializes in the
manufacture of wines, including custom blended wines and cooking wines for the
food industry and base wines for producers of vinegar and beverage alcohol.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999

         NET SALES. Net sales were $93.0 million in 2000, an increase of $21.2%
from net sales of $76.7 million in 1999.

         Net sales of bulk alcohol products were $37.5 million in 2000, an
increase of 11.7% from net sales of $33.5 million in 1999. The increase resulted
from increased sales of bulk alcohol resulting from the Monarch Acquisition.
Unit sales of citrus spirits decreased 53.9% and unit sales of fortified citrus
wine increased 59.1% in 2000 compared to 1999. These changes resulted from the
Monarch Acquisition. Monarch was a major purchaser of the Company's citrus
spirits for use in producing fortified citrus wine.

         Net sales of premium branded spirits were $16.1 million in 2000, an
increase of 32.9% from net sales of $12.1 million in 1999. Sales increases
reflect the continued expansion of the Company's distribution network and the
success of its Cruzan Flavored Rums and Porfidio Tequila brands.

         Net sales of the Company's bottling operations were $16.8 million in
2000, a decrease of 5.4% from net sales of $17.8 million in 1999. The unit
volume of the Company's bottling operations decreased 1.8% in 2000. The decrease
in volume was primarily attributable to a decrease in business with the
Company's largest Type A bottling customer. The Company believes that the
business with this Type A bottling customer will not return to historic levels.

         Net sales of vinegar and cooking wine were $20.5 million in 2000, an
increase of 85.7% from net sales of $11.0 million in 1999. The increase in net
sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of cooking wine resulting
from the Monarch Acquisition. The Company has recently expanded its vinegar
production capacity by building additional facilities.

         GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit was $28.9 million in 2000, an increase of
21.6% from gross profit of $23.7 million in 1999. Gross margin increased to
31.0% in 2000 from 30.9% in 1999.

         SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and
administrative expenses were $17.9 million in 2000, an increase of 19.0% from
$15.0 million in 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to (1) increased
marketing expenses and new employees related to the Company's premium branded
spirits business; (2) expenses incurred during the integration of the Monarch
Acquisition, and (3) increased amortization expense.

         OPERATING INCOME. The following table sets forth the operating income

         As a result of the above factors, operating income was $11.0 million in
2000, an increase of 26.1% over operating income of $8.7 million in 1999.

         INTEREST INCOME. The Company earns interest on its cash, short-term
investments and notes receivable. The increase in interest income in 2000 was
attributable to higher average amounts of cash, short-term investments and notes
receivable outstanding compared to 1999.

         INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense was $5.0 million in 2000 and $3.6
million in 1999. The increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of
debt outstanding due to the Monarch Acquisition and higher interest rates during
2000 compared to 1999.

         INCOME TAX EXPENSE. The Company's effective income tax rate was 24.6%
in 2000 and 24.3% in 1999. The low tax rate is attributable to the Virgin
Islands subsidiary, which has a 90% exemption from United States federal income
taxes (see Note 9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements).


FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1998

         NET SALES. Net sales were $76.7 million in 1999, an increase of 2.2%
from net sales of $75.1 million in 1998.

         Net sales of bulk alcohol products were $33.5 million in 1999, an
increase of 3.1% from net sales of $32.5 million in 1998. The increase resulted
primarily from (i) an increase in sales of citrus spirits and rum, and (ii) an
improved product mix of sales of purchased distilled products. These increases
were partially offset by decreases in citrus brandy, cane spirits and
byproducts.

         Net sales of premium branded spirits were $12.1 million in 1999, an
increase of 15.6% from net sales of $10.5 million in 1998. Sales increases
reflect the continued expansion of the Company's distribution network into new
markets and the success of its Cruzan Flavored Rums and Porfidio Tequila.

         Net sales in the Company's bottling operations were $17.8 million in
1999, a decrease of 7.3% from net sales of $19.2 million in 1998. The Company's
overall bottling volume decreased 4.6% in 1999. The decrease in volume was
primarily attributable to a decrease in business with the Company's largest Type
A bottling customer. The Company believes that the business with this Type A
bottling customer will not return to historic levels. Sales of the Company's
proprietary and private label products decreased 1.5% in 1999.

         Net sales of vinegar and cooking wine were $11.0 million in 1999, an
increase of 4.6% from net sales of $10.5 million in 1998. The Company's two
vinegar plants were operating at maximum capacity in 1999.

         GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit was $23.7 million in 1999, an increase of
7.4% from gross profit of $22.1 million in 1998. Gross margin increased to 30.9%
in 1999 from 29.4% in 1998. The improvement in gross margin was primarily
attributable to a favorable change in product mix in the Company's bulk alcohol
products and a decrease in contract bottling volume with a Type A bottling
customer.

         SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and
administrative expenses were $15.0 million in 1999, an increase of 7.8% from
$13.9 million in 1998. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.5%
of net sales in 1999 and 18.6% in 1998. The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses in 1999, was primarily attributable to increased
marketing and new employees related to the Company's efforts to increase its
distribution network. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in
administrative overhead.

</TABLE>

         As a result of the above factors, operating income was $8.7 million
in 1999, an increase of 6.8% from operating income of $8.2 million in 1998.

         INTEREST INCOME. The Company earns interest income on its cash,
short-term investments and notes receivable. The increase in interest income
in 1999 was attributable to higher average amounts of cash, short-term
investments and notes receivable outstanding compared to 1998.

         INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense was $3.6 million in 1999 and $3.9
million in 1998. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower levels of
debt outstanding and lower rates during 1999 compared to 1998.

         OTHER, NET. Included in other income is a nonrecurring gain of $.1
million in 1999 and $.4 million in 1998.

         INCOME TAX EXPENSE. The Company's effective income tax rate was
24.3% in 1999 and 14.6% in 1998. The low tax rate is attributable to the
Virgin Islands subsidiary which has a 90% exemption from United States
federal income taxes. Also, in 1998 the Company amended its 1993, 1994 and
1995 income tax returns, which resulted in loss carryforwards available in
1998 and a refund of income taxes previously paid. No such loss carryforwards
or refunds were available in 1999.

FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         GENERAL

         The Company's principal use of cash in its operating activities is
for purchasing raw materials to be used in its manufacturing operations,
purchasing imported products for its premium branded spirits business and
carrying inventories and the subsequent receivables. The Company's source of
liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations and its line of
credit. Some of the Company's manufacturing operations are seasonal and the
Company's borrowings on its line of credit vary during the year. For example,
the Company uses citrus molasses as its primary raw material in the
production of citrus brandy and spirits at its two Florida distilleries. The
Company buys citrus molasses, a byproduct of citrus juice production, from
local manufacturers of citrus juice and concentrate during the citrus
harvest, which generally runs from November to June. The Company generally
begins purchasing citrus molasses in November and builds inventory of citrus
brandy and spirits. The Company must manufacture and build inventory while
raw materials are available due to the short life of the citrus molasses it
purchases. Another seasonal business of the Company is its contract bottling
services. Demand for contract bottling services is highest during the months
from April through October. Management believes that cash provided by its
operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy
its working capital, liquidity and anticipated capital expenditure
requirements for both its short-term and long-term capital needs.


                                       13

<PAGE>


         OPERATING ACTIVITIES

         Net cash provided by operating activities in 2000 was $4.4 million,
which resulted from $9.5 million in net income adjusted for noncash items,
less $5.1 million representing the net change in operating assets and
liabilities.

         INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES

         Net cash used in investing activities in 2000 was $30.9 million,
which resulted primarily from $5.8 million of capital expenditures, $23.8
million used for the Monarch Acquisition and a net increase of $2.3 million
in short-term investments. Payments received on notes receivable of $1.8
million were offset by new notes issued of $.3 million. During the third
quarter of 2000, the Company converted a $1,000,000 loan to Premier Wines &
Spirits, Ltd. ("Premier"), a 45% owned subsidiary, into a capital
contribution in order to improve Premier's capital structure.

         The Company's capital expenditures were $5.8 million in 2000 and
$2.6 million in 1999. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily
attributable to (1) improving the Company's wine production capacity, (2)
expanding vinegar production capacity and (3) improving the Company's rum
production capacity.

         Net cash provided by financing activities in 2000 was $24.5 million,
which resulted from (1) proceeds from term loans and other notes of $56.9
million and (2) an increase of $8.5 million in borrowings under the revolving
credit facility, offset by (3) payments of long-term debt totaling $40.1
million.

         In November 1999, the Company's previous long-term debt and line of
credit were replaced with a $71 million credit agreement between the Company
and a syndicate of lenders. The new credit agreement consists of a $15
million revolving credit facility which expires in November 2002 and a term
loan with an initial amount of $56 million which matures on December 31,
2004. In November 1999, the Company used $23.5 million of the term loan to
fund the Monarch Acquisition. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility
were $8.5 million at September 30, 2000. See Note 8 to the Company's
consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the
Company's long-term debt.

         The Company's total debt was $59.3 million as of September 30, 2000,
and its ratio of debt to equity was 1.1 to 1.

         The Company's share of the undistributed earnings of the Bahamian
and Virgin Islands subsidiaries was approximately $8.1 million and $21.1
million, respectively, as of September 30, 2000. No provision has been made
for taxes which would result from the remittance of such undistributed
earnings as the Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely. See
Note 9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional
information on income taxes related to these subsidiaries.

         Based on current plans and business conditions, management expects
that its cash and cash equivalents, together with any amounts generated from
operations and available borrowings, will be sufficient to meet the Company's
cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. It
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those
instruments at fair value. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 during the second
quarter of Fiscal 2000.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

         The Company uses natural gas in its distilling operations and has
recently experienced significant increases in its energy costs as a result of
natural gas price increases. At the present time, management believes that
the Company's energy costs relating to natural gas will continue to increase.
Where competitively feasible, management plans to increase selling prices to
offset the effects of natural gas price increases, but the Company may not be
able to recover these energy cost increases.

         Except as noted above, the Company's results of operations and
financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and
changing prices. The Company has been able, subject to normal competitive
conditions, to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Todhunter International, Inc. and Subsidiaries
West Palm Beach, Florida

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Todhunter
International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000 and 1999, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2000.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Todhunter
International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000 and 1999, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended September 30, 2000 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF BUSINESS: Todhunter International, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading
producer and supplier of brandy, rum, wine and spirits to other beverage alcohol
manufacturers; produces, imports and markets premium branded spirits; bottles
beverage alcohol and other beverages on a contract basis and under its own
labels; and produces vinegar and cooking wine. The Company operates four
production facilities in the United States and one in St. Croix, United States
Virgin Islands and purchases products for resale from other producers.

OWNERSHIP: Angostura Limited ("Angostura"), a Trinidad-based distiller, has
reported that, as a result of open market and private purchases beginning in
fiscal 1999, it beneficially owned 2,814,113 shares, representing 51.0% of the
Company's common stock at November 30, 2000.

A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies follows:

  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the
  accounts of Todhunter International, Inc. and all of its majority-owned
  subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
  eliminated in consolidation. Investments in business entities in which the
  Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant
  influence over operating and financial policies (generally 20-50% ownership),
  are accounted for by the equity method.

  ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
  with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
  liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
  the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
  during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue when its product is
  shipped, at which time title passes to the customer. Revenues from contract
  bottling services are recognized at the time the bottling process is
  completed. Excise taxes on products sold are billed directly to customers and
  are included in sales at the same time the product sold is recognized as
  revenue.

  CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers certificates of deposit and other
  short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be
  cash equivalents. The Company maintains depository accounts in excess of FDIC
  insured limits. The Company has not experienced any credit losses in such
  accounts and does not anticipate any losses.

  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS: The Company has investments in certificates of
  deposits, corporate bonds, and U. S. Government securities which mature within
  one year of purchase. All of the Company's short-term investments are
  classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost.

  INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
  determined using the first-in, first-out method.

  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The Company has a derivative financial instrument to
  reduce the Company's interest rate risk. The derivative instrument consists of
  an interest rate cap agreement with a bank, which is being accounted for as a
  cash flow hedge under Financial Accounting Standard No. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR
  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. The Company's policy is not to
  hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

  Effective for fiscal year 2000, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
  Standard No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
  ACTIVITIES, as amended, which requires companies to report all derivative
  instruments on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for
  designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships. If a derivative is not
  a hedge, it must be adjusted to fair value through income. If a derivative is
  a hedge, and depending on the nature of the hedge, any change in the fair
  value of the derivative is either (1) offset against the change in fair value
  of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitments through earnings, or (2)
  recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized
  in earnings or the term of the hedge expires. The ineffective portion of a
  derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.

  AMORTIZATION: Amortization is computed on the straight-line basis over the
  estimated lives of the capitalized assets. Estimated lives are as follows:

  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: In accordance with FASB Statement No. 121,
  ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS
  TO BE DISPOSED OF, the Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets
  used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets
  might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by
  those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets.

(i)  In November 1999, the Company entered into a $71 million credit agreement,
     which consists of $56 million term loans and a $15 million revolving loan
     facility. The credit agreement is collateralized by 65% of the issued and
     outstanding stock of the Company's majority-owned subsidiaries. The
     proceeds of these notes were used to prepay all borrowings under the
     previous finance agreements and to finance a business acquisition (see Note
     18). The Company is required to maintain minimum fixed charge and interest
     coverage ratios in addition to other financial covenants.

In fiscal year 2000, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $1,168,790,
net of an income tax benefit of $382,075 on its early extinguishment of debt.

On January 14, 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement.
The agreement caps the applicable Eurodollar rate under the credit agreement at
7.5%. At September 30, 2000 the underlying applicable Eurodollar rate was 6.62%.
The Company paid $250,000 for this cap which has a term of two years. The
notional amount of this agreement at September 30, 2000 was $50,000,000. For the
year ended September 30, 2000, the Company has recorded an unrealized loss of
$240,500 related to this agreement which has been reflected as other
comprehensive loss.

The Company has used interest rate swap agreements to change the fixed/variable
interest rate mix of its debt portfolio and to reduce the Company's aggregate
risk to movements in interest rates. A summary of the interest rate swap
agreements is as follows:

(1)  The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank
     calling for the Company to exchange, as of May 1 and November 1 through
     2004, interest payment streams calculated on a principal balance starting
     at $4,000,000 and reducing starting in November 1999. The Company's
     interest under this agreement was calculated based upon a floating rate of
     1.06% above the six-month LIBOR rate. The bank's rate was 8.905%. During
     1999 and 1998, the Company received net payments of $95,245 and $87,054,
     respectively, related to this agreement, and reduced interest expense
     accordingly. This agreement was terminated in November 1999 in conjunction
     with the refinancing of the Company's debt.

(2)  The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank,
     accounted for as a hedge. This agreement was terminated in fiscal year
     1999. During 1999 and 1998, the Company made net payments of $16,459 and
     $29,208, respectively, related to this agreement, and increased interest
     expense accordingly.

Generally, the operating income of the Company's Bahamian subsidiary is not
subject to United States income taxes as there are no income taxes in the
Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The Company sold all of its remaining operating
assets in the Bahamas in fiscal year 2000 for $3.5 million. Certain passive
income of the Bahamian subsidiary is subject to United States income taxes.

The Virgin Islands subsidiary, through the Industrial Development Commission of
the Government of the Virgin Islands of the United States, has received a 90%
exemption from income taxes on operating income. This exemption is effective
through January 31, 2002. The per share effect of this exemption on earnings on
a basic and diluted basis for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, is as follows:

</TABLE>

With respect to the Bahamian and Virgin Islands subsidiaries, no provision has
been made for taxes which would result from the remittance of such undistributed
earnings as the Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely. The
Company's share of the undistributed earnings of the Bahamian and Virgin Islands
subsidiaries was approximately $8,100,000 and $21,100,000, respectively, as of
September 30, 2000. The undistributed earnings of the Bahamian subsidiary have
been reduced by any previously taxed income.

Rent expense for office space (including the Company's share of common area
expenses, real estate and sales taxes) amounted to $309,832, $303,770 and
$359,484 for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

NOTE 11. STOCK OPTIONS

On August 11, 1992, the Company adopted a stock option plan for the grant of
options to key employees. Option prices may not be less than 85% of the fair
market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant for nonqualified
options or 100% of such fair market value for qualified stock options. As of
September 30, 2000, 1,400,000 shares are reserved for issuance under the option
plan. Options granted have vesting periods ranging from 3 to 5 years. During the
year ended September 30, 1999, the Company received a total of $78,000 upon the
exercise of stock options for 13,000 shares. There were no stock options
exercised during the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1998.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion Number 25, ACCOUNTING
FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES ("APB 25") and related interpretations in
accounting for options granted, which requires compensation expense for the
Company's options to be recognized only if the market price of the underlying
stock exceeds the exercise price on the date of grant. Accordingly, the Company
has not recognized compensation expense for its options granted after 1994. SFAS
123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, issued in October 1995, requires
pro forma disclosures for option grants made after December 31, 1994, when
accounting for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with APB 25.

NOTE 11. STOCK OPTIONS  (CONTINUED)

If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair
value of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, net
income and earnings per common share would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts shown below:

</TABLE>


The pro forma effects are determined as if compensation costs were recognized
using the fair value based accounting method. The fair values of options granted
during 1999 and 1998 were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of
4.75% and 4.75%; expected lives of 10 years; expected volatility of 29% and 30%;
and a zero percent dividend yield. The weighted-average fair value of options
granted during 1999 and 1998 was $3.98 and $4.67, respectively.

information, for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 follows:

NOTE 13.  PENSION PLAN

The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan which covers
substantially all United States employees. On January 31, 2000, the Plan
Trustees approved the modification of the then existing plan. Effective
January 1, 2000, the plan was restated as a discretionary 401(k) Profit
Sharing Plan and has been renamed the Todhunter International, Inc.
Compensation Deferral 401(k) Plan (the "restated plan"). Under the restated
plan, participants may make elective contributions to the restated plan in
amounts up to 15% of their eligible compensation. Participants are
immediately vested in any elective contributions and its related earnings, if
any. Generally, employer contributions to the plan begin to vest to the
benefit of the participant after three years of service. Participants are
entitled, upon retirement, to their vested portion of the retirement fund
assets. The Company contributed $644,749, $644,022 and $669,866 to the plan
for the years ended September 30, 2000 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Under the old plan, the Company contributed 6.0% of an employee's total
compensation, plus 5.5% of compensation in excess of the social security tax
wage base. An employee's compensation in excess of $160,000 was disregarded
in determining the Company's contribution. Generally, employer contributions
to the plan began to vest to the benefit of the participant after three years
of service. Participants were entitled, upon retirement, to their vested
portion of the retirement fund assets.

NOTE 14.  INVESTMENT IN PREMIER WINES & SPIRITS, LTD.

In 1997, the Company acquired a 45% interest in Premier Wines & Spirits,
Ltd., ("Premier"), a wholesale liquor distributor in the United States Virgin
Islands, for $450,000. This investment is being accounted for using the
equity method. The Company had sales to Premier of approximately $2,069,000,
$1,808,000 and $1,490,000 for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Included in trade receivables is approximately $709,000
and $518,000 as of September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, related to
these sales. The Company has outstanding advances to Premier of $437,019 and
$1,073,115 as of September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, which are
included in investments in and advances to equity investees. These advances
are unsecured and bear interest at 8.5%. Interest payments are due monthly or
on demand in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Principal is payable
on demand. During fiscal year 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved
a resolution to convert $1,000,000 of these advances into an additional
investment in Premier. The other stockholders of Premier also made pro-rata
additional investments, so the Company's percentage ownership was not changed.

NOTE 15.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

  The carrying amounts approximate fair values as of September 30, 2000 and
  1999 for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade
  receivables, other receivables and accounts payable because of the
  short-term maturities of those instruments.

  NOTES RECEIVABLE: The fair value of the Company's notes receivable has been
  determined based on available market information and management's estimate of
  current market conditions of similar instruments.

  LONG-TERM DEBT: The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated
  based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same
  remaining maturities with similar collateral requirements.

</TABLE>

The Company assumed a noncancelable lease on Monarch's plant facility which
has since been abandoned by the Company. The net present value of this lease
at the date of purchase was recorded as a liability and increased goodwill,
accordingly.

The purchase price of $23.8 million includes $22.5 million of goodwill which
is being amortized over 20 years.

The following unaudited pro forma summary presents the consolidated results
of operations as if the acquisition had been made as of October 1, 1998.
These results do not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had
the acquisition actually been made as of such date or of results which may
occur in the future.
