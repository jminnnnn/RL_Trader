ITEM I.  BUSINESS

         GENERAL

         The Macerich Company (the "Company") is involved in the acquisition,
ownership, redevelopment, management and leasing of regional and community
shopping centers located throughout the United States. The Company is the
sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in,
The Macerich Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the
"Operating Partnership"). The Operating Partnership owns or has an ownership
interest in 47 regional shopping centers and five community shopping centers
aggregating approximately 42 million square feet of gross leasable area
("GLA"). These 52 regional and community shopping centers are referred to
hereinafter as the "Centers", unless the context otherwise requires. The
Company is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust
("REIT") and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership
and the Company's three management companies, Macerich Property Management
Company, a California corporation, Macerich Manhattan Management Company, a
California corporation, and Macerich Management Company, a California
corporation (collectively, the "Management Companies").

         The Company was organized as a Maryland corporation in September
1993 to continue and expand the shopping center operations of Mace Siegel,
Arthur M. Coppola, Dana K. Anderson and Edward C. Coppola and certain of
their business associates.

         All references to the Company in this Form 10-K include the Company,
those entities owned or controlled by the Company and predecessors of the
Company, unless the context indicates otherwise.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

         A. ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURE DEVELOPMENTS

         On February 18, 1999, the Company, through a 51/49 joint venture
with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (" Ontario Teachers' ") closed on
the first phase of a two phase acquisition of a portfolio of properties. The
phase one closing included the acquisition of three regional malls, the
retail component of a mixed-use development, five contiguous properties and
two non-contiguous community shopping centers comprising approximately 3.6
million square feet for a total purchase price of approximately $427.0
million. The purchase price was funded with a $120.0 million loan placed
concurrently with the closing, $140.4 million of debt from an affiliate of
the seller, and $39.4 million of assumed debt. The balance of the purchase
price was paid in cash. The Company's share of the cash component was funded
with the proceeds from two refinancings of centers and borrowings under the
Company's line of credit. On July 12, 1999, the Company closed on the second
phase of the acquisition. The second phase consisted of the acquisition of
the office component of the mixed-use development for a purchase price of
approximately $111.0 million. The purchase price was funded with a $76.7
million loan placed concurrently with the closing and the balance was paid in
cash. The Company's share of the cash component was funded from borrowings
under the Company's line of credit. The two non-contiguous community shopping
centers were subsequently sold in October and November of 1999.

         On June 2, 1999, Macerich Cerritos, LLC, ("Cerritos") a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Macerich Management Company, acquired Los Cerritos Center, a
1,304,262 square foot super regional mall in Cerritos, California. The total
purchase price was $188.0 million, which was funded with $120.0 million of
debt placed concurrently with the closing and a $70.8 million loan from the
Company. The Company funded this loan from borrowings under a $60.0 million
bank loan agreement and the balance from the Company's line of credit.

         On October 26, 1999, 49% of the membership interests of Macerich
Stonewood, LLC ("Stonewood"), Cerritos and Macerich Lakewood, LLC ("Lakewood")
were sold to Ontario Teachers' and concurrently Ontario Teachers' and the
Company contributed their 99% collective membership interests in Stonewood
and Cerritos and 100% of their collective membership interests in Lakewood to
Pacific Premier Retail Trust ("PPRT"), a real estate investment trust, owned
approximately 51% by the Company and 49% by Ontario Teachers. Lakewood,
Stonewood and Cerritos, own Lakewood Mall, Stonewood Mall and Los Cerritos
Center, respectively. The total value of the transaction was approximately
$535.0 million. The properties were contributed to PPRT subject to existing
debt of $322.0 million. The net cash proceeds to the Company were
approximately $104.0 million which were used for reduction of debt and for
general corporate purposes.

         On October 29, 1999, Macerich Santa Monica, LLC, a wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary of the Company, acquired Santa Monica Place, a 560,623
square foot regional mall located in Santa Monica, California. The total
purchase price was $130.8 million, which was funded with $80.0 million of
debt placed concurrently with the closing with the balance funded from
proceeds from the PPRT transaction described above.

a fixed rate of 8.22% and maturing March 1, 2009.

         On April 30, 1999, the Company refinanced the debt on Carmel Plaza.

Corte Madera. A $60.0 million floating rate loan was paid in full and a new
note was issued for $72.0 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.75%
and maturing November 1, 2009.

         C. OTHER EVENTS

         On November 15, 1999, the Company redeemed $25.1 million of
Operating Partnership Units ("OP Units") of the Operating Partnership for
cash from various unit holders. A total of 1,266,687 of OP Units were
redeemed for cash at the Company's option in lieu of exchanging common stock
for OP Units.

         On November 16, 1999, the Company sold Huntington Center. Huntington
Center is a shopping center located in Huntington Beach, California, that was
purchased by the Company in December 1996. The Center was purchased as part
of a package with Fresno Fashion Fair in Fresno, California, and Pacific View
(formerly know as Buenaventura Mall) in Ventura, California. The Center was
sold for $48.0 million and the net cash proceeds from the sale were used for
general corporate purposes.

THE SHOPPING CENTER INDUSTRY

         GENERAL

         There are several types of retail shopping centers, which are
differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. Regional
shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of GLA,
are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores
("Anchors") and are referred to as "Regional Shopping Centers" or "Malls".
Regional Shopping Centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail
stores ("Mall Stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers
typically located along corridors connecting the Anchors. Community Shopping
Centers, also referred to as "strip centers," are retail shopping centers
that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are
typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores
and/or drug stores. Community Shopping Centers typically contain 100,000
square feet to 400,000 square feet of GLA. In addition, freestanding retail
stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("Freestanding
Stores"). Anchors, Mall and Freestanding Stores and other tenants typically
contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes,
insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the
shopping center.

         REGIONAL SHOPPING CENTERS

         A Regional Shopping Center draws from its trade area by offering a
variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment,
generally in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient
parking. Regional Shopping Centers provide an array of retail shops and
entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and the preferred
gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events.

         The Company focuses on the acquisition and redevelopment of Regional
Shopping Centers. Regional Shopping Centers have generally provided owners
with relatively stable growth in income despite the cyclical nature of the
retail business. This stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and
to the typical dominance of Regional Shopping Centers in their trade areas.
Regional Shopping Centers are difficult to develop because of the significant
barriers to entry, including the limited availability of capital and suitable
development sites, the presence of existing Regional Shopping Centers in most
markets, a limited number of Anchors, and the associated development costs
and risks. Consequently, the Company believes that few new Regional Shopping
Centers will be built in the next five years. However, many of the market,
financing and economic risks typically associated with the development of new
Regional Shopping Centers can be mitigated by acquiring and redeveloping an
existing Regional Shopping Center. Furthermore, the value of Regional
Shopping Centers can be significantly enhanced through redevelopment,
renovation and expansion.


                                        2

<PAGE>

         REGIONAL SHOPPING CENTERS - CONTINUED:

         Regional Shopping Centers have different strategies with regard to
price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet
the needs of their trade areas. Anchor tenants are located along common areas
in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of
the Mall Stores. Mall GLA, which generally refers to gross leasable area
contiguous to the Anchors for tenants other than Anchors, is leased to a wide
variety of smaller retailers. Mall Stores typically account for the bulk of
the revenues of a Regional Shopping Center.

         Although a variety of retail formats compete for consumer purchases,
the Company believes that Regional Shopping Centers will continue to be a
preferred shopping destination. The combination of a climate controlled
shopping environment, a dominant location, and a diverse tenant mix has
resulted in Regional Shopping Centers generating higher tenant sales than are
generally achieved at smaller retail formats. Further, the Company believes
that department stores located in Regional Shopping Centers will continue to
provide a full range of current fashion merchandise at a limited number of
locations in any one market, allowing them to command the largest
geographical trade area of any retail format.

         COMMUNITY SHOPPING CENTERS

         Community Shopping Centers are designed to attract local and
neighborhood customers and are typically open air shopping centers, with one
or more supermarkets, drugstores or discount department stores. National
retailers such as Kids-R-Us at Bristol Shopping Center, Toys-R-Us at Boulder
Plaza, Saks Fifth Avenue at Carmel Plaza and The Gap, Victoria's Secret and
Express/Bath and Body at Villa Marina, provide the Company's Community
Shopping Centers with the opportunity to draw from a much larger trade area
than a typical supermarket or drugstore anchored Community Shopping Center.

BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY

         MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING PHILOSOPHY

         The Company believes that the shopping center business requires
specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and
profitable operations. For this reason, the Company has developed a fully
integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, redevelopment,
property management, leasing, finance, construction, marketing, legal and
accounting expertise. In addition, the Company emphasizes a philosophy of
decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site
professionals. The Company believes that this strategy results in the optimal
operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each Center as well as the ability
to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the Center's trade
area.

         PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND LEASING. The Company believes that on-site
property managers can most effectively operate the Centers. Each Center's
property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing,
maintenance and security functions at the Center. Property managers focus
special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the
profitability of the Centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with
and to be responsive to the needs of retailers.

         The Company believes strongly in decentralized leasing and
accordingly, most of its leasing managers are located on-site to better
understand the market and the community in which a Center is located. Leasing
managers are charged with more than the responsibility of leasing space; they
continually assess and fine tune each Center's tenant mix, identify and
replace under performing tenants and seek to optimize existing tenant sizes
and configurations.

         ACQUISITIONS. Since its initial public offering ("IPO"), the Company
has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. These acquisitions
were identified and consummated by the Company's staff of acquisition
professionals who are strategically located in Santa Monica, Dallas, Denver,
and Atlanta. The Company believes that it is geographically well positioned
to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and
financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities
arise. The Company focuses on assets that are or can be dominant in their
trade area, have a franchise and where there is intrinsic value.

         The Company made the following acquisitions in 1998: The Company
along with a 50/50 joint venture partner, acquired a portfolio of twelve
regional malls totaling 10.7 million square feet on February 27, 1998; South
Plains Mall in Lubbock, Texas on June 19,1998; Westside Pavilion in Los
Angeles, California on July 1, 1998; Village at Corte Madera in Corte Madera,
California in June and July 1998; Carmel Plaza in Carmel, California on
August 10, 1998; and Northwest Arkansas Mall in Fayetteville, Arkansas on
December 15, 1998. Together, these properties are known as the "1998
Acquisition Centers."


                                        3

<PAGE>

         MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING PHILOSOPHY - CONTINUED:

         On February 18, 1999, the Company, along with a joint venture
partner, acquired a portfolio of three regional malls, the retail component
of a mixed-use development, five contiguous properties and two non-contiguous
community shopping centers totaling approximately 3.6 million square feet.
The Company is a 51% owner of this portfolio. The second phase of this
transaction, which closed on July 12, 1999, consisted of the acquisition of
the office component of the mixed-use development. The two non-contiguous
community shopping centers were subsequently sold in October and November of
1999. Additionally, the Company acquired Los Cerritos Center in Cerritos,
California, on June 2, 1999 and Santa Monica Place in Santa Monica,
California, on October 29, 1999. Together, these properties are known as the
"1999 Acquisition Centers."

         REDEVELOPMENT. One of the major components of the Company's growth
strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. For this reason,
the Company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary
responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that will result
in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the Centers.
The redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the
projects in addition to obtaining required governmental and Anchor approvals.

         THE CENTERS. As of December 31, 1999, the Centers consist of 47
Regional Shopping Centers and five Community Shopping Centers aggregating
approximately 42 million square feet of GLA. The 47 Regional Shopping Centers
in the Company's portfolio average approximately 874,000 square feet of GLA
and range in size from 1.8 million square feet of GLA at Lakewood Mall to
324,959 square feet of GLA at Panorama Mall. The Company's five Community
Shopping Centers, Boulder Plaza, Bristol Shopping Center, Carmel Plaza, Great
Falls Marketplace and Villa Marina Marketplace, have an average of 213,523
square feet of GLA. The 47 Regional Shopping Centers presently include 184
Anchors totaling approximately 23.1 million square feet of GLA and
approximately 6,050 Mall and Freestanding Stores totaling approximately 19.1
million square feet of GLA.

         Total revenues increased from $283.9 million in 1998 to $327.4
million in 1999 primarily due to the 1999 and 1998 acquisitions. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations." Lakewood Mall generated 10.5% of total shopping center revenues
in 1997. No Center generated more than 10% of shopping center revenues during
1998 and 1999.

         COST OF OCCUPANCY

         The Company's management believes that in order to maximize the
Company's operating cash flow, the Centers' Mall Store tenants must be able
to operate profitably. A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is
cost of occupancy. The following table summarizes occupancy costs for Mall
Store tenants in the Centers as a percentage of total Mall Store sales for
the last three years:

         COMPETITION

         The 47 Regional Shopping Centers are generally located in developed
areas in middle to upper income markets where there are relatively few other
Regional Shopping Centers. In addition, 46 of the 47 Regional Shopping
Centers contain more than 400,000 square feet of GLA. The Company intends to
consider additional expansion and renovation projects to maintain and enhance
the quality of the Centers and their competitive position in their trade
areas.

         There are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete
with the Company in its trade areas. There are nine other publicly traded
mall companies, any of which under certain circumstances, could compete
against the Company for an acquisition, an Anchor or a tenant. This results
in competition for both acquisition of centers and for tenants to occupy
space. The existence of competing shopping centers could have a material
impact on the Company's ability to lease space and on the level of rent that
can be achieved. There is also increasing competition from other forms of
retail, such as factory outlet centers, power centers, discount shopping
clubs, mail-order services, internet shopping and home shopping networks that
could adversely affect the Company's revenues.

         MAJOR TENANTS

         The Centers derived approximately 90.2% of their total rents for the
year ended December 31, 1999 from Mall and Freestanding Stores. One tenant
accounted for approximately 5.2% of annual base rents of the Company, and no
other single tenant accounted for more than 3.2%, as of December 31, 1999.

         The following tenants (including their subsidiaries) represent the
10 largest tenants in the Company's portfolio (including joint ventures)
based upon minimum rents in place as of December 31, 1999:

           MALL AND FREESTANDING STORES

           Mall and Freestanding Store leases generally provide for tenants
to pay rent comprised of a fixed base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage
rent based on sales. In some cases, tenants pay only a fixed minimum rent,
and in some cases, tenants pay only percentage rents. Most leases for Mall
and Freestanding Stores contain provisions that allow the Centers to recover
their costs for maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance,
advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the Center.

           The Company uses tenant spaces 10,000 square feet and under for
comparing rental rate activity. Tenant space 10,000 square feet and under in
the portfolio at December 31, 1999, comprises 76.9% of all Mall and
Freestanding Store space. The Company believes that to include space over
10,000 square feet would provide a less meaningful comparison.

           When an existing lease expires, the Company is often able to enter
into a new lease with a higher base rent component. The average base rent for
new Mall and Freestanding Store leases, 10,000 square feet or under,
commencing during 1999 was $29.76 per square foot, or 16% higher than the
average base rent for all Mall and Freestanding Stores (10,000 square feet or
under) at December 31, 1999 of $25.60 per square foot.

</TABLE>

(1)   Average base rent per square foot is based on Mall and Freestanding Store
      GLA for spaces 10,000 square feet or under occupied as of December 31 for
      each of the Centers owned by the Company in 1997 (excluding the 1997
      Acquisition Centers), 1998 (excluding the 1998 Acquisition Centers), and
      1999 (excluding the 1999 Acquisition Centers).

(2)   The base rent on lease signings during the year represents the actual rent
      to be paid on a per square foot basis during the first twelve months. The
      1997 average excludes the 1997 Acquisition Centers, the 1998 average
      excludes the 1998 Acquisition Centers and the 1999 average excludes the
      1999 Acquisition Centers.

(3)   The average base rent on leases expiring during the year represents the
      final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for all tenant leases 10,000
      square feet or under expiring during the year. On a comparable space
      basis, average initial rents, excluding the impact of straight lining of
      rent, on leases 10,000 square feet or under commencing in 1999 was $30.85
      compared to expiring rents of $27.29. The average base rent on leases
      expiring in 1997 excludes the 1997 Acquisition Centers, the average for
      1998 excludes 1998 Acquisition Centers and the average for 1999 excludes
      the 1999 Acquisition Centers.

      BANKRUPTCY AND/OR CLOSURE OF RETAIL STORES

         The bankruptcy and/or closure of an Anchor, or its sale to a less
desirable retailer, could adversely affect customer traffic in a Center and
thereby reduce the income generated by that Center. Furthermore, the closing
of an Anchor could, under certain circumstances, allow certain other Anchors
or other tenants to terminate their leases or cease operating their stores at
the Center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the Center.

         Retail stores at the Centers other than Anchors may also seek the
protection of the bankruptcy laws and/or close stores, which could result in
the termination of such tenants' leases and thus cause a reduction in the
cash flow generated by the Centers. Although no single retailer accounts for
greater than 5.2% of total rents, the bankruptcy and/or closure of stores
could result in decreased occupancy levels, reduced rental income or
otherwise adversely impact the Centers. Although certain tenants have filed
for bankruptcy, the Company does not believe such filings and any subsequent
closures of their stores will have a material adverse impact on its
operations.

         ANCHORS

         Anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's
identification with Regional Shopping Centers. Anchors are generally department
stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. Although the
Centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from Anchors than
from Mall and Freestanding Stores, strong Anchors play an important part in
maintaining customer traffic and making the Centers desirable locations for Mall
and Freestanding Store tenants.

         Anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases
adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates
that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of Mall and Freestanding
Stores. Each Anchor which owns its own store, and certain Anchors which lease
their stores, enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the
Center covering among other things, operational matters, initial construction
and future expansion.

         Anchors accounted for approximately 9.8% of the Company's total rent
for the year ended December 31, 1999.

         The following table identifies each Anchor, each parent company that
owns multiple Anchors and the number of square feet owned or leased by each such
Anchor or parent company in the Company's portfolio at December 31, 1999:

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and
regulations, a current or prior owner or operator of real estate may be liable
for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances
on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose such liability without
regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the
presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigation,
removal or remediation of such substances may be substantial, and the presence
of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may
adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent such property
or to borrow using such property as collateral. Persons or entities who arrange
for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be
liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a release of such substances
at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or
operated by such person or entity. Certain environmental laws impose liability
for release of asbestos-containing materials ("ACMs") into the air and third
parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for
personal injury associated with exposure to ACMs. In connection with the
ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real
properties, the Company may be considered an owner or operator of such
properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or
toxic substances and therefore potentially liable for removal or remediation
costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental fines and
injuries to persons and property.

         Each of the Centers has been subjected to a Phase I audit (which
involves review of publicly available information and general property
inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis)
completed by an environmental consultant.

         Based on these audits, and on other information, the Company is aware
of the following environmental issues that are reasonably possible to result in
costs associated with future investigation or remediation, or in environmental
liability:

            -     ASBESTOS. The Company has conducted ACM surveys at various
                  locations within the Centers. The surveys indicate that ACMs
                  are present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl
                  floor tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape and
                  joint compounds. The identified ACMs are generally
                  non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities
                  for disturbance. At certain Centers where ACMs are present or
                  suspected, however, some ACMs have been or may be classified
                  as "friable," and ultimately may require removal under certain
                  conditions. The Company has developed and implemented an
                  operations and maintenance (O&M) plan to manage ACMs in place.

            -     UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS. Underground storage tanks ("USTs")
                  are or were present at certain of the Centers, often in
                  connection with tenant operations at gasoline stations or
                  automotive tire, battery and accessory service centers located
                  at such Centers. USTs also may be or have been present at
                  properties neighboring certain Centers. Some of these tanks
                  have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. Where
                  leakage has occurred, investigation, remediation, and
                  monitoring costs may be incurred by the Company if responsible
                  current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are
                  unavailable to pay such costs.

            -     CHLORINATED HYDROCARBONS. The presence of chlorinated
                  hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene ("PCE") and its
                  degradation byproducts have been detected at certain of the
                  Centers, often in connection with tenant dry cleaning
                  operations. Where PCE has been detected, the Company may incur
                  investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible
                  current or former tenants, or other responsible parties, are
                  unavailable to pay such costs.

         PCE has been detected in soil and groundwater in the vicinity of a dry
cleaning establishment at North Valley Plaza, formerly owned by a joint venture
of which the Company was a 50% member. The property was sold on December 18,
1997. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control ("DTSC") advised the
Company in 1995 that very low levels of Dichloroethylene ("1,2 DCE"), a
degradation byproduct of PCE, had been detected in a municipal water well
located 1/4 mile west of the dry cleaners, and that the dry cleaning facility
may have contributed to the introduction of 1,2 DCE into the water well.
According to DTSC, the maximum contaminant level ("MCL") for 1,2 DCE which is
permitted in drinking water is 6 parts per billion ("ppb"). The 1,2 DCE was
detected in the water well at a concentration of 1.2 ppb, which is below the
MCL. The Company has retained an environmental consultant and has initiated
extensive testing of the site. Remediation began in October 1997. The joint
venture agreed (between itself and the buyer) that it would be responsible for
continuing to pursue the investigation and remediation of impacted soil and
groundwater resulting from releases of PCE from the former dry cleaner. $149,466
and $153,100 have already been incurred by the joint venture for remediation,
and professional and legal fees for the periods ending December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. An additional $258,566 remains reserved by the joint venture
as of


                                       9

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, CONTINUED:

December 31, 1999. The joint venture has been sharing costs on a 50/50 basis
with a former owner of the property and intends to look to additional
responsible parties for recovery.

         The Company acquired Fresno Fashion Fair in December 1996. Asbestos has
been detected in structural fireproofing throughout much of the Center. Testing
data conducted by professional environmental consulting firms indicates that the
fireproofing is largely inaccessible to building occupants and is well adhered
to the structural members. Additionally, airborne concentrations of asbestos
were well within OSHA's permissible exposure limit ("PEL") of .1 fcc. The
accounting for this acquisition includes a reserve of $3.3 million to cover
future removal of this asbestos, as necessary. The Company incurred $90,876 and
$255,500 in remediation costs for the twelve months ending December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively.

INSURANCE

         The Company has comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage
and rental loss insurance with respect to the Centers. The Company or the joint
venture, as applicable, also currently carries earthquake insurance covering the
Centers located in California. Management believes that such insurance provides
adequate coverage.

QUALIFICATION AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST

         The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), commencing with its first taxable year
ended December 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue
to qualify as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Company generally will not
be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it
currently distributes to stockholders. Qualification and taxation as a REIT
depends on the Company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests,
share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the
Code.


EMPLOYEES

         The Company and the Management Companies employ approximately 1,651
persons, including eight executive officers, personnel in the areas of
acquisitions and business development (7), property management (270), leasing
(75), redevelopment/construction (25), financial services (49) and legal affairs
(31). In addition, in an effort to minimize operating costs, the Company
generally maintains its own security staff (572) and maintenance staff (614).
Approximately 6 of these employees are represented by a union. The Company
believes that relations with its employees are good.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES, CONTINUED

(1)   The land underlying thirty-seven of the Centers is owned in fee entirely
      by the Company or, in the case of jointly-owned Centers, by the joint
      venture property partnership or limited liability company. All or part of
      the land underlying the remaining Centers is owned by third parties and
      leased to the Company or property partnership pursuant to long-term ground
      leases. Under the terms of a typical ground lease, the Company or property
      partnership pays rent for the use of the land and is generally responsible
      for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements.
      In some cases, the Company or property partnership has an option or right
      of first refusal to purchase the land. The termination dates of the ground
      leases range from 2000 to 2070.

(2)   Includes GLA attributable to Anchors (whether owned or non-owned) and Mall
      and Freestanding Stores as of December 31, 1999.

(3)   Sales are based on reports by retailers leasing Mall and Freestanding
      Stores for the year ending December 31, 1999 for tenants which have
      occupied such stores for a minimum of twelve months. Consistent with
      industry practices, sales per square foot are based on gross leased and
      occupied area, excluding theaters, and are not based on GLA.

(4)   Portions of the land on which the Center is situated are subject to one or
      more ground leases.

(5)   During 1997, Montgomery Ward filed for bankruptcy and emerged from
      bankruptcy in late 1999. Montgomery Ward closed its stores at Holiday
      Village Mall, Rimrock Mall and Southridge Mall in 1999. The Montgomery
      Ward at Holiday Village is owned by Herbergers. Dillards owns the former
      Montgomery Ward Building at Rimrock.

(6)   These properties have a vacant Anchor location. The Company is
      contemplating various replacement tenant/redevelopment opportunities for
      these vacant sites.

(7)   Certain spaces have been intentionally held off the market and remain
      vacant because of major redevelopment plans. As a result, the Company
      believes the percentage of Mall and Freestanding GLA leased and the sales
      per square foot at these major redevelopment properties is not meaningful
      data.

(8)   The office portion of this mixed-use development does not have retail
      sales.

(9)   J.C. Penney is currently building a store at Chesterfield Mall.

(10)  Macy's is currently building a store at Lakewood Mall.

MORTGAGE DEBT, CONTINUED:

      Notes:

      (1)   The annual debt service payment represents the payment of principal
            and interest. In addition, contingent interest, as defined in the
            loan agreement, may be due to the extent that 35% of the gross
            receipts (as defined in the loan agreement) exceeds a base amount
            specified therein. Contingent interest recognized was $385,556 for
            the year ended December 31, 1999 and $387,101 for the year ended
            December 31, 1998.

      (2)   The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%. At December 31, 1999,
            the total interest rate was 7.16%. In addition, the Company can,
            subject to certain conditions, increase the borrowing amount up to
            $90.0 million. As of January 6, 2000, an additional $5.0 million was
            advanced for total borrowings outstanding of $85.0 million.

      (3)   Reflects the Company's pro rata share of debt.

      (4)   In connection with the acquisition of this Center, the joint venture
            assumed $39.4 million of debt. At acquisition, this debt was
            recorded at the fair value of $41.5 million which included an
            unamortized premium of $2.1 million. This premium is being amortized
            as interest expense over the life of the loan using the effective
            interest method. The joint venture's monthly debt service is
            $349,000 and is calculated using an 8.60% interest rate. At December
            31, 1999, the joint venture's unamortized premium was $1.4 million.

      (5)   The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%. At December 31, 1999,
            the total interest rate was 8.23%.

      (6)   In connection with the acquisition of these Centers, the joint
            venture assumed $485 million of mortgage notes payable which are
            secured by the properties. At acquisition, this debt reflected a
            fair value of $322.7 million, which included an unamortized
            premium of $22.7 million. This premium is being amortized as
            interest expense over the life of the loan using the effective
            interest method. At December 31, 1999, the unamortized balance of
            the debt premium was $18.6 million. This debt is due in May 2006 and
            requires a monthly payment of $1.9 million. $185 million of this
            debt is due in May 2003 and requires monthly interest payments at
            a variable weighted average rate (based on LIBOR) of 6.96% at
            December 31, 1999. This variable rate debt is covered by an
            interest rate cap agreement which effectively prevents the
            interest rate from exceeding 11.53%.

         The Company has a credit facility of $150 million with a maturity of
February 2001, currently bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.15%. The interest rate
on such credit facility fluctuates between 0.95% and 1.15% over LIBOR. As of
December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, $57.4 million and $137.0 million of
borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit at interest rates of 7.65%
and 6.79%, respectively.

         Additionally, the Company issued $776,000 in letters of credit
guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations. The Company does
not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the
Company.

         During January 1999, the Company entered into a bank construction loan
agreement to fund $89.2 million of costs related to the redevelopment of Pacific
View. See "Item 2. Properties." The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% and
matures in February 2001. Principal is drawn as construction costs are incurred.
As of December 31, 1999, $72.7 million of principal has been drawn under the
loan.

         In addition, the Company had a note payable of $30.6 million due in
February 2000 payable to the seller of the acquired portfolio. The note bore
interest at 6.5%. The loan was paid in full on February 18, 2000.

         During 1997, the Company issued and sold $161.4 million of convertible
subordinated debentures (the "Debentures") due 2002. The Debentures, which were
sold at par, bear interest at 7.25% annually (payable semi-annually) and are
convertible at any time, on or after 60 days, from the date of issue at a
conversion price of $31.125 per share. The Debentures mature on December 15,
2002 and are callable by the Company after June 15, 2002 at par plus accrued
interest.

Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

         On August 27, 1999, the Company issued 10,000 shares of common stock
upon the redemption of 10,000 OP Units in a private placement to a limited
partner of the Operating Partnership, an accredited investor, pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

         The following sets forth selected financial data for the Company on a
historical basis. The following data should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements (and the notes thereto) of the Company and "Management's
Discussion And Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" each
included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

         The Selected Financial Data is presented on a consolidated basis. The
limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (not owned by the
REIT) are reflected as minority interest. Centers in which the Company does not
have a controlling ownership interest (Panorama Mall, North Valley Plaza,
Broadway Plaza, Manhattan Village, Pacific Premier Retail Trust, SDG Macerich
Properties, L.P. and West Acres Shopping Center) are referred to as the "Joint
Venture Centers", and along with the Management Companies, are reflected in the
selected financial data under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the
net income from the Joint Venture Centers and the Management Companies that is
allocable to the Company is included in the statement of operations as "Equity
in income (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures and Management Companies."

      million of its Series B Preferred Stock. The preferred stock can be
      converted on a one-for-one basis for common stock. The preferred stock

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL BACKGROUND AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

         The Company believes that the most significant measures of its
operating performance are Funds from Operations and EBITDA. Funds from
Operations is defined as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP),
excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales or write-down of
assets, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal
property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs), and after
adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities
are calculated on the same basis. Funds from Operations does not represent cash
flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of
cash available to fund all cash flow needs.

         EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation,
amortization, minority interest, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated
entities, extraordinary items, gain (loss) on sale of assets and preferred
dividends. This data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the
shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to
service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations. EBITDA should not be
construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's
operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined
in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. While the performance of
individual Centers and the Management Companies determines EBITDA, the Company's
capital structure also influences Funds from Operations. The most important
component in determining EBITDA and Funds from Operations is Center revenues.
Center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents, percentage rents and tenant
expense recoveries. Minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases
are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents. Minimum rents will
also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level. Additionally, to
the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery
terms, expense recoveries will increase.

         Percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant
sales. As leases roll over, however, a portion of historical percentage rent is
often converted to minimum rent. It is therefore common for percentage rents to
decrease as minimum rents increase. Accordingly, in discussing financial
performance, the Company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to
better measure revenue growth.

         The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998
and 1997. The following discussion compares the activity for the year ended
December 31, 1999 to results of operations for 1998. Also included is a
comparison of the activities for the year ended December 31, 1998 to the results
for the year ended December 31, 1997. This information should be read in
conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS - CONTINUED:


         Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below,
occurred due to the addition of these properties to the portfolio during 1999
and 1998. Many factors impact the Company's ability to acquire additional
properties; including the availability and cost of capital, the overall debt to
market capitalization level, interest rates and availability of potential
acquisition targets that meet the Company's criteria. Accordingly, management is
uncertain whether during the balance of 2000, and in future years, there will be
similar acquisitions and corresponding increases in revenues, net income and FFO
that occurred as a result of the 1999 and 1998 Acquisition Centers. Management
anticipates the pace of acquisitions to slow considerably in 2000 compared to
1999 and 1998. Pacific View (formerly known as Buenaventura Mall), Crossroads
Mall-Boulder, Huntington Center and Parklane Mall are currently under
redevelopment and are referred to herein as the "Redevelopment Centers."
Huntington Center was sold on November 16, 1999. All other Centers, excluding
the 1999 and 1998 Acquisition Centers and Redevelopment Centers, are referred to
herein as the "Same Centers", unless the context otherwise requires.

         The bankruptcy and/or closure of an Anchor, or its sale to a less
desirable retailer, could adversely affect customer traffic in a Center and
thereby reduce the income generated by that Center. Furthermore, the closing of
an Anchor could, under certain circumstances, allow certain other Anchors or
other tenants to terminate their leases or cease operating their stores at the
Center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the Center. Other retail
stores at the Centers may also seek the protection of bankruptcy laws and/or
close stores, which could result in the termination of such tenants leases and
thus cause a reduction in cash flow generated by the Centers.

         In addition, the Company's success in the highly competitive real
estate shopping center business depends upon many other factors, including
general economic conditions, the ability of tenants to make rent payments,
increases or decreases in operating expenses, occupancy levels, changes in
demographics, competition from other centers and forms of retailing and the
ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or termination of
leases.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

         Total assets increased to $2,404 million at December 31, 1999 compared
to $2,322 million at December 31, 1998 and $1,505 million at December 31, 1997.
During that same period, total liabilities increased from $1,188 million in 1997
to $1,579 million in 1998 and $1,626 million in 1999. These changes were
primarily a result of the 1998 common stock offerings of 7,920,181 shares, the
1998 preferred stock offerings of 9,114,602 shares, the 1997 offering of $161.4
million of debentures, the purchase of the 1999, 1998 and 1997 Acquisition
Centers and related debt transactions.


A. ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURE DEVELOPMENTS

         On February 18, 1999, the Company, through a 51/49 joint venture with
Ontario Teachers closed on the first phase of a two phase acquisition of a
portfolio of properties. The phase one closing included the acquisition of three
regional malls, the retail component of a mixed-use development, five contiguous
properties and two non-contiguous community shopping centers comprising
approximately 3.6 million square feet for a total purchase price of
approximately $427.0 million. The purchase price was funded with a $120.0
million loan placed concurrently with the closing, $140.4 million of debt from
an affiliate of the seller, and $39.4 million of assumed debt. The balance of
the purchase price was paid in cash. The Company's share of the cash component
was funded with the proceeds from two refinancings of Centers and borrowings
under the Company's line of credit. On July 12, 1999, the Company closed on the
second phase of the acquisition. The second phase consisted of the acquisition
of the office component of the mixed-use development for a purchase price of
approximately $111.0 million. The purchase price was funded with a $76.7 million
loan placed concurrently with the closing and the balance was paid in cash. The
Company's share of the cash component was funded from borrowings under the
Company's line of credit. The two non-contiguous community shopping centers were
subsequently sold in October and November of 1999.

         On June 2, 1999, Cerritos, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Macerich
Management Company, acquired Los Cerritos Center, a 1,304,262 square foot super
regional mall in Cerritos, California. The total purchase price was $188.0
million, which was funded with $120.0 million of debt placed concurrently with
the closing and a $70.8 million loan from the Company. The Company funded this
loan from borrowings under a $60.0 million bank loan agreement and the balance
from the Company's line of credit.

         On October 26, 1999, 49% of the membership interests of Stonewood,
Cerritos and Lakewood were sold to Ontario Teachers' and concurrently Ontario
Teachers' and the Company contributed their 99% collective membership
interests in Stonewood and Cerritos and 100% of their collective membership
interests in Lakewood to PPRT, a real estate investment trust, owned
approximately 51% by the Company and 49% by Ontario Teachers. Lakewood,
Stonewood, and Cerritos own Lakewood Mall, Stonewood Mall and Los Cerritos
Center, respectively. The total value of the transaction was approximately
$535.0 million. The properties were contributed to PPRT subject to existing
debt of $322.0 million. The net cash proceeds to the Company were
approximately $104.0 million which were used for reduction of debt and for
general corporate purposes.

         On October 29, 1999, Macerich Santa Monica, LLC, a wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary of the Company, acquired Santa Monica Place, a 560,623
square foot regional mall located in Santa Monica, California. The total

debt placed concurrently with the closing with the balance funded from
proceeds from the PPRT transaction described above.

B. REFINANCINGS

         On February 4, 1999, the Company refinanced the debt on Queens Center.

of the Operating Partnership for cash from various unit holders. A total of
1,266,687 of OP Units were redeemed for cash at the Company's option in lieu
of exchanging common stock for OP Units.

         On November 16, 1999, the Company sold Huntington Center. Huntington
Center is a shopping center located in Huntington Beach, California, that was
purchased by the Company in December 1996. The Center was purchased as part of a

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND 1998

      REVENUES

            Minimum and percentage rents increased by 14.1% to $219.7 million in
      1999 from $192.6 million in 1998. Approximately $26.3 million of the
      increase resulted from the 1998 Acquisition Centers, $1.9 million from the
      1999 acquisition of Santa Monica Place and $5.2 million of the increase
      was attributable to the Same Centers. These increases were partially
      offset by revenue decreases at the Redevelopment Centers of $2.1 million
      in 1999 and $4.2 million of the decrease related to the contribution of
      100% and 99% of the membership interests of Lakewood Mall and Stonewood
      Mall, respectively, to the PPRT joint venture on October 26,1999.

            Tenant recoveries increased to $99.1 million in 1999 from $86.7
      million in 1998. The 1998 Acquisition Centers generated $12.9 million of
      this increase, $1.3 million was from the acquisition of Santa Monica
      Place, and $1.9 million of the increase was from the Same Centers. These
      increases were partially offset by revenue decreases at the Redevelopment
      Centers of $2.1 million in 1999 and $1.6 million of the decrease resulted
      from the contribution of Lakewood Mall and Stonewood Mall to the PPRT
      joint venture.

            Other income increased to $8.6 million in 1999 from $4.5 million in
      1998. Approximately $0.7 million of the increase related to the 1998
      Acquisition Centers and the 1999 acquisition of Santa Monica Place, and
      $3.7 million of the increase was attributable to the Same Centers.

      EXPENSES

            Shopping center expenses increased to $100.3 million in 1999
      compared to $90.0 million in 1998. Approximately $13.2 million of the
      increase resulted from the 1998 Acquisition Centers and the 1999
      acquisition of Santa Monica Place and $1.1 million of the increase
      resulted from increased property taxes and recoverable expenses at the
      Same Centers. The Redevelopment Centers had a net decrease of $2.0 million
      in shopping center expenses resulting primarily from decreased property
      taxes and recoverable expenses. The contribution of Lakewood Mall and
      Stonewood Mall to the PPRT joint venture resulted in $2.0 million of this
      decrease.

            General and administrative expenses increased to $5.5 million in
      1999 from $4.4 million in 1998 primarily as a result of the accounting
      change required by EITF 97-11, "Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to
      Real Estate Property Acquisitions," which requires the expensing of
      internal acquisition costs. Previously in accordance with GAAP, certain
      internal acquisition costs were capitalized. The increase is also
      attributable to higher executive and director compensation expense.

      INTEREST EXPENSE

            Interest expense increased to $113.3 million in 1999 from $91.4
      million in 1998. This increase of $22.1 million is primarily attributable
      to the acquisition activity in 1998 and 1999, which was partially funded
      with secured debt and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.

      DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

            Depreciation increased to $61.4 million from $53.1 million in 1998.
      This increase relates primarily to the 1998 and 1999 Acquisition Centers.

      MINORITY INTEREST

            The minority interest represents the 26.3% weighted average interest
      of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during
      1999. This compares to 28.4% not owned by the Company during 1998.

      INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES

            The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the Management
      Companies was $25.9 million for 1999, compared to income of $14.5 million
      in 1998. A total of $3.2 million of the change is attributable to the 1998
      acquisitions of SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. and $7.9 million of the
      change is attributable to the 1999 acquisitions by Pacific Premier Retail
      Trust.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUED:

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND 1998

      GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS

            A gain on sale of assets of $96.0 million is a result of the Company
      selling approximately 49% of the membership interests of Stonewood and
      Lakewood to Ontario Teachers' in October 1999 and the Company's sale
      of Huntington Center on November 16, 1999.

      EXTRAORDINARY LOSS FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT

            In 1999, the Company wrote off $1.5 million of unamortized financing
      costs, compared to $2.4 million written off in 1998.

      NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

            As a result of the foregoing, including the gain on sale of assets,
      net income available to common stockholders increased to $110.9 million in
      1999 from $32.5 million in 1998.

      OPERATING ACTIVITIES

            Cash flow from operations was $139.6 million in 1999 compared to
      $85.2 million in 1998. The increase is primarily because of increased net
      operating income from the 1998 and 1999 Acquisition Centers.

      INVESTING ACTIVITIES

            Cash flow used in investing activities was $247.7 million in 1999
      compared to $761.1 million in 1998. The change resulted primarily from the
      cash contributions required by the Company for the joint venture
      acquisitions of $240.2 million in 1998 compared to $116.9 million in 1999,
      and the proceeds from the sale of assets in 1999 of $106.9 million.

      FINANCING ACTIVITIES

            Cash flow from financing activities was $123.4 million in 1999
      compared to $676.0 million in 1998. The decrease resulted from no equity
      offerings in 1999 compared to 7,920,181 shares of common stock sold in
      1998. Additionally, 9,114,602 shares of preferred stock were sold in the
      first and second quarters of 1998.

      EBITDA AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

            Primarily because of the factors mentioned above, EBITDA increased
      16.9% to $221.6 million in 1999 from $189.5 million in 1998 and Funds from
      Operations - Diluted increased 36.3% to $164.3 million from $120.5 million
      in 1998.

      REVENUES

            Minimum and percentage rents increased by 27% to $192.6 million in
      1998 from $151.5 million in 1997. Approximately $18.9 million of the
      increase resulted from the 1997 Acquisition Centers, $18.8 million
      resulted from the 1998 Acquisition Centers and $5.0 million of the
      increase was attributable to the Same Centers. These increases were
      partially offset by revenue decreases at the Redevelopment Centers of $1.6
      million in 1998.

            Tenant recoveries increased to $86.7 million in 1998 from $66.5
      million in 1997. The 1998 and 1997 Acquisition Centers generated $17.7
      million of this increase and $2.2 million of the increase was from the
      Same Centers.

            Other income increased to $4.5 million in 1998 from $3.2 million in
      1997. Approximately $0.6 million of the increase related to the 1998 and
      1997 Acquisition Centers, $0.7 million of the increase was attributable to
      the Same Centers and the Redevelopment Centers.

      EXPENSES

            Shopping center expenses increased to $90.0 million in 1998 compared
      to $70.9 million in 1997. Approximately $17.3 million of the increase
      resulted from the 1998 and 1997 Acquisition Centers. The other Centers had
      a net increase of $1.8 million in shopping center expenses resulting
      primarily from increased property taxes and recoverable expenses.

            General and administrative expenses increased to $4.4 million in
      1998 from $2.8 million in 1997 primarily due to the accounting change
      required by EITF 97-11, "Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to Real
      Estate Property Acquisitions," which requires the expensing of internal
      acquisition costs. Previously in accordance with GAAP, certain internal
      acquisition costs were capitalized. The increase is also attributable to
      higher executive and director compensation expense.


      INTEREST EXPENSE

            Interest expense increased to $91.4 million in 1998 from $66.4
      million in 1997. This increase of $25.0 million is primarily attributable
      to the acquisition activity in 1997 and 1998, which was partially funded
      with secured debt and borrowings under the Company's line of credit. In
      addition, in June and July of 1997, the Company issued $161.4 million of
      convertible debentures, which contributed to $5.7 million of this
      increase.

      DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

            Depreciation and amortization increased to $53.1 million from $41.5
      million in 1997. This increase relates primarily to the 1997 and 1998
      Acquisition Centers.


      MINORITY INTEREST

            The minority interest represents the 28.4% weighted average interest
      of the Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during
      1998. This compares to 31.8% not owned by the Company during 1997.

      1998 acquisition of the ERE/Yarmouth portfolio. Also, in 1997, there was a
      write-down and loss of $10.5 million on the sale of North Valley Plaza.

            Cash flow from operations was $85.2 million in 1998 compared to
      $78.4 million in 1997. The increase resulted from the factors discussed
      above, primarily the impact of the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Centers.

      INVESTING ACTIVITIES

            Cash flow used in investing activities was $761.1 million in 1998
      compared to $215.0 million in 1997. The change resulted primarily from the
      higher volume of acquisition activity completed in 1998 compared to 1997.

      FINANCING ACTIVITIES

            Cash flow from financing activities was $676.0 million in 1998
      compared to $146.0 million in 1997. The increase resulted from the
      offerings of 7,920,181 shares of common stock, 3,627,131 shares of Series
      A Preferred Stock and 5,487,471 shares of Series B Preferred Stock
      completed in 1998. No equity was raised in 1997.

      EBITDA AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

            Primarily because of the factors mentioned above, EBITDA increased
      28% to $189.5 million in 1998 from $147.6 million in 1997 and Funds from
      Operations - Diluted increased 44% to $120.5 million from $83.4 million in
      1997.

      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

            The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements
      through cash generated from operations and working capital reserves. The
      Company anticipates that revenues will continue to provide necessary funds
      for its operating expenses and debt service requirements, and to pay
      dividends to stockholders in accordance with REIT requirements. The
      Company anticipates that cash generated from operations, together with
      cash on hand, will be adequate to fund capital expenditures which will not
      be reimbursed by tenants, other than non-recurring capital expenditures.
      Capital for major expenditures or major redevelopments has been, and is
      expected to continue to be, obtained from equity or debt financings which
      include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction
      loans. However, many factors impact the Company's ability to access
      capital, such as its overall debt to market capitalization level, interest
      rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. The
      Company currently is undertaking a $90 million redevelopment of Pacific
      View. See "Item 2. Properties." The Company has a bank construction loan
      agreement to fund $89.2 million of these construction costs.

            The Company believes that it will have access to the capital
      necessary to expand its business in accordance with its strategies for
      growth and maximizing Funds from Operations. The Company presently intends
      to obtain additional capital necessary to expand its business through a
      combination of additional public and private equity offerings, debt
      financings and/or joint ventures. During 1998 and 1999, the Company
      acquired two portfolios through joint ventures. The Company believes such
      joint venture arrangements provide an attractive alternative to other
      forms of financing. See "Acquisitions and Joint Venture Developments."

            The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31,
      1999 was $2.2 billion (including its pro rata share of joint venture
      debt). This equated to a debt to Total Market Capitalization (defined as
      total debt of the Company, including its pro rata share of joint venture
      debt, plus aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock,
      assuming full conversion of OP Units and preferred stock into common
      stock) ratio of approximately 66% at December 31, 1999. The Company's debt
      consists primarily of fixed-rate conventional mortgages payable secured by
      individual properties. See "Properties-Mortgage Debt" for a description of
      the Company's outstanding mortgage indebtedness.

            The Company has filed a shelf registration statement, effective
      December 8, 1997, to sell securities. The shelf registration is for a
      total of $500 million of common stock, common stock warrants or common
      stock rights. During 1998, the Company sold a total of 7,920,181 shares of
      common stock under this shelf registration. The aggregate offering price
      of these transactions was approximately $212.9 million, leaving
      approximately $287.1 million available under the shelf registration
      statement.

            The Company has an unsecured line of credit for up to $150.0
      million. There was $57.4 million of borrowings outstanding at December 31,
      1999.

            At December 31, 1999, the Company had cash and cash equivalents
      available of $40.5 million.

      YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE

      THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BELOW CONTAINS YEAR 2000 STATEMENTS AND IS A
YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO PUB. L. NO. 105-271.

      YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE PROGRAM

      Approximately two years ago, the Company initiated a Year 2000
compliance program which consisted of the following phases: (1)
identification of Year 2000 issues; (2) assessment of Year 2000 compliance of
systems; (3) remediation or replacement of non-compliant systems; (4) testing
of critical systems to verify compliance; and (5) contingency planning, as
appropriate. This program included a review of both information technology
("IT") and non-IT systems of the Company's offices and the Centers in which
the Company has an ownership interest and manages. In addition, material
tenants, anchors and vendors of the Centers were surveyed for Year 2000
compliance and contingency plans were prepared for each Center.

      YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE PROGRAM RESULTS

      Two of the key dates of the Company's Year 2000 program were January 1,
2000 and February 29, 2000. The Company encountered no Year 2000 compliance
issues with any operating system, material tenant, anchor and/or vendor on
either date because the Company was able to successfully identify and address
the potential Year 2000 issues in advance.

      COSTS

      The Company was able to minimize costs by using its own personnel to
administer the Year 2000 program. No outside consultants or third parties
were hired except for testing purposes. The preliminary final costs for the
Company's Year 2000 program were approximately $120,000 and consisted of the
following:

      (a)   IT SYSTEMS: One IT hardware system needed a Year 2000 upgrade at a
            cost of $13,100.

      (b)   NON-IT SYSTEMS: Certain critical systems, 14 energy management
            systems, five telephone systems, two fire alarm systems, one
            security alarm system, one CCTV system, one HVAC system and one
            elevator intercom system required Year 2000 upgrades. Replacement
            and/or remediation of all non-IT systems at the Centers and offices
            cost the Company approximately $47,194.

      (c)   ELECTRICAL INSPECTION: The electrical infrastructure of each Center
            was inspected to ensure Year 2000 compliance at an estimated cost of
            approximately $13,230.

      (d)   TESTING OF CRITICAL SYSTEM: All date-sensitive critical operating
            systems at each Center and office were tested to ensure Year 2000
            compliance. In most cases outside vendors tested the system and
            charged a fee. The Company's total testing costs were approximately
            $9,125.

      (e)   SECURITY CONTINGENCY PLANS: Each Center implemented security
            contingency plans. The aggregate costs of approximately $37,500
            included the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and
            obtaining necessary equipment and back-up supplies ranging from
            emergency generators to flashlights.

      (f)   PERSONNEL: The Company did not separately record the internal costs
            incurred for its Year 2000 compliance program. Such costs are
            primarily the related payroll costs for its personnel who were part
            of the Year 2000 program.

                                         32

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

      The Company believes that the most significant measure of its
performance is FFO. FFO is defined by The National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") to be: Net income (loss) (computed in accordance
with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales or
write-down of assets, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding
depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial
instrument costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities.
Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis. FFO
does not represent cash flow from operations, as defined by GAAP, and is not
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The
following reconciles net income available to common stockholders to FFO:

      FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, CONTINUED:

      (1)   Calculated based upon basic net income as adjusted to reach basic
            FFO. Weighted average number of shares includes the weighted average
            shares of common stock outstanding for 1999 assuming the conversion
            of all outstanding OP Units.

      (2)   The computation of FFO - diluted and diluted average number of
            shares outstanding includes the effect of outstanding common stock
            options and restricted stock using the treasury method. Convertible
            debentures for the twelve month period ending December 31, 1998 were
            anti-dilutive and were not included in the FFO calculation. The
            debentures are dilutive at December 31, 1999 and are included in the
            FFO calculation. On February 25, 1998, the Company sold $100 million
            of its Series A Preferred Stock. On June 17, 1998, the Company sold
            $150 million of its Series B Preferred Stock. The preferred stock
            can be converted on a one-for-one basis for common stock. The
            preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of 1999 net
            income as they are dilutive to that calculation. The preferred
            shares are anti-dilutive to net income for 1998. The preferred
            shares are assumed converted for purposes of FFO-diluted per share
            as they are dilutive to that calculation.

      Included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting
      practice of straight lining of rents. The amount of straight lining of
      rents that impacted minimum rents was $2,628,000 for 1999, $3,814,000 for
      1998 and $3,599,000 for 1997.

INFLATION

         In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact
on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases
at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term.
These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in
the Consumer Price Index. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of
less than ten years, which enables the Company to replace existing leases
with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are
below the then existing market rate. Additionally, most of the leases require
the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. This reduces
the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting
from inflation.

SEASONALITY

         The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in
the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and
retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping
malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer)
rents during the holiday season. As a result of the above, plus the
accounting change discussed below for percentage rent, earnings are generally
higher in the fourth quarter of each year.

NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED

         In May 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"),
through the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF"), modified the timing of
recognition of revenue for percentage rent received from tenants in EITF
98-9, "Accounting for Contingent Rent in Interim Financial Periods" ("EITF
98-9"). The Company applied this accounting change as of April 1, 1998. The
accounting change had the effect of deferring $3,241,000, including the pro
rata share of joint ventures, of percentage rent from the second and third
quarters of 1998 to the quarter ended December 31, 1998. During the fourth
quarter of 1998, the FASB reversed EITF 98-9. Accordingly, the Company
resumed accounting for percentage rent on the accrual basis for 1999. In
December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Committee issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," ("SAB 101")
which will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 1999. This
bulletin again modified the timing of revenue recognition for percentage rent
received from tenants and adopted the method mandated by EITF 98-9. The
Company expects this change to defer recognition of a significant amount of
percentage rent for the first three calendar quarters into the fourth
quarter. The Company applied this accounting change as of January 1, 2000.
Estimates of the effects of this change have not yet been determined.

         In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard ("SFAS") 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," ("SFAS 133") which requires companies to record derivatives on
the balance sheet, measured at fair value. Changes in the fair values of
those derivatives will be accounted for depending on the use of the
derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The key criterion
for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly
effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows. In
June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities," which delays the implementation of SFAS 133 from
January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2001. The Company has not yet determined when
it will implement SFAS 133 nor has it completed the analysis required
to determine the impact on its financial statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

            The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.
      The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by
      (1) maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to
      total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable
      level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term variable
      rate debt through the use of interest rate caps with appropriately
      matching maturities, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to
      fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of
      favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity.

            The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 1999
      concerning the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal
      cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and
      estimated fair value ("FV"):

      $57.4 million of variable debt maturing in 2001 represents the outstanding
      borrowings under the Company's credit facility. The credit facility
      matures in February 2001.

      In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its variable
      rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease
      future earnings and cash flows by approximately $3.4 million per year
      based on $340.8 million outstanding at December 31, 1999.

      The fair value of the Company's long term debt is estimated based on
      discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects
      the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Macerich Company:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of The Macerich Company ("the Company") as listed in Items 14(a)(1)
and (4) of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits. We did not audit the financial
statements of SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. (the "Partnership") the
investment in which is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements using the equity method of accounting. The investment in the
Partnership represents approximately 10% of 1999 and 1998 consolidated total
assets of the Company, and the equity in its net income represents
approximately 6% and 33% of the Company's 1999 and 1998 consolidated net
income, respectively. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose
report has been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the
amounts included for the Partnership, is based solely on the report of the
other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of The Macerich Company as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information required to be included therein.

                              THE MACERICH COMPANY
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

1.   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

          The Macerich Company (the "Company") commenced operations effective
     with the completion of its initial public offering (the "IPO") on March 16,
     1994. The Company is the sole general partner of and holds an 80% ownership
     interest in The Macerich Partnership, L. P. (the "Operating Partnership").
     The interests in the Operating Partnership are known as OP Units. OP Units
     not held by the Company are redeemable, subject to certain restrictions, on
     a one-for-one basis, for the Company's common stock or cash at the
     Company's option.

          The Company was organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust
     ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The 20%
     limited partnership interest of the Operating Partnership not owned by the
     Company is reflected in these financial statements as minority interest.

          The property management, leasing and redevelopment of the Company's
     portfolio is provided by the Macerich Management Company, Macerich Property
     Management Company and Macerich Manhattan Management Company, all
     California corporations (together referred to hereafter as the "Management
     Companies"). The non-voting preferred stock of the Macerich Management
     Company and Macerich Property Management Company is owned by the Operating
     Partnership, which provides the Operating Partnership the right to receive
     95% of the distributable cash flow from the Management Companies. Macerich
     Manhattan Management Company is a 100% subsidiary of Macerich Management
     Company.

     BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

          The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the
     accounts of the Company and the Operating Partnership. The properties in
     which the Operating Partnership does not have a controlling interest in,
     and the Management Companies, have been accounted for under the equity
     method of accounting. These entities are reflected on the Company's
     consolidated financial statements as "Investments in joint ventures and the
     Management Companies."

          All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
     eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:

          The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
     maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents, for
     which cost approximates market. Included in cash is restricted cash of
     $1,418 at December 31, 1999 and $5,954 at December 31, 1998.

     TENANT RECEIVABLES:

          Included in tenant receivables are allowances for doubtful accounts of
     $1,752 and $1,707 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     REVENUES:

          Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over
     the terms of the related lease. The difference between the amount of rent
     due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as
     the "straight lining of rent adjustment." Rental income was increased by
     $2,628 in 1999, $3,814 in 1998 and $3,599 in 1997 due to the straight
     lining of rent adjustment. Percentage rents are recognized on an accrual
     basis. Recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other
     shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period
     the applicable costs are incurred.

          The Management Companies provide property management, leasing,
     corporate, redevelopment and acquisition services to affiliated and
     non-affiliated shopping centers. In consideration for these services, the
     Management Companies receive monthly management fees generally ranging from
     1.5% to 5% of the gross monthly rental revenue of the properties managed.

                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)


2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:

     PROPERTY:

          Costs related to the redevelopment, construction and improvement of
     properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until
     construction is substantially complete.

          Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as
     incurred. Realized gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or
     retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.


          Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line
     method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:


          Buildings and improvements                              5-40 years
          Tenant improvements                  initial term of related lease
          Equipment and furnishings                               5- 7 years

          The Company assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value
     of its long-lived assets by considering factors such as expected future
     operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand,
     competition and other economic factors. Such factors include the tenants'
     ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases.
     The Company may recognize an impairment loss if the income stream is not
     sufficient to cover its investment. Such a loss would be determined between
     the carrying value and the fair value of a center. Management believes no
     such impairment has occurred in its net property carrying values at
     December 31, 1999 and 1998.

     DEFERRED CHARGES:

          Costs relating to financing of shopping center properties and
     obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of
     the agreement. The straight-line method is used to amortize all costs
     except financing, for which the effective interest method is used. The
     range of the terms of the agreements are as follows:

          Deferred lease costs                    1 - 15 years
          Deferred financing costs                1 - 15 years

          In March 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"),
     through its Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF"), concluded based on EITF
     97-11, "Accounting for Internal Costs Relating to Real Estate Property
     Acquisitions," that all internal costs to source, analyze and close
     acquisitions should be expensed as incurred. The Company has historically
     capitalized these costs, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
     principles ("GAAP"). The Company has adopted the FASB's interpretation
     effective March 19, 1998.


     DEFERRED ACQUISITION LIABILITY:

          As part of the Company's total consideration to the seller of Capitola
     Mall, the Company will issue $5,000 of OP Units five years after the
     acquisition date, which was December 21, 1995. The number of OP Units will
     be determined based on the Company's common stock price at that time.

     INCOME TAXES:

          The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal
     Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. A REIT is generally not subject to income
     taxation on that portion of its income that qualifies as REIT taxable
     income as long as it distributes at least 95 percent of its taxable income
     to its stockholders and complies with other requirements. Accordingly, no
     provision has been made for income taxes in the consolidated financial
     statements.

                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:

     INCOME TAXES - CONTINUED:

          On a tax basis, the distributions of $1.965 paid during 1999
     represented $1.30 of ordinary income and $0.665 of capital gain. The
     distributions of $1.865 per share during 1998 represented $1.12 of ordinary
     income and $0.745 of return of capital. During 1997, the distributions were
     $1.78 per share of which $0.96 was ordinary income and $0.82 was return of
     capital.

          Each partner is taxed individually on its share of partnership income
     or loss, and accordingly, no provision for federal and state income tax is
     provided for the Operating Partnership in the consolidated financial
     statements.

     RECLASSIFICATIONS:

          Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1997 and 1998
     consolidated financial statements to conform to the 1999 financial
     statement presentation.

     ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

          In May 1998, the FASB, through the EITF, modified the timing of
     recognition of revenue for percentage rent received from tenants in EITF
     98-9, "Accounting for Contingent Rent in Interim Financial Periods" ("EITF
     98-9"). The Company applied this accounting change as of April 1, 1998. The
     accounting change had the effect of deferring $3,241,000, including the
     prorata share of joint ventures, of percentage rent from the second and
     third quarters of 1998 to the quarter ended December 31, 1998. During the
     fourth quarter of 1998, the FASB reversed EITF 98-9. Accordingly, the
     Company resumed accounting for percentage rent on the accrual basis for
     1999. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Committee issued Staff
     Accounting Bulletin 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,"
     ("SAB 101") which will be effective for periods beginning after December
     15, 1999. This bulletin again modified the timing of revenue recognition
     for percentage rent received from tenants and adopted the method mandated
     by EITF 98-9. The Company expects this change to defer recognition of a
     significant amount of percentage rent for the first three calendar quarters
     into the fourth quarter. The Company applied this accounting change as of
     January 1, 2000. Estimates of the effects of this change have not yet been
     determined.

          In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
     Standard ("SFAS") 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
     Activities," ("SFAS 133") which requires companies to record derivatives on
     the balance sheet, measured at fair value. Changes in the fair values of
     those derivatives will be accounted for depending on the use of the
     derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The key criterion
     for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly
     effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows. In
     June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
     and Hedging Activities," which delays the implementation of SFAS 133 from
     January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2001. The Company has not yet determined when
     it will implement SFAS 133 nor has it completed the analysis required to
     determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements.


     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

          To meet the reporting requirement of SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures about
     Fair Value of Financial Instruments," the Company calculates the fair value
     of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the
     notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different
     than the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value
     reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is
     made. The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company
     using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
     However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to
     develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
     herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could
     realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market
     assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on
     the estimated fair value amounts.

                              THE MACERICH COMPANY
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:

     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CONTINUED:

          Interest rate cap agreements are purchased by the Company from third
     parties to hedge the risk of interest rate increases on some of the
     Company's variable rate debt. The cost of these cap agreements is amortized
     over the life of the cap agreement on a straight line basis. Payments
     received as a result of the cap agreements are recorded as a reduction of
     interest expense. The unamortized costs of the cap agreements are included
     in deferred charges. The fair value of these caps will vary with
     fluctuations in interest rates. The Company is exposed to credit loss in
     the event of nonperformance by these counter parties to the financial
     instruments; however, management does not anticipate nonperformance by the
     counter parties.

          The Company periodically enters into treasury lock agreements in order
     to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on anticipated
     financings. Under these agreements, the Company pays or receives an amount
     equal to the difference between the treasury lock rate and the market rate
     on the date of settlement, based on the notional amount of the hedge. The
     realized gain or loss on the contracts is recorded on the balance sheet, in
     other assets, and amortized as interest expense over the period of the
     hedged loans.

     EARNINGS PER SHARE ("EPS"):

          During 1998, the Company implemented SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per
     share." The computation of basic earnings per share is based on net income
     and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the years
     ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997. The computation of diluted earnings
     per share includes the effect of outstanding restricted stock and common
     stock options calculated using the Treasury stock method. The OP Units not
     held by the Company have been included in the diluted EPS calculation since
     they are redeemable on a one-for-one basis. The following table reconciles
     the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation:

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED:

          CONCENTRATION OF RISK:

          The Company maintains its cash accounts in a number of commercial
     banks. Accounts at these banks are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
     Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $100. At various times during the
     year, the Company had deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit.

          Lakewood Mall generated 10.5% of total shopping center revenues in
     1997. No Center generated more than 10% of shopping center revenues during
     1999 and 1998.

          The Centers derived approximately 90.2%, 89.9% and 89.5% of their
     total rents for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997,
     respectively, from Mall and Freestanding Stores. The Limited represented
     5.2% and 6.1% of total minimum rents in place as of December 31, 1999
     and 1998, respectively, and no other retailer represented more than
     3.2% and 4.5% of total minimum rents as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
     respectively.

     MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES:

          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
     requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
     reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
     assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
     reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
     Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE:

          Approximately two years ago, the Company initiated a Year 2000
     compliance program which consisted of the following phases: (1)
     identification of Year 2000 issues; (2) assessment of Year 2000 compliance
     of systems; (3) remediation or replacement of non-compliant systems; (4)
     testing of critical systems to verify compliance; and (5) contingency
     planning, as appropriate. This program included a review of both
     information technology ("IT") and non-IT systems of the Company's offices
     and the Centers in which the Company has an ownership interest and manages.
     In addition, material tenants, anchors and vendors of the Centers were
     surveyed for Year 2000 compliance and contingency plans were prepared for
     each Center.

          Two of the key dates of the Company's Year 2000 program were January
     1, 2000 and February 29, 2000. The Company encountered no Year 2000
     compliance issues, with any operating system, material tenant, anchor
     and/or vendor on either date. As of December 31, 1999, the Company did not
     expend significant amounts for the Year 2000 program.

3.   INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND THE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES:

          The following are the Company's investments in various real estate
     joint ventures which own regional retail and community shopping centers.

3.   INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND THE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, CONTINUED:

          The Operating Partnership also owns the non-voting preferred stock of
     the Macerich Management Company and Macerich Property Management Company
     and is entitled to receive 95% of the distributable cash flow of these two
     entities. Macerich Manhattan Management Company is a 100% subsidiary of
     Macerich Management Company. The Company accounts for the Management
     Companies and joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.

          On February 27, 1998, the Company, through SDG Macerich Properties,
     L.P., a 50/50 joint venture with an affiliate of Simon Property Group,
     Inc., acquired a portfolio of twelve regional malls. The properties in the
     portfolio comprise 10.7 million square feet and are located in eight
     states. The total purchase price was $974,500, which included $485,000 of
     assumed debt, at market value. The Company's share of the cash component
     of the purchase price was funded by issuing $100,000 of Series A cumulative
     convertible redeemable preferred stock ("Series A Preferred Stock"),
     $80,000 of common stock and borrowing the balance from the Company's line
     of credit. Each of the joint venture partners have assumed leasing and
     management responsibilities for six of the regional malls.

          On February 18, 1999, the Company, through a 51/49 joint venture with
     Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board ("Ontario Teachers") closed on the
     first phase of a two phase acquisition of a portfolio of properties. The
     phase one closing included the acquisition of three regional malls, the
     retail component of a mixed-use development, five contiguous properties and
     two non-contiguous community shopping centers comprising approximately 3.6
     million square feet for a total purchase price of approximately $427,000.
     The purchase price was funded with a $120,000 loan placed concurrently with
     the closing, $140,400 of debt from an affiliate of the seller, and $39,400
     of assumed debt. The balance of the purchase price was paid in cash. The
     Company's share of the cash component was funded with the proceeds from two
     refinancings of centers and borrowings under the Company's line of credit.
     On July 12, 1999, the Company closed on the second phase of the
     acquisition. The second phase consisted of the acquisition of the office
     component of the mixed-use development for a purchase price of
     approximately $111,000. The purchase price was funded with a $76,700 loan
     placed concurrently with the closing and the balance was paid in cash. The
     Company's share of the cash component was funded from borrowings under the
     Company's line of credit.

          On June 2, 1999, Macerich Cerritos, LLC ("Cerritos"), a wholly-owned
     subsidiary of Macerich Management Company, acquired Los Cerritos Center in
     Cerritos, California. The total purchase price was $188,000, which was
     funded with $120,000 of debt placed concurrently with the closing and a
     $70,800 loan from the Company. The Company funded this loan from borrowings
     under a $60,000 bank loan agreement and the balance from the Company's line
     of credit.

          On October 26, 1999, 49% of the membership interests of Macerich
     Stonewood, LLC ("Stonewood"), Cerritos and Macerich Lakewood, LLC
     ("Lakewood"), were sold to Ontario Teachers' and concurrently Ontario
     Teachers' and the Company contributed their 99% collective membership
     interests in Stonewood and Cerritos and 100% of their collective
     membership interests in Lakewood to Pacific Premier Retail Trust
     ("PPRT"), a real estate investment trust, owned approximately 51% by the
     Company and 49% by Ontario Teachers. Lakewood, Stonewood, and Cerritos
     own Lakewood Mall, Stonewood Mall and Los Cerritos Center, respectively.
     The total value of the transaction was approximately $535,000. The
     properties were contributed to PPRT subject to existing debt of
     $322,000. The net cash proceeds to the Company were approximately
     $104,000 which were used for reduction of debt and for general corporate
     purposes.

          The results of these joint ventures are included for the period
     subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition.

          On October 27, 1999, Albany Plaza, a 145,462 square foot community
     center, which was owned 51% by the Macerich Management Company, was sold.

          On November 12, 1999, Eastland Plaza, a 65,313 square foot community
     center, which was 51% owned by the Macerich Management Company, was sold.

         (a) This represents the monthly payment of principal and interest.

         (b)  On April 30, 1999, the old loan of $25,000 was paid in full and
              was refinanced with a new loan of $29,000, with a fixed interest
              rate of 8.18%, maturing May 1, 2009.

         (c)  This amount represents the monthly payment of principal and
              interest. In addition, contingent interest, as defined in the loan
              agreement, may be due to the extent that 35% of the amount by
              which the property's gross receipts (as defined in the loan
              agreement) exceeds a base amount specified therein. Contingent
              interest expense recognized by the Company was $385 for the year
              ended December 31, 1999 and $387 for the year ended December 31,
              1998.

         (d)  The old loan bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.0%. On October 8, 1999,
              the loan was paid in full and was refinanced with a new loan of
              $72,000 at a fixed rate of 7.75%, maturing November 1, 2009.

         (e)  This note was issued at a discount. The discount is being
              amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest
              method. At December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998 the unamortized
              discount was $364 and $397, respectively.

                (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

6.        MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLE, CONTINUED:

         (f)  This loan is cross collateralized by Green Tree Mall, Crossroads
              Mall-Oklahoma and the Centre at Salisbury.

         (g)  On August 15, 1995, the Company issued $127,000 of collateralized
              fixed rate notes (the "Notes"). The Notes bear interest at an
              average fixed rate of 7.20% and mature in July 2005. The Notes
              require the Company to deposit all cash flow from the property
              operations with a trustee to meet its obligations under the Notes.
              Cash in excess of the required amount, as defined, is released.
              Included in cash and cash equivalents is $750 of restricted cash
              deposited with the trustee at December 31, 1999 and at 1998. All
              of the Notes were assumed by the Pacific Premier Retail Trust
              joint venture on October 26, 1999.

         (h)  At December 31, 1998, a $65,100 loan was outstanding which bore
              interest at LIBOR plus 0.45%. There was an interest rate
              protection agreement in place on the first $10,200 of this debt
              with a LIBOR ceiling of 5.88% through maturity with the remaining
              principal having an interest rate cap with a LIBOR ceiling of
              7.07% through 1997 and 7.7% thereafter. The $65,100 loan was paid
              in full on February 4, 1999 and refinanced with a new loan of
              $100,000, with interest at 6.88%, maturing in 2009. The Company
              incurred a loss on early extinguishment of the old debt in 1999 of
              $163.

         (i)  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%. In addition, the
              Company can increase the loan amount up to $90,000. As of January
              6, 2000, an additional $5,000 was advanced for total borrowings
              outstanding of $85,000.

         (j)  The old note of $28,795 was assumed at acquisition. At the time of
              acquisition in June 1998, this debt was recorded at fair value and
              the premium was amortized as interest expense over the life of the
              loan using the effective interest method. The monthly debt service
              payment was $348 per month and was calculated based on a 12.5%
              interest rate. At December 31, 1998, the unamortized premium was
              $6,165. On February 17, 1999, the loan was paid in full and was
              refinanced with a new loan of $65,000, with interest at 8.22%,
              maturing in 2009. The Company incurred a loss on early
              extinguishment of the old debt in 1999 of $810.

         (k)  Included in cash and cash equivalents is $0 and $3,030 at December
              31, 1999 and 1998 respectively, of cash restricted under the terms
              of this loan agreement.

         (l) Reflects the Company's pro rata share of debt.

         (m)  In connection with the acquisition of this Center, the joint
              venture assumed $39,425 of debt. At acquisition, this debt was
              recorded at fair value of $41,475 which included an unamortized
              premium of $2,050. This premium is being amortized as interest
              expense over the life of the loan using the effective interest
              method. The joint venture's monthly debt service is $349 and is
              calculated based on an 8.60% interest rate. At December 31, 1999,
              the joint venture's unamortized premium was $1,365.

         (n)  Concurrent with the acquisition, the joint venture placed $76,700
              of debt and obtained a construction loan for an additional
              $16,000. Principal is drawn on the construction loan as costs are
              incurred. As of December 31, 1999, $6,745 of principal had been
              drawn under the construction loan by the joint venture.

         (o)  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%. At December 31, 1999
              the total interest rate was 8.23%.

6.  MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLE, CONTINUED:

         (p)  In connection with the acquisition of these Centers, the joint
              venture assumed $485,000 of mortgage notes payable which are
              secured by the properties. At acquisition, this debt reflected a
              fair value of $322,700, which included an unamortized premium of
              $22,700. This premium is being amortized as interest expense over
              the life of the loan using the effective interest method. At
              December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, the unamortized balance
              of the debt premium was $18,565 and 20,868, respectively. This
              debt is due in May 2006 and requires monthly payments of $1,852.
              $185,000 of this debt is due in May 2003 and requires monthly
              interest payments at a variable weighted average rate (based on
              LIBOR) of 6.96% and 5.86% at December 31, 1999 and December 31,
              1998, respectively. This variable rate debt is covered by an
              interest rate cap agreement which effectively prevents the
              interest rate from exceeding 11.53%.

         (q)  On January 4, 1999, the joint venture replaced the old debt with a
              new loan of $40,000. The loan is at an interest rate of 6.52% and
              matures January 2009. The debt is interest only until January 2001
              at which time monthly payments of principal and interest will be
              due of $299.

     Certain mortgage loan agreements contain a prepayment penalty provision for
     the early extinguishment of the debt.

     Total interest expense capitalized during 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $6,670,
     $3,199 and $2,224, respectively.

      The fair value of mortgage notes payable for wholly-owned Centers at
     December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998 is estimated to be approximately
     $1,179,469 and $1,271,853, respectively, based on current interest rates
     for comparable loans.

     The above debt matures as follows:

                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

7.       BANK AND OTHER NOTES PAYABLE:

         The Company has a credit facility of $150,000 with a maturity of
     February 2001, currently bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.15%. The interest
     rate on such credit facility fluctuates between 0.95% and 1.15% over LIBOR.
     As of December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, $57,400 and $137,000 of
     borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit at interest rates of
     7.65% and 6.79%, respectively.

         Additionally, the Company issued $776 in letters of credit guaranteeing
     performance by the Company of certain obligations. The Company does not
     believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the
     Company.

         During January 1999, the Company entered into a bank construction loan
     agreement to fund $89,200 of costs related to the redevelopment of Pacific
     View. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% and matures in February
     2001. Principal is drawn as construction costs are incurred. As of December
     31, 1999, $72,671 of principal has been drawn under the loan.

         In addition, the Company had a note payable of $30,600 due in February
     2000 payable to the seller of the acquired portfolio. The note bore
     interest at 6.5%. The entire $30,600 loan was paid off on February 18,
     2000.

8.       CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES:

         During 1997, the Company issued and sold $161,400 of convertible
     subordinated debentures (the "Debentures") due 2002. The Debentures, which
     were sold at par, bear interest at 7.25% annually (payable semi-annually)
     and are convertible at any time, on or after 60 days, from the date of
     issue at a conversion price of $31.125 per share. The Debentures mature on
     December 15, 2002 and are callable by the Company after June 15, 2002 at
     par plus accrued interest.

9.       RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

         The Company engaged the Management Companies to manage the operations
     of its properties and certain unconsolidated joint ventures. During 1999,
     1998 and 1997, management fees of $3,247, $2,817 and $2,219, respectively,
     were paid to the Management Companies by the Company. During 1999, 1998 and
     1997, management fees of $4,982, $2,375, and $633, respectively, were paid
     to the Management Companies by the joint ventures.

         Certain mortgage notes are held by one of the Company's joint venture
     partners. Interest expense in connection with these notes was $10,171,
     $10,224 and $10,287 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
     respectively. Included in accounts payables and accrued expense is interest
     payable to these partners of $513 and $512 at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
     respectively.

         In 1997 and 1999, certain executive officers, received loans from the
     Company totaling $6,500. These loans are full recourse to the executives.
     $6,000 of the loans were issued under the terms of the employee stock
     incentive plan, bear interest at 7%, are due in 2007 and 2009 and are
     secured by Company common stock owned by the executives. The remaining loan
     is non interest bearing and is forgiven ratably over a five year term.
     These loans receivable are included in other assets at December 31, 1999
     and 1998.

         Certain Company officers and affiliates have guaranteed mortgages of
     $21,750 at one of the Company's joint venture properties and $2,000 at
     Greeley Mall.

11.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

         The Company has certain properties subject to noncancellable operating
     ground leases. The leases expire at various times through 2070, subject in
     some cases to options to extend the terms of the lease. Certain leases
     provide for contingent rent payments based on a percentage of base rental
     income, as defined. Ground rent expenses were $890 (including contingent
     rent of $0) in 1999, $1,125 (including contingent rent of $0) in 1998 and
     $817 (including contingent rents of $0) in 1997.

         Perchloroethylene ("PCE") has been detected in soil and groundwater in
the vicinity of a dry cleaning establishment at North Valley Plaza, formerly
owned by a joint venture of which the Company was a 50% member. The property was
sold on December 18, 1997. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control
("DTSC") advised the Company in 1995 that very low levels of Dichloroethylene
("1,2 DCE"), a degradation byproduct of PCE, had been detected in a municipal
water well located 1/4 mile west of the dry cleaners, and that the dry cleaning
facility may have contributed to the introduction of 1,2 DCE into the water
well. According to DTSC, the maximum contaminant level ("MCL") for 1,2 DCE which
is permitted in drinking water is 6 parts per billion ("ppb"). The 1,2 DCE was
detected in the water well at a concentration of 1.2 ppb, which is below the
MCL. The Company has retained an environmental consultant and has initiated
extensive testing of the site. Remediation began in October 1997. The joint
venture agreed (between itself and the buyer) that it would be responsible for
continuing to pursue the investigation and remediation of impacted soil and
groundwater resulting from releases of PCE from the former dry cleaner. $149 and
$153 have already been incurred by the joint venture for remediation and
professional and legal fees for the years ending December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. An additional $259 remains reserved by the joint venture as of
December 31, 1999. The joint venture has been sharing costs on a 50/50 basis
with a former owner of the property and intends to look to additional
responsible parties for recovery.

11.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - CONTINUED:

         The Company acquired Fresno Fashion Fair in December 1996. Asbestos has
     been detected in structural fireproofing throughout much of the Center.
     Testing data conducted by professional environmental consulting firms
     indicates that the fireproofing is largely inaccessible to building
     occupants and is well adhered to the structural members. Additionally,
     airborne concentrations of asbestos were well within OSHA's permissible
     exposure limit (PEL) of .1 fcc. The accounting for this acquisition
     includes a reserve of $3,300 to cover future removal of this asbestos, as
     necessary. The Company incurred $91 and $255 in remediation costs for the
     years ending December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

12.      PROFIT SHARING PLAN:

         The Management Companies and the Company have a retirement profit
     sharing plan that was established in 1984 covering substantially all of
     their eligible employees. The plan is qualified in accordance with section
     401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective January 1, 1995, this plan
     was modified to include a 401(k) plan whereby employees can elect to defer
     compensation subject to Internal Revenue Service withholding rules. This
     plan was further amended effective February 1, 1999, to add the Macerich
     Company Common Stock Fund as a new investment alternative under the plan.
     150,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the plan.
     Contributions by the Management Companies are made at the discretion of the
     Board of Directors and are based upon a specified percentage of employee
     compensation. The Management Companies and the Company contributed $615,
     $509 and $400 to the plan during the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998
     and 1997, respectively.

13.      STOCK OPTION PLAN:

         The Company has established an employee stock incentive plan under
     which stock options or restricted stock may be awarded for the purpose of
     attracting and retaining executive officers, directors and key employees.
     The Company has issued options to employees and directors to purchase
     shares of the Company under the stock incentive plan. The term of these
     options is ten years from the grant date. These options generally vest 33
     1/3% per year over three years and were issued and are exercisable at the
     market value of the common stock at the grant date.

         In addition, the Company has established a plan for non employee
     directors. The non employee director options have a term of ten years from
     the grant date, vest six months after grant and are issued at the market
     value of the common stock on the grant date. The plan reserved 50,000
     shares of which 42,500 shares were granted as of December 31, 1999.

         390,815 shares of restricted stock also have been issued under the
     employees stock incentive plan to executives. These awards are granted
     based on certain performance criteria for the Company. The restricted stock
     generally vests over 5 years and the compensation expense related to these
     grants is determined by the market value at the vesting date and is
     amortized over the vesting period on a straight line basis. As of December
     31, 1999 and 1998, 85,962 and 34,287 shares, respectively, of restricted
     stock had vested. A total of 176,600 shares at a weighted average price of
     $22.69 were issued in 1999, 83,018 shares at a weighted average price of
     $28.71 were issued in 1998 and 89,958 shares at a weighted average price of
     $27.46 were issued during 1997. Restricted stock is subject to restrictions
     determined by the Company's compensation committee. Restricted stock has
     the same dividend and voting rights as common stock and is considered
     issued when vested. Compensation expense for restricted stock was $2,037,
     $944 and $239 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

         Approximately 319,000 and 803,000 additional shares were reserved and
     were available for issuance under the stock incentive plan at December 31,
     1999 and 1998, respectively. The plan allows for, among other things,
     granting options or restricted stock at market value.

</TABLE>

   The weighted average exercise price for options granted in 1997 was $27.06,
   in 1998 was $27.38 and in 1999 was $23.35.

         The weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding
   at December 31, 1999 was 5 years and the weighted average remaining
   contractual life for options exercisable at December 31, 1999 was 5 years.

         The Company records options granted using Accounting Principles Board
   (APB) opinion Number 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and
   Related Interpretations." Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized
   on the date the options are granted. If the Company had recorded compensation
   expense using the methodology prescribed in SFAS 123, "Accounting for
   Stock-Based Compensation", the Company's net income would have been reduced
   by approximately $488 or $0.01 per share for the year ended December 31,
   1999 and $228 or $0.00 per share for the year ended December 31, 1998.

13.      STOCK OPTION PLAN, CONTINUED:

     The weighted average fair value of options granted during 1999 and 1998
were $0.98 and $2.01, respectively. The fair value of each option grant issued
in 1999 and 1998 is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: (a)
dividend yield of 10% in 1999 and 7.8% in 1998 , (b) expected volatility of the
Company's stock of 17.29% in 1999 and 17.26% in 1998, (c) a risk free interest
rate based on U.S. Zero Coupon Bonds with time of maturity approximately equal
to the options' expected time to exercise and (d) expected option lives of five
years for options granted in 1999 and 1998.

14.      DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS:

     The Company has established deferred compensation plans under which key
executives of the Company may elect to defer receiving a portion of their cash
compensation otherwise payable in one calendar year until a later year. The
Company may, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion,
credit a participant's account with an amount equal to a percentage of the
participant's deferral. The Company contributed $296 during 1999 and $295 during
1998 to two of these plans.

     In addition, certain executives have split dollar life insurance agreements
with the Company whereby the Company generally pays annual premiums on a life
insurance policy in an amount equal to the executives deferral under one of the
Company's deferred compensation plans.

15.      ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS:

     On February 18, 1999, the Company, through a 51/49 joint venture with
Ontario Teachers' closed on the first phase of a two phase acquisition of a
portfolio of properties. The phase one closing included the acquisition of three
regional malls, the retail component of a mixed-use development, five contiguous
properties and two non-contiguous community shopping centers comprising
approximately 3.6 million square feet for a total purchase price of
approximately $427,000. The purchase price was funded with a $120,000 loan
placed concurrently with the closing, $140,400 of debt from an affiliate of the
seller, and $39,400 of assumed debt. The balance of the purchase price was paid
in cash. The Company's share of the cash component was funded with the proceeds
from two refinancings of centers and borrowings under the Company's line of
credit. On July 12, 1999, the Company closed on the second phase of the
acquisition. The second phase consisted of the acquisition of the office
component of the mixed-use development for a purchase price of approximately
$111,000. The purchase price was funded with a $76,700 loan placed concurrently
with the closing and the balance was paid in cash. The Company's share of the
cash component was funded from borrowings under the Company's line of credit.

     On June 2, 1999, Cerritos, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Macerich Management

16.      PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED):

     The following unaudited pro forma financial information combines the
     consolidated results of operations of the Company for 1999 and 1998 as if
     the 1999 Acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 1998, after giving effect
     to certain adjustments, including depreciation, interest expense relating
     to debt incurred to finance the acquisitions and general and administrative
     expense to manage the properties. The pro forma information is based on
     assumptions management believes to be appropriate. The pro forma
     information is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results would
     have been had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the period
     indicated, nor does it purport to project the Company's financial position
     or results of operations at any future date or for any future period.

  perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

     retail component of a mixed-use development and five contiguous properties
     comprising approximately 3.4 million square feet for a total purchase price
     of approximately $415,000. The purchase price was funded with a $120,000
     loan placed concurrently with the closing, $109,800 of debt from an
     affiliate of the seller and $39,400 of assumed debt. The balance of the
     purchase price was paid in cash.

     The second phase consisted of the acquisition of the office component of
     the mixed-use development for a purchase price of approximately $111,000.
     The purchase price was funded with a $76,700 loan placed concurrently with
     the closing and the balance was paid in cash.

     On October 26, 1999, 99% of the membership interests of Los Cerritos Center
     and Stonewood Mall and 100% of the membership interests of Lakewood Mall
     were contributed to the Trust. The total value of the transaction was
     approximately $535,000. The properties were contributed to the Trust
     subject to existing debt of $322,000. The properties were recorded at
     approximately $453,100 to reflect the cost basis of the assets contributed
     to the Trust.

     The Trust was organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust
     ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Corp
     maintains a 51% ownership interest in the Trust, while Ontario Teachers'
     maintains a 49% ownership interest in the Trust.

     The properties as of December 31, 1999 and their locations are as follows:

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:

     The Trust considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity
     of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents, for which cost
     approximates market. Included in cash is restricted cash of $1,299 at
     December 31, 1999.

     TENANT RECEIVABLES:

     Included in tenant receivables are accrued overage rents of $2,835 and an
     allowance for doubtful accounts of $171 at December 31, 1999.

     REVENUES:

     Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
     terms of the related lease. The difference between the amount of rent due
     in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the
     "straight lining of rent adjustment." Rental income was increased by $2,501
     in 1999 due to the straight lining of rents. Percentage rents are
     recognized on an accrual basis. Recoveries from tenants for real estate
     taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are
     recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred.

     The Trust engages the Macerich Management Company (the "Management
     Company"), an affiliate of the Company, to manage the operations of the
     Trust. The Management Company provides property management, leasing,
     corporate, redevelopment and acquisitions services to the properties of the
     Trust. In consideration of these services, the Management Company receives
     monthly management fees ranging from 1.0% to 4.0% of the gross monthly
     rental revenue of the properties managed.

     PROPERTY:

     Costs related to the redevelopment, construction and improvement of
     properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until
     construction is substantially complete.

     Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as
     incurred. Realized gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or
     retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.

     Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line
     method over the estimated lives of the assets as follows:

     Building and improvements                                 5-39 years
     Tenant improvements                    initial term of related lease
     Equipment and furnishings                                    5 years

     The Trust assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of its
     long-lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating
     income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition
     and other economic factors. Such factors include the tenants' ability to
     perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. The Trust
     may recognize an impairment loss if the income stream is not sufficient to
     cover its investments. Such a loss would be determined between the carrying
     value and the fair value of a property. Management believes no such
     impairment has occurred in its net property carrying values at December 31,
     1999.

     DEFERRED CHARGES:

     Costs relating to financing of properties and obtaining tenant leases are
     deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement. The
     straight-line method is used to amortize all costs except financing, for
     which the effective interest method is used. The range of the terms of the
     agreements are as follows:

         Deferred lease costs                         1 -  9 years
         Deferred financing costs                     1 - 12 years

                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

     INCOME TAXES:

     The Trust has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code
     of 1986, as amended. A REIT is generally not subject to income taxation on
     that portion of its income that qualifies as REIT taxable income as long as
     it distributes at least 95% of its taxable income to its stockholders and
     complies with other requirements. Accordingly, no provision has been made
     for income taxes in the financial statements.

     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

     To meet the reporting requirements of SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair
     Value of Financial Instruments," the Trust calculates the fair value of
     financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes
     to the consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different
     than the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value
     reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is
     made. The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Trust
     using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
     However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to
     develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
     herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Trust could
     realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market
     assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on
     the estimated fair value amounts.

     CONCENTRATION OF RISK:

     The Trust maintains its cash accounts in a number of commercial banks.
     Accounts at these banks are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
     Corporation ("FDIC") up to $100. At various times during the year, the
     Trust had deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit.

     AT&T Wireless Services represented 9.5% of total minimum rents in place
     as of December 31, 1999, and no other tenant represented more than 2.7%
     of total minimum rents as of December 31, 1999.

     MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES:

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make
     estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
     liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
     date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
     and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
     from those estimates.

     (a) In connection with the acquisition of this property, the Trust assumed
         $127,000 of collateralized fixed rate notes (the ("Notes"). The Notes
         bear interest at an average fixed rate of 7.20% and mature in July
         2005. The Notes require the Trust to deposit all cash flow from the
         property operations with a trustee to meet its obligations under the
         Notes. Cash in excess of the required amount, as defined, is released.
         Included in cash and cash equivalents is $750 of restricted cash
         deposited with the trustee at December 31, 1999.

     (b) Concurrent with the acquisition of the property, the Trust placed
         $76,700 of debt and obtained a construction loan for an additional
         $16,000. Principal is drawn on the construction loan as costs are
         incurred. As of December 31, 1999, $6,745 of principal has been drawn
         under the construction loan.

     (c) In connection with the acquisition of this property, the Trust assumed
         $39,425 of debt. At acquisition, this debt was recorded at the fair
         value of $41,475 which included an unamortized premium of $2,050. This
         premium is being amortized as interest expense over the life of the
         loan using the effective interest method. The Trust's monthly debt
         service is $349 and is calculated based on an 8.60% interest rate. At
         December 31, 1999, the Trust's unamortized premium was $1,365.

     (d)  This loan pays interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%.  At December 31, 1999
          the total interest rate was 8.23%.

     (e) This represents the monthly payment of principal and interest.

4.  MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLE - CONTINUED:

     Certain mortgage loan agreements contain a prepayment penalty provision for
     the early extinguishment of the debt.

     Total interest costs capitalized during the period from February 18, 1999
     (Inception) through December 31, 1999 were $290.

     The fair value of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 1999 is estimated
     to be approximately $621,393 based on interest rates for comparable loans.

     The above debt matures as follows:

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

     The Partners
     SDG Macerich Properties, L.P.:

     We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of SDG Macerich Properties,
     L.P. as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related statements of
     operations, cash flows, and partners' equity for the years then ended. In
     connection with our audits of the financial statements, we have also
     audited the related financial statement schedule (Schedule III). These
     financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the
     responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to
     express an opinion on these financial statements and the financial
     statement schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
     standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
     obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
     of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
     evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
     statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
     and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
     overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
     provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
     in all material respects, the financial position of SDG Macerich
     Properties, L.P. as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its
     operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
     generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
     financial statement schedule (Schedule III), when considered in relation to
     the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
     material respects, the information set forth therein.

                           December 31, 1999 and 1998

                             (Dollars in thousands)

(1)  GENERAL

     (a)  PARTNERSHIP ORGANIZATION

          On December 29, 1997, affiliates of Simon Property Group, Inc.
          (Simon) and The Macerich Company (Macerich) formed a limited
          partnership to acquire and operate a portfolio of 12 regional
          shopping centers. SDG Macerich Properties, L.P. (the Partnership)
          acquired the properties on February 27, 1998, and the accompanying
          financial statements include the results of operations of the
          properties since the date of acquisition. As a result, the
          statement of operations presented for 1998 only represents ten
          months of activity.

     (b)  PROPERTIES

          Simon and Macerich have divided the property management services,
          and affiliates of each company manage six of the shopping centers.
          The shopping centers and their locations are as follows:

          Simon managed properties:

            South Park Mall                         Moline, Illinois
            Valley Mall                             Harrisonburg, Virginia
            Granite Run Mall                        Media, Pennsylvania
            Eastland Mall and Convenience Center    Evansville, Indiana
            Lake Square Mall                        Leesburg, Florida
            North Park Mall                         Davenport, Iowa

          Macerich managed properties:

            Lindale Mall                            Cedar Rapids, Iowa
            Mesa Mall                               Grand Junction, Colorado
            South Ridge Mall                        Des Moines, Iowa
            Empire Mall and Empire East             Sioux Falls, South Dakota
            Rushmore Mall                           Rapid City, South Dakota
            Southern Hills Mall                     Sioux City, Iowa


          The shopping center leases generally provide for fixed annual
          minimum rent, overage rent based on sales, and reimbursement for
          certain operating expenses, including real estate taxes. For
          leases in effect at December 31, 1999, fixed minimum rents to be
          received in each of the next five years and thereafter are
          summarized as follows:

(2)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     (a)  REVENUES

          All leases are classified as operating leases, and minimum rents
          are recognized monthly on a straight-line basis over the terms of
          the leases.

          Most retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based
          on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year,
          generally ending on January 31. Overage rents are recognized as
          revenues based on reported and estimated sales for each tenant
          through December 31, less a proration of the base amount.
          Differences between estimated and actual amounts are recognized in
          the subsequent year.

          During January 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force finalized
          Issue No. 98-9 on ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENT RENT. The EITF
          clarified the recognition of overage rent by stating that revenue
          for such contingent rent should not be recognized until the sales
          of the tenant have exceeded its base amount. The Partnership will
          be required to adopt this new method as of January 1, 2000. The
          effect of this pronouncement will be to delay the recognition of
          revenue until later in the year and into the subsequent year.
          Estimates of the effects of this change have not yet been
          determined.

          Tenant recoveries for real estate taxes and common area
          maintenance are adjusted annually based on the actual expenses,
          and the related revenues are recognized in the year in which the
          expenses are incurred. Charges for other operating expenses are
          billed monthly with periodic adjustments based on the estimated
          utility usage and/or a current price index, and the related
          revenues are recognized as the amounts are billed and as
          adjustments become determinable.

      (b) CASH EQUIVALENTS

          All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
          three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

     (c)  PROPERTIES

          Properties are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the
          straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
          as follows:

              Buildings and improvements     39 years
              Equipment and furnishings      5-7 years
              Tenant improvements            Initial term of related lease

          Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the
          useful life, increase capacity, or improve the efficiency of the
          asset. All other repairs and maintenance items are expensed as
          incurred.

          The Partnership assesses whether there has been an impairment in
          the value of a property by considering factors such as expected
          future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the
          effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such
          factors include the tenants' ability to perform their duties and
          pay rent under the terms of the leases. The Partnership would
          recognize an impairment loss if the estimated future income stream
          of a property is not sufficient to recover its investment. Such a
          loss would be the difference between the carrying value and the
          fair value of a property. Management believes no impairment in its
          net property carrying values has occurred at December 31, 1999 or
          1998.

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                           December 31, 1999 and 1998

                             (Dollars in thousands)

      (d)  USE OF ESTIMATES

           The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
           generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
           make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
           assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
           the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
           period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

      (e)  INCOME TAXES

           As a partnership, the allocated share of income or loss for the
           year is includable in the income tax returns of the partners;
           accordingly, income taxes are not reflected in the accompanying
           financial statements.

(3)   MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLE AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

      In connection with the acquisition of the properties, the Partnership
      assumed $485,000 of mortgage notes payable which are secured by liens on
      the properties. The notes consist of $300,000 of debt which is due in
      May 2006 and requires monthly interest payments at a fixed weighted
      average rate of 7.41% and $185,000 of debt which is due in May 2003 and
      requires monthly interest payments at a variable weighted average rate
      (based on LIBOR) of 6.96% at December 31, 1999 (5.86% at December 31,
      1998). The variable rate debt is covered by an interest cap agreement
      which effectively prevents the variable rate from exceeding 11.53%.

      The fair value assigned to the $300,000 fixed-rate debt at the
      acquisition date based on an estimated market interest rate of 6.23% was
      $322,711, and the resultant debt premium is being amortized to interest
      expense over the remaining term of the debt using a level yield method.
      At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the unamortized balance of the debt
      premium was $18,565 and $20,868, respectively.

      The fair value of the $300,000 fixed-rate debt at December 31, 1999 and
      1998 based on an interest rate of 8.34% and 6.70%, respectively, is
      estimated to be $266,530 and $312,000, respectively. The $185,000
      carrying value of the variable-rate debt and the Partnership's other
      financial instruments are estimated to equal their financial statement
      values.

      The Partnership intends to obtain additional mortgage financing secured
      by the properties of up to $140,000 in 2000. The new financing is
      expected to have the same maturity as the existing fixed rate mortgage
      notes, which mature on May 15, 2006.

(4)   MANAGEMENT SERVICES

      Management fees incurred in 1999 and 1998 totaled $1,960 and $1,592,
      respectively, for the Simon-managed properties and $1,803 and $1,470,
      respectively, for the Macerich-managed properties, both based on a fee
      of 4% of gross receipts, as defined.

(5)   CONTINGENT LIABILITY

      The Partnership currently is not involved with any litigation other than
      routine and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
      business. On the basis of consultation with counsel, management believes
      that these items will not have a material adverse impact on the
      Partnership's financial statements taken as a whole.

                              DUE NOVEMBER __, 2009



$1,000,000.00                                                   Los Angeles, CA
- --------------                                                November __, 1999


          FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Arthur M. Coppola, an individual ("MAKER"),
unconditionally promises to pay to The Macerich Company, a Maryland corporation
(together with any successor or assignee by operation of law or otherwise, the
"PAYEE"), on the earlier of December __, 2009 or such other date as provided
herein, in the manner and at the place hereinafter provided, the lesser of (i)
one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) and (ii) the unpaid principal amount of all
advances made by Payee to Maker for the purposes of Maker's purchase of common
stock of the Payee pursuant to the terms of The Macerich Company Amended and
Restated 1994 Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). All advances made under this Note
shall be noted hereon; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to make a notation
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Maker hereunder with
respect to payments of principal or interest on this Note.

          Maker also promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance of
this Note from the date such principal is advanced until such principal is paid
in full at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of: (i) the maximum amount
allowable pursuant to applicable law; or (ii) 7.00%. Interest that is due and
payable but not yet paid shall be added to principal and accrue interest from
the date due. Interest on this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day
year, based on the actual number of days elapsed and shall be payable in arrears
quarterly on the fifteenth (15th) day of each March, June, September and
December, commencing on March 15, 2000, upon any prepayment of this Note (to the
extent accrued on the amount being prepaid) and at maturity.

          1.   PAYMENTS; VOLUNTARY REPAYMENT. All payments of principal and
interest in respect of this Note shall be made in lawful money of the United
States of America. Each payment made hereunder shall be credited first to
interest then due and the remainder of such payment shall be credited to
principal, and interest shall thereupon cease to accrue upon the principal so
credited. Maker shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay
the principal of this Note in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, such
prepayment hereunder being accompanied by interest on the principal amount of
the Note being prepaid to the date of prepayment. Notwithstanding any payment or
prepayment of principal hereunder by Maker, Maker acknowledges and agrees that
the aggregate advances made by Payee hereunder shall in no event exceed the sum
of $1,000,000.

          2.   MANDATORY REPAYMENT.

          (a)  If the Board of Directors of Payee (the "Board") makes any
dividend or other distribution to its stockholders which it determines for these
purposes to be unusual or extraordinary (an "Extraordinary Distribution"), then
the Board, or the Compensation Committee of the Board, may, in its sole
discretion, require that Maker use the Net Cash Proceeds (as defined below) of
the Extraordinary Distribution to repay this Note. The Net Cash Proceeds shall
be applied first to accrued and unpaid interest on this Note and second to the
unpaid principal balance of this Note. As used herein, Net Cash Proceeds means
all cash or cash proceeds from an Extraordinary Distribution in respect of the
Pledged Collateral (as defined in that certain Pledge Agreement (the "Pledge
Agreement") dated as of November __, 1999 between Maker and Payee) MINUS the
amount of applicable federal, state and local taxes which the Board, or the
Compensation Committee of the Board, reasonably determines will be payable by
Maker in connection with the Extraordinary Distribution. The Board, or the
Compensation Committee of the Board, shall cause Payee to notify Maker in
writing at least 10 days prior to the payment date of any Extraordinary
Distribution with respect to which it intends to require Maker to use the Net

will remain free and clear of all adverse claims, pledges, liens, security
interests and other encumbrances, restrictions and rights whatsoever, except the
lien and security interest created by this Pledge Agreement.

<PAGE>

          (b)  BINDING OBLIGATION. Each of the Note and this Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Pledgor and is the legally valid and binding
obligation of Pledgor, enforceable against him in accordance with its terms,
except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws or equitable principles relating to or limiting
creditors' rights generally.

          (c)  PERFECTION. The pledge of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to this
Agreement creates a valid and perfected first priority security interest in the
Pledged Collateral, securing the payment of the Secured Obligations.

          (d)  OTHER INFORMATION. All information heretofore, herein or
hereafter supplied to Secured Party by or on behalf of Pledgor with respect to
the Pledged Collateral is and will be accurate and complete in all respects.

          (e)  NO CONSENTS. No consent, approval or authorization of or
designation or filing with any authority or third party on the part of Pledgor
is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of the
Note, this Agreement or the pledge and security interest granted pursuant to
this Agreement.

          SECTION 6. TRANSFERS AND OTHER LIENS; ADDITIONAL PLEDGED COLLATERAL;
RELEASE OF COLLATERAL.

          (a)  Pledgor shall not, without the prior written consent of Secured
Party (i) sell, assign (by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose
of, or grant any option with respect to, any of the Pledged Collateral or (ii)
create or suffer to exist any Lien upon or with respect to any of the Pledged
Collateral, except for the security interest under this Agreement.

          (b)  Pledgor shall pay promptly when due all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges or levies imposed upon, and all claims against, the Pledged
Collateral, except to the extent the validity thereof is being contested in good
faith; PROVIDED that Pledgor shall in any event pay such taxes, assessments,
charges, levies or claims not later than five days prior to the date of any
proposed sale under any judgement, writ or warrant of attachment entered or
filed against Pledgor or any of the Pledged Collateral as a result of the
failure to make such payment.

          (c)  Secured Party currently anticipates that it will consent to a
sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition (each, a "TRANSFER") of all or
any portion of the Pledged Collateral so long as: (i) Pledgor repays the Note to
the extent required by Section 2(b) thereof; (ii) no Event of Default is is
continuing under the Note and Pledgor is not in default of his obligations
hereunder; and (iii) the sale, assignment, transfer

                                        5
<PAGE>


or disposition, including the effect thereof on Secured Party, complies with
Section 1.8 of The Macerich Company Amended and Restated 1994 Incentive Plan and
any applicable Legal Limits (as determined by the Board in its sole discretion).
In the event of any such Transfer of Pledged Collateral to which Secured Party
has given its consent, Secured Party shall release its security interest and
lien with respect to the Pledged Collateral so transferred in accordance with
Section 6(d) below. Such release shall take place promptly upon receipt of the
proceeds of any required prepayment under the Note or, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, in advance of Secured Party's receipt of the proceeds if
Secured Party has received assurances satisfactory to Secured Party that such
release would be in conformity with any applicable Legal Limits and that all
such proceeds will be delivered to Secured Party. With respect to any
disposition of the Pledged Collateral under this Section 6(c), Pledgor shall pay
all costs and expenses, including broker's commissions, of such disposition.

          (d)  Upon any repayment of the principal of the Loan, whether a
voluntary or mandatory repayment, Secured Party shall, subject to any applicable
Legal Limits, release that percentage of the Pledged Collateral obtained by
dividing (i) the amount of such repayment, by (ii) the unpaid principal balance
of the Loan (prior to the repayment); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Pledged Collateral
shall be released only to the extent that the Fair Market Value of Pledged
Collateral remaining after such release is at least equal to the remaining
unpaid principal amount of the Loan.

          (e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6 to the contrary,
Pledgor may not sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any part of the
Pledged Collateral at any time that such sale, transfer, assignment or
disposition: (i) would violate any applicable Legal Limits or other applicable
law, including without limitation restrictions on insider trading; (ii) would
impair the Payee's ability to have any then-pending or completed transaction be
accounted for as a pooling of interests; or (iii) is prohibited by Secured
Party's policies relating to insider trading of its stock.

          SECTION 7. FURTHER ASSURANCES; PLEDGE AMENDMENTS.

          Pledgor agrees that from time to time Pledgor will promptly execute
and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all further action,
that may be necessary or desirable, or that Secured Party may request, in order
to perfect and protect any security interest granted or purported to be granted
hereby or to enable Secured Party to exercise and enforce its rights and
remedies hereunder with respect to any Pledged Collateral. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Pledgor will: (i) execute and file such financing
or continuation statements, or amendments thereto, and such other

                                        6
<PAGE>

instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as Secured Party
may request, in order to perfect and preserve the security interests granted or
purported to be granted hereby; (ii) deliver any certificates representing any
security issued in connection with any share dividend, share distribution, or
any other rights, whether as an addition to, in substitution for, or in exchange
for any of the Pledged Collateral together with stock transfer powers duly
endorsed in blank; and (iii) at Secured Party's request, appear in and defend
any action or proceeding that may affect Pledgor's title to or Secured Party's
security interest in all or any part of the Pledged Collateral.

          SECTION 8. VOTING RIGHTS; DIVIDENDS; ETC.

          (a)  So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing:

               (i)  Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and
          other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Collateral or any
          part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this
          Agree ment or the Note.

               (ii) Subject to the Mandatory Repayment Obligations, Pledgor may
          retain, and may utilize free and clear of the lien of this Agreement,
          all dividends, distributions and other payments paid (or payable) in
          cash with respect to the Pledged Collateral.

               (iii) All dividends, distributions and other payments paid or
          payable other than in cash in respect of, and instruments and other
          property received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of,
          or in exchange for, any Pledged Collateral shall be, and shall
          forthwith be delivered to, Secured Party to hold as Pledged Collateral
          and shall, if received by Pledgor, be received in trust for the
          benefit of Secured Party, be segregated from the other property or
          funds of Pledgor and be forthwith delivered to Secured Party as
          Pledged Collateral in the same form as so received (with all necessary
          endorsements); PROVIDED THAT Pledgor may retain, to the extent
          divisible, the portion of such non-cash dividends, distributions and
          other payments that the Board reasonably determines must be used by
          Pledgor for the sole purpose of paying taxes applicable to such
          dividends, distributions or other payments.

               (iv) Secured Party shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause
          to be executed and delivered) to Pledgor all such proxies, dividend
          payment orders and other instruments as Pledgor may from time to time
          reasonably request for the purpose of enabling Pledgor

                                        7

<PAGE>

          to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which it is
          entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (i) above and to receive
          the dividends, principal or interest payments which it is authorized
          to receive and retain pursuant to paragraph (ii) above.

Default:

          rights of Pledgor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights
          which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section
          8(a)(i) shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested
          in Secured Party who shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise
          such voting and other consensual rights.

               (ii) Without limiting the Mandatory Repayment Obligations, all
          rights of Pledgor to receive the dividends, distributions and other
          payments which it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain
          pursuant to Section 8(a)(ii) shall cease, and all such rights shall
          thereupon become vested in Secured Party who shall thereupon have the
          sole right to receive and hold as Pledged Collateral such dividends
          and interest payments.

               (iii) All dividends, distributions and other payments which are
          received by Pledgor contrary to the provisions of paragraph (ii) of
          this Section 8(b) shall be received in trust for the benefit of
          Secured Party, shall be segregated from other funds of Pledgor and
          shall forthwith be paid over to Secured Party as Pledged Collateral in
          the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsements).

          (c)  In order to permit Secured Party to exercise the voting and other
consensual rights which it may be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section
8(b)(i) and to receive all dividends and other distributions which it may be
entitled to receive under Section 8(a)(ii) or Section 8(b)(ii), (i) Pledgor
shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to
Secured Party all such proxies, dividend payment orders and other instruments as
Secured Party may from time to time reasonably request and (ii) without limiting
the effect of the immediately preceding clause (i), Pledgor hereby grants to
Secured Party an irrevocable proxy to vote (to the extent permitted by law) the
Pledged Shares and to exercise all other rights, powers, privileges and remedies
to which a holder of the Pledged Shares would be entitled (including, without
limitation, giving or withholding written consents of shareholders, calling
special meetings of shareholders and voting at such meetings), which proxy shall
be effective, automatically and without the necessity

                                        8
<PAGE>


of any action (including any transfer of any Pledged Shares on the record books
of the issuer thereof) by any other Person (including the issuer of the Pledged
Shares or any officer or agent thereof), upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default and which proxy shall only terminate upon the payment in full of the
Secured Obligations or the curing (as determined by Secured Party) of such Event
of Default.

          SECTION 9. SECURED PARTY APPOINTED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT. Pledgor hereby
irrevocably appoints Secured Party as Pledgor's attorney-in-fact, with full
authority in the place and stead of Pledgor and in the name of Pledgor, Secured
Party or otherwise, from time to time in Secured Party's discretion to take any
action and to execute any instrument that Secured Party may deem necessary or
advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including without
limitation:

          (a)  to file one or more financing or continuation statements, or
amendments thereto, relative to all or any part of the Pledged Collateral
without the signature of Pledgor;

          (b)  to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and
give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under or in
respect of any of the Pledged Collateral;

          (c)  to receive, endorse and collect any instruments made payable to
Pledgor representing any dividend, principal or interest payment or other
distribution in respect of the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof and to
give full discharge for the same; and

          (d)  to file any claims or take any action or institute any
proceedings that Secured Party may deem necessary or desirable for the
collection of any of the Pledged Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights
of Secured Party with respect to any of the Pledged Collateral.

          SECTION 10. SECURED PARTY MAY PERFORM. If Pledgor fails to perform any
agreement contained herein, Secured Party may itself perform, or cause
performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of Secured Party incurred in
connection therewith shall be payable by Pledgor under Section 13(b).

          SECTION 11. STANDARD OF CARE. The powers conferred on Secured Party
hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Pledged Collateral and shall
not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the exercise
of reasonable care in the custody of any Pledged Collateral in its possession
and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, Secured Party
shall have no duty as to any Pledged Collateral, it being understood that
Secured Party shall have no responsibility for (a) ascertaining or taking action
with respect to calls,

                                        9
<PAGE>

conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relating to any
Pledged Collateral, whether or not Secured Party has or is deemed to have
knowledge of such matters, (b) taking any necessary steps (other than steps
taken in accordance with the standard of care set forth above to maintain
possession of the Pledged Collateral) to preserve rights against any parties
with respect to any Pledged Collateral, (c) taking any necessary steps to
collect or realize upon the Secured Obligations or any guarantee therefor, or
any part thereof, or any of the Pledged Collateral, or (d) initiating any action
to protect the Pledged Collateral against the possibility of a decline in market
value. Secured Party shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the
custody and preservation of Pledged Collateral in its possession if such Pledged
Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which Secured Party
accords its own property consisting of negotiable securities.

          SECTION 12. REMEDIES.

          (a)  If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
all of the Secured Obligations shall immediately become due and payable and
Secured Party may exercise in respect of the Pledged Collateral, in addition to
all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it,
all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the Uniform
Commercial Code as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction (whether or not the
Uniform Commercial Code applies to the affected Pledged Collateral). Secured
Party shall have full recourse to Pledgor (directly and as to a deficiency in
respect of the Pledged Collateral) and the Pledged Collateral in respect of the
Secured Obligations arising under the Note. In exercising its remedies against
the Pledged Collateral, Secured Party may, upon ten (10) days' written notice to
Pledgor, but without any other demand or notice whatsoever, transfer ownership
of the Pledged Collateral to Secured Party in discharge of the Secured
Obligations to the extent of the Fair Market Value of the Pledged Collateral so
transferred, to the extent required to pay all of the Secured Obligations, such
transfer to be free and clear of any right or equity of redemption, which right
or equity is hereby expressly waived and released.

          (b)  In the event that Pledged Collateral is transferred to Secured
Party in discharge of any or all of the Secured Obligations as set forth in the
last sentence of the foregoing paragraph, such transfer shall be applied first
to all costs and expenses of such transfer and second to the Secured Obligations
arising in respect of the Note (first to interest and then to principal). All
proceeds received by Secured Party in respect of any sale of, collection from,
or other realization upon all or any part of the Pledged Collateral shall be
applied first to all costs and expenses of such sale, collection or other
realization and second to the Secured Obligations arising in respect of the Note
(first to interest and then to principal).

                                       10
<PAGE>

In the event that the amount received from the sale of, collection from, or
other realization upon the Pledged Collateral, or in the case of a transfer of
the Pledged Collateral to Secured Party, the Fair Market Value of the Pledged
Collateral, exceeds the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations (plus the
costs and expenses described above) Secured Party shall pay such excess to or
upon the order of Pledgor, or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive
the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. All rights and
remedies hereunder are in addition to whatever other rights the parties hereto
may otherwise have against one another, and no exercise of any such rights or
remedies shall be deemed to preclude the exercise of any other rights or
remedies.

          (c)  Pledgor recognizes that Secured Party may be unable to effect a
public sale or disposition of any or all the Pledged Collateral by reason of
certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act, the rules promulgated by
the SEC thereunder, and applicable state securities laws but may be compelled to
resort to one or more private sales or dispositions thereof to a restricted
group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire
such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the
distribution or resale thereof. Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any such
private sale or disposition may result in prices and other terms (including the
terms of any securities or other property received in connection therewith) less
favorable to the seller than if such sale or disposition were a public sale or
disposition and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such
private sale or disposition shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially
reasonable manner. Secured Party shall be under no obligation to delay a sale or
disposition of any of the Pledged Collateral to permit the registration of such
securities (or trust certificates representing such securities) for public sale
under the Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if the Company
would agree to do so.

          (d)  Pledgor further agrees to do or cause to be done all such other
acts and things as may be necessary to make such sale or sales or dispositions
of any portion or all of the Pledged Collateral valid and binding and in
compliance with any and all applicable laws, regulations, orders, writs,
injunctions, decrees or awards of any and all courts, arbitrators or
governmental instrumentalities, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over
any such sale or sales or dispositions, all at Pledgor's expense. Pledgor
further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section
12 will cause irreparable injury to Secured Party, that Secured Party has no
adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, agrees
that each and every covenant contained in this section shall be specifically
enforceable against Pledgor, and Pledgor hereby waives and agrees not to assert
any defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants

                                       11
<PAGE>

except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred hereunder.

          (e)  If Secured Party determines to exercise its right to sell any or
all of the Pledged Collateral, upon written request, Pledgor shall and shall
cause each issuer of any Pledged Shares to be sold hereunder from time to time
to furnish to Secured Party all such information as Secured Party may request in
order to determine the number of shares and other instruments included in the
Pledged Collateral which may be sold by Secured Party in exempt transactions
under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, as
the same are from time to time in effect.

          SECTION 13. INDEMNITY. Pledgor agrees to indemnify Secured Party from
and against any and all claims, losses and liabilities in any way relating to,
growing out of or resulting from this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, enforcement of this
Agreement), except to the extent such claims, losses or liabilities result
solely from Secured Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

          SECTION 14. CONTINUING SECURITY INTEREST; TRANSFER OF NOTE. This
Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Pledged Collateral
and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the payment in full of all
Secured Obligations, (b) be binding upon Pledgor, its successors and assigns,
and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of Secured Party hereunder,
to the benefit of Secured Party and its successors and assigns by operation of
law or otherwise. Upon the payment in full of all Secured Obligations, the
security interest granted hereby shall terminate and all rights to the Pledged
Collateral shall revert to Pledgor. Upon any such termination Secured Party
will, at Pledgor's expense, execute and deliver to Pledgor such documents as
Pledgor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination and Pledgor shall
be entitled to the return, upon its request and at its expense, against receipt
and without recourse to Secured Party, of such of the Pledged Collateral as
shall not have been sold or otherwise applied pursuant to the terms hereof.

          SECTION 15. AMENDMENTS; ETC. No amendment, modification, termination
or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by
Pledgor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by Secured Party and, in the case of any such amendment or
modification, by Pledgor. Any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in
the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given.

                                       12

          SECTION 16. NOTICES. Any notice or other communication herein required
or permitted to be given shall be in writing and may be personally served,
telexed or sent by telefacsimile or United States mail or courier service and
shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person or by courier
service, upon receipt of telefacsimile (with answer-back confirmation) or telex,
or three business days after depositing it in the United States mail with
postage prepaid and properly addressed. For the purposes hereof, the address of
each party hereto shall be as set forth under such party's name on the signature
pages hereof or, as to either party, such other address as shall be designated
by such party in a written notice delivered to the other party hereto.

          SECTION 17. FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.
No failure or delay on the part of Secured Party in the exercise of any power,
right or privilege hereunder shall impair such power, right or privilege or be
construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All
rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

          SECTION 18. SEVERABILITY. In case any provision in or obligation under
this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or
obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

          SECTION 19. HEADINGS. Section and subsection headings in this
Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose or be given any
substantive effect.

          SECTION 20. GOVERNING LAW; TERMS. This Agreement and the rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by, and shall be
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California
except: (i) for such matters as are subject to the jurisdiction of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Maryland; and (ii) to the extent that the
Uniform Commercial Code in effect in any jurisdiction provides that the validity
or perfection of the security interest hereunder, or remedies hereunder, in
respect of any particular pledged collateral are governed by the laws of a
jurisdiction other than the State of California. Unless otherwise defined herein
or in the Note, terms used in Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in
the State of California are used herein as therein defined.

          SECTION 21. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and any amendment hereto may
be executed in one or more counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one
and the same instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate
counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages
are physically attached to the same document.

                                       14

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Pledgor and Secured Party have caused this
Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the date first written above.
