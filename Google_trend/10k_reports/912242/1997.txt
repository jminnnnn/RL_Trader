PART I
- -------
Item I.  Business
- -----------------
	General
- --------
    	The Macerich Company (the "Company") is involved in the acquisition, 
ownership, redevelopment management and leasing of regional and community 
shopping centers located throughout the United States.  The Company is the 
sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, 
the Macerich Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating 
Partnership").  The Operating Partnership owns or has an ownership interest in 
23 regional shopping centers and three community centers aggregating 
approximately 19.1 million square feet of gross leasable area.  These 26 
regional and community shopping centers are referred to hereinafter as the 
"Centers", unless the context otherwise requires.  The Company is a  self-
administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") and 
conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the 
Company's two management companies, Macerich Property Management Company, a 
California corporation, and Macerich Management Company, a California 
corporation (collectively, the "Management Companies").

    	The Company was organized as a Maryland corporation in September 1993 to 
continue and expand the shopping center operations of Mace Siegel, Arthur M. 
Coppola, Dana K. Anderson and Edward C. Coppola (the "Principals") and certain 
of their business associates.

    	All references to the Company in this 10-K include the Company, those 
entities owned or controlled by the Company and predecessors of the Company, 
unless the context indicates otherwise.

Recent Developments
- -------------------
	Public Offering
 ---------------
     	During July, 1995, the Company filed a shelf registration statement for 
$250 million worth of securities to be issued at a later date, $112.0 million 
of which were issued in 1995. During October and November 1996 the Company 
sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock from the shelf (the "Equity Offering").  
The net proceeds of $122 million were used by the Company primarily to repay 
debt, to acquire Rimrock Mall, Vintage Faire Mall, Buenaventura Mall, Fresno 
Fashion Fair and Huntington Center and for general corporate purposes.  The 
contribution of the proceeds of the equity offering to the Operating 
Partnership, raised the Company's ownership interest in the Operating 
Partnership to 68%.  On February 5, 1997 the Company filed a new shelf 
registration statement for $500 million worth of securities (including the 
remaining $16 million under the former shelf) to be issued at a later date.  
The new shelf has not yet been declared effective.

	Acquisition Centers
 -------------------
     	Villa Marina Marketplace was acquired on January 25, 1996.  Villa Marina 
Marketplace is a 447,684 square foot community center/entertainment complex 
located in Marina del Rey, California.  The purchase price was $80 million, 
consisting of $57.6 million of cash and $22.4 million of assumed mortgage 
indebtedness.

    	Valley View Mall is a super regional mall in Dallas, Texas which the 
Company acquired on October 21, 1996.  Valley View Mall contains 1,523,815 
square feet and the purchase price was $85.5 million in cash plus the 
assumption of $2.0 million in other liabilities. 

    	Rimrock Mall, located in Billings, Montana, and Vintage Faire Mall, 
located in Modesto, California were both purchased on November 27, 1996.  The 
combined purchase price was $118.2 million, including the assumption of $88.4 
million of existing mortgage indebtedness, the assumption of $3.0 million of 
other liabilities and with the balance being paid in cash.  Vintage Faire Mall 
is a super regional mall with 1,051,458 square feet and Rimrock Mall is a 
regional mall consisting of 581,912 square feet.

    	Buenaventura Mall, Fresno Fashion Fair and Huntington Center were 
purchased on December 18, 1996 for a combined price of $128.9 million, 
including $38 million of assumed mortgage indebtedness, assumption of $3.8 
million of other liabilities and the balance was paid in cash.  Buenaventura 
Mall, located in Ventura, California, is an 801,152 square foot super regional 
mall, Fresno Fashion Fair, located in Fresno, California, is a  super regional 
mall containing 881,334 square feet and Huntington Center, located in 
Huntington Beach, California, consists of 834,578 square feet.

    	The addition of the 1996 Acquisition Centers brings the Company's 
portfolio to 23 Regional Shopping Centers and three Community Shopping 
Centers, comprising more than 19.1 million square feet.

	Financings
 ----------
    	On April 1, 1996 the mortgage debt on Crossroads-OK, Greentree Mall, and 
Salisbury was refinanced.  The total indebtedness on these centers was 
increased to $117 million, from $88 million, and the average interest rate was 
fixed at 7.2%.  On September 30, 1996 the $65.1 million mortgage loan at 
Queens Center was refinanced.  The interest rate was reduced from LIBOR plus 
1.10% to LIBOR plus 0.45%.  On December 23, 1996 the Villa Marina Marketplace 
mortgage debt of $22 million was paid off.  Additionally, a $60 million 
mortgage was placed on Valley View Mall concurrent with its acquisition.  The 
interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.50% and the loan matures in October, 1997, but 
can  be converted into a fixed rate loan that matures in October, 2006.  
Concurrent with the acquisition of Buenaventura Mall, Fresno Fashion Fair and 
Huntington Center, a $57 million unsecured loan was obtained.  The loan bears 
interest at LIBOR plus 1.625% and matures on December 31, 1997.

The Shopping Center Industry
- ----------------------------
	General
 -------
    	There are several types of retail shopping centers, which are 
differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy.  Retail 
shopping centers, generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gross 
leasable area ("GLA"), and are typically anchored by two or more department or 
large retail stores ("Anchors"), are referred to as "Regional Shopping 
Centers" or "Malls".  Regional Shopping Centers also typically contain 
numerous diversified retail stores ("Mall Stores"), most of which are national 
or regional retailers, typically located along corridors connecting the 
Anchors.  Community Shopping Centers, also referred to as "strip centers," are 
retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood 
customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount 
department stores and/or drug stores.  Community Shopping Centers typically 
contain 100,000 square feet to 400,000 square feet of GLA.  In addition, 
freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping 
centers ("Freestanding Stores"). Anchors, Mall and Freestanding Stores and 
other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common 
areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related 
to the operation of the shopping center.

	Regional Shopping Centers
 -------------------------
    	A Regional Shopping Center draws from its trade area by offering a 
variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, 
generally in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient 
parking.  Regional Shopping Centers provide an array of retail shops and 
entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and the preferred 
gathering place for community, charity, and promotional events.

    	The Company focuses on the acquisition and redevelopment of Regional 
Shopping Centers.  Regional Shopping Centers have generally provided owners 
with relatively stable growth in income despite the cyclical nature of the 
retail business.  This stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and 
to the typical dominance of Regional Shopping Centers in their trade areas.  
Regional Shopping Centers are difficult to develop because of the significant 
barriers to entry, including the limited availability of capital and suitable 
development sites, the presence of existing Regional Shopping Centers in most 
markets, a limited number of Anchors, and the associated development costs and 
risks.  Consequently, the Company believes that few new Regional Shopping 
Centers will be built in the next five years.  However, many of the market, 
financing and economic risks typically associated with the development of new 
Regional Shopping Centers can be mitigated by acquiring and redeveloping an 
existing Regional Shopping Center.  Furthermore, the value of Regional 
Shopping Centers can be significantly enhanced through redevelopment, 
renovation and expansion. 

    	Regional Shopping Centers have different strategies with regard to 
price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet 
the needs of their trade areas.  Anchor tenants are located along common areas 
in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of 
the Mall Stores.  Mall GLA, which generally refers to gross leasable area 
contiguous to the Anchors for tenants other than Anchors, is leased to a wide 
variety of smaller retailers.  Mall stores typically account for the bulk of 
the revenues of a Regional Shopping Center.

    	Although a variety of retail formats compete for consumer purchases, the 
Company believes that Regional Shopping Centers will continue to be a 
preferred shopping destination.  The combination of a climate controlled 
shopping environment and a diverse tenant mix has resulted in Regional 
Shopping Centers generating higher tenant sales than are generally achieved at 
smaller retail formats.  Further, the Company believes that department stores 
located in Regional Shopping Centers will continue to provide a full range of 
current fashion merchandise at a limited number of locations in any one 
market, allowing them to command the largest geographical trade area of any 
retail format.
                                           2
<PAGE>
	Community Shopping Centers
 --------------------------
    	Community Shopping Centers are designed to attract local and 
neighborhood customers and are typically open air shopping centers, with one 
or more supermarkets, drugstores or discount department stores.  National 
retailers such as Kids-R-Us at Bristol Shopping Center, Toys-R-Us at 
Marshall's Boulder Plaza, and The Gap, Victoria's Secret and Limited Express 
at Villa Marina, provide the Company's three Community Shopping Centers with 
the opportunity to draw from a much larger trade area than a typical 
supermarket or drugstore anchored Community Shopping Center.

Business of the Company
- -----------------------
	Management and Operating Philosophy
 -----------------------------------
    	The Company believes that the shopping center business requires 
specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and 
profitable operations.  For this reason, the Company has developed a fully 
integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, redevelopment, 
property management, leasing, finance, construction, marketing, legal and 
accounting expertise.  In addition, the Company emphasizes a philosophy of 
decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site 
professionals.  The Company believes that this strategy results in the optimal 
operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each Center as well as the ability 
to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the Center's trade 
area.

    	Property Management and Leasing.  The Company believes that on-site 
property managers can most effectively operate the Centers.  Each Center's 
property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, 
maintenance and security functions at the Center.  Property managers focus 
special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the 
profitability of the Centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with 
and to be responsive to the needs of retailers.

    	The Company believes strongly in decentralized leasing and accordingly, 
most of its leasing managers are located on-site to better understand the 
market and the community in which a Center is located.  Leasing managers are 
charged with more than the responsibility of leasing space; they continually 
assess and fine tune each Center's tenant mix, identify and replace 
underperforming tenants and seek to optimize existing tenant sizes and 
configurations.

    	Acquisitions.  Since the IPO, the Company, has acquired interests in 
shopping centers nationwide.  These acquisitions were identified and 
consummated by the Company's staff of acquisition professionals who are 
strategically located in Santa Monica, Dallas, Denver, and Atlanta.  The 
Company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and 
maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial 
institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise.

    	Concurrent with its IPO, the Company acquired Crossroads Mall in 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma ("Crossroads-Oklahoma").  In addition, on July 21, 
1994, the Company acquired Chesterfield Towne Center in Richmond, Virginia 
("Chesterfield").  Together these properties are known as the "1994 
Acquisition Centers".  The Company made the following acquisitions during 
1995:  The Centre at Salisbury in Salisbury, Maryland ("Salisbury") on August 
15, 1995,  Capitola Mall in Capitola, California ("Capitola") on December 21, 
1995, and Queens Center in New York, New York ("Queens Center") on December 
28, 1995.  Together these properties are known as the "1995 Acquisition 
Centers".  The Company made the following acquisitions in 1996: Villa Marina 
Marketplace ("Villa Marina") on January 25, 1996; Valley View Mall on October 
21, 1996; Vintage Faire Mall and Rimrock Mall on November 27, 1996; and 
Buenaventura Mall, Fresno Fashion Fair and Huntington Center on December 18, 
1996.  Together these properties are referred to as "1996 Acquisition 
Centers".  

    	Redevelopment.  One of the major components of the Company's growth 
strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties.  For this reason, 
the Company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary 
responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that will result in 
enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the Centers.  The 
redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the 
projects in addition to obtaining required governmental and Anchor approvals.

	Management and Operating Philosophy, Continued:
 -----------------------------------------------
    	The Centers.  The Centers consist of twenty-three Regional Shopping 
Centers and three Community Shopping Centers aggregating approximately 19.1 
million square feet of GLA.  Twelve of the Centers have been acquired 
concurrent with or since the IPO including two acquired by the Company in 
1994, three acquired in 1995, and seven in 1996.  All of the Company's 
Regional Shopping Centers are enclosed, with the exception of Broadway Plaza, 
an open air Regional Shopping Center located in Walnut Creek, California.   
Twenty of the twenty-three Regional Shopping Centers combine three or more 
Anchors with numerous diversified Mall Stores, most of which are national or 
regional retailers.  In addition, there are Freestanding Stores at most of the 
Centers.  Twenty-three of the 26 Centers contain more than 400,000 square feet 
of GLA.  The 23 Regional Shopping Centers in the Company's portfolio average 
approximately 795,478 square feet of GLA and range in size from 1.8 million 
square feet of GLA at Lakewood Mall to 369,670 square feet of GLA at Panorama 
Mall.  The Company's three Community Shopping Centers, Marshall's Boulder 
Plaza, Villa Marina Marketplace and Bristol Shopping Center have an average of 
257,435 square feet of GLA.  The 26 Centers presently include 86 Anchors 
totaling approximately 11.2 million square feet of GLA and approximately 2,452 
Mall and Freestanding Stores totaling approximately 7.9 million square feet of 
GLA.

    	Total revenues increased from $86.0 million in 1994 to $102.5 million in 
1995 and $155.1 million in 1996 primarily due to acquisitions.  See 
"Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations."  Lakewood Mall generated 16.0% of total shopping center revenues 
in 1996, 22.0% in 1995 and 25.6% in 1994.  Shopping center revenues at 
Crossroads Mall-Colorado accounted for 10.6% of total shopping center revenues 
in 1995 and 12.16% in 1994.  During 1995 Chesterfield accounted for 12.6% of 
total Shopping Center revenues.  Queens Center accounted for 13.8% of 1996 
shopping center revenue.  No other Center generated more than 10% of shopping 
center revenues during 1996, 1995 or 1994.

	Cost of Occupancy
- -------------------
    	The Company's management believes that in order to maximize the 
Company's operating cash flow, the Centers' Mall Store tenants must be able to 
operate profitably.  A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is 
cost of occupancy.  The following table summarizes occupancy costs for  Mall 
Store tenants in the Centers as a percentage of total Mall Store sales for the 
last three years:

	Competition
 -----------
    	The 23 Regional Shopping Centers are located in developed areas in 
middle to upper income markets where there are relatively few other Regional 
Shopping Centers.  In addition, 22 of the 23 Regional Shopping Centers contain 
more than 400,000 square feet of GLA. The Company intends to consider 
additional expansion and renovation projects to maintain and enhance the 
quality of the Centers and their competitive position in their trade areas.

	Competition, Continued:
 -----------------------
    	There are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete 
with the Company in its trade areas. This results in competition for both 
acquisition of centers and for tenants to occupy space.  The existence of 
competing shopping centers could have a material impact on the Company's 
ability to lease space and on the level of rent that can be achieved.  There 
is also increasing competition from other forms of retail, such as factory 
outlet centers, power centers, discount shopping clubs, and home shopping 
networks that could adversely affect the Company's revenues.

Major Tenants
- -------------
    	The Centers derived approximately 88.8% of their total rents for the 
year ended December 31, 1996 from Mall and Freestanding Stores.  No single 
retailer accounted for more than 6.5% of annual base rents of the Company as 
of December 31, 1996.  

	The following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 
largest retailers in the Company's portfolio based upon minimum rents in place 
as of December 31, 1996:

	Mall and Freestanding Stores
 ----------------------------
    	Mall and Freestanding Store leases generally provide for tenants to pay 
rent comprised of a fixed base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based 
on sales.  In some cases, tenants pay only a fixed minimum rent, and in a few 
cases, tenants pay only percentage rents.  Most leases for Mall and 
Freestanding Stores contain provisions that allow the Centers to recover their 
costs for maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, 
advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the Center.

    	The Company uses tenant spaces 10,000 square feet and under for 
comparing rental rate activity.  Tenant space under 10,000 square feet 
comprises 76.0% of all Mall and Freestanding Store space.  The Company 
believes that to include space over 10,000 square feet would provide a less 
meaningful comparison, especially on a quarterly basis.

    	When an existing lease expires, the Company is often able to enter into 
a new lease with a higher base rent component.  The average base rent for new 
Mall and Freestanding Store leases, 10,000 square feet or under, commencing 
during 1996 was $27.02 per square foot, or 13.1% higher than the average base 
rent for all Mall and Freestanding Stores (10,000 square feet or under) at 
December 31, 1996 of $23.90 per square foot.

</TABLE>


(1)  Average base rent per square foot is based on Mall and Freestanding Store 
GLA for spaces 10,000 square feet or under occupied as of December 31 for 
each of the Centers owned by the Company in  1994, 1995 (excluding the 1995 
Acquisition Centers), and 1996 (excluding the 1996 Acquisition Centers).  
If the 1995 Acquisition Centers were included, the 1995 average would be 
$22.86, and if the 1996 Acquisition Centers were included, the 1996 average 
would be $23.58.  
 
(2)  The base rent on lease signings during the year represents the actual rent 
to be paid on a per square foot basis during the first twelve months.  The 
1995 average excludes the 1995 Acquisition Centers and the 1996 average 
excludes the 1996 Acquisition Centers.

(3)  The average base rent on leases expiring during the year represents the 
final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for tenant leases 10,000 square 
feet or under expiring during the year.  The average base rent on leases 
expiring in 1995 excludes the 1995 Acquisition Centers and 1996 excludes 
the 1996 Acquisition Centers.

	Bankruptcy and Closure of Retail Stores
 ---------------------------------------
     The bankruptcy and/or closure of an Anchor, or its sale to a less 
desirable retailer, could adversely affect customer traffic in a Center and 
thereby reduce the income generated by that Center.  Furthermore, the closing 
of an Anchor could, under certain circumstances, allow certain other Anchors 
or other tenants to terminate their leases or cease operating their stores at 
the Center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the Center.  During the 
fourth quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of 1996 there were a significant 
number of retailer bankruptcies and closures.  As a result, the Company 
experienced slightly lower same center occupancies in 1996 compared to 1995.

    	Retail stores at the Centers other than Anchors may also seek the 
protection of the bankruptcy laws, which could result in the termination of 
such tenants' leases and thus cause a reduction in the cash flow generated by 
the Centers.  Although no single retailer accounts for greater than 6.5% of 
total rents, the bankruptcy and subsequent closure of stores could create a 
decrease in occupancy levels, reduced rental income or otherwise adversely 
affect the Centers.

	Anchors
- --------
    	Anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's
identification with Regional Shopping Centers.  Anchors are generally
department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers.  
Although the Centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income
from Anchors than from Mall and Freestanding Stores, strong Anchors play an
important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the Centers 
desirable locations for Mall and Freestanding Store tenants.

    	Anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases
adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates
that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of Mall and Freestanding 
Stores.  	

    	Anchors accounted for approximately 11.2% of the Company's total rent for
the year ended December 31, 1996.  Each Anchor which owns its own store, and
certain Anchors which lease their stores, enter into reciprocal easement 
agreements with the owner of the Center covering, among other things,
operational matters, initial construction and future expansion.

(1) The Broadway Stores merged with Federated Department Stores, Inc. 
("Federated") during November 1995. As part of that merger, Federated 
closed the Broadway stores at Panorama and Huntington Center and the 
Weinstock's store at Parklane.  Federated is negotiating to sell the 
Panorama location.  

(2) On January 25, 1997, J.C. Penney ceased operating at County East Mall.  
The Company is currently negotiating with potential replacement tenants.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------
    	Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, 
an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of 
certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in such property.  Such laws often 
impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was 
responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.  The 
costs of investigation, removal or remediation of such substances may be 
substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly 
remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or 
rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral.  Persons 
who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may 
also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a release of such 
substances at a disposal treatment facility, whether or not such facility is 
owned or operated by such person.  Certain environmental laws impose liability 
for release of asbestos-containing materials ("ACMs") into the air and third 
parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for 
personal injury associated with ACMs. In connection with the ownership (direct 
or indirect), operation, management and development of real properties, the 
Company may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having 
arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and 
therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as 
certain other related costs, including governmental fines and injuries to 
persons and property.

    	Each of the Centers has been subjected to a Phase I audit (which 
involves review of publicly available information and general property 
inspections, but does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) 
completed by an environmental consultant.

    	Based on these audits, and on other information, the Company is aware of 
the following environmental issues that are reasonably possible to result in 
costs associated with future investigation or remediation, or in environmental 
liability:

      Asbestos.  The Company has conducted ACM surveys at various 
locations within the Centers, which have indicated that ACMs are 
present or suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor 
tiles, mastics, roofing materials, drywall tape, joint compounds 
and acoustical ceiling tiles.  The identified ACMs are generally 
non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities for 
disturbance.  At certain Centers where ACMs are present or suspected,
however,some ACMs have been or may be classified as "friable," and
ultimately may require removal under certain conditions.  The Company
has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance (O&M) plan
to manage ACM in place.
 
      Underground Storage Tanks.  Underground storage tanks ("USTs") are 
or were present at certain of the Centers, often in connection 
with tenant operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, 
battery and accessory service centers located at such Centers.  
USTs also may be or have been present at properties neighboring 
certain Centers.  Certain of these tanks have either leaked or are 
suspected to have leaked.  Where leakage has occurred, 
investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred 
by the Company, if the responsible current or former tenant, or 
other responsible parties are unavailable to pay such costs.
 
  Chlorinated Hydrocarbons.  The presence of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons such as perchloroethylene (PCE) and its degradation 
byproducts has been detected at certain of the Centers, often in 
connection with tenant dry cleaning operations.  Where PCE has 
been detected, the Company may incur investigation, remediation 
and monitoring costs if responsible tenants, or other responsible 
parties, are unavailable to pay such costs.

Environmental Matters, Continued:
- ---------------------------------
    	PCE has been detected in soil and groundwater in the vicinity of a dry 
cleaning establishment at North Valley Plaza.  The California Department of 
Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) has advised the Company that very low levels 
of Dichlorethylene (1,2,DCE) a degradation byproduct of PCE, have been 
detected in a water well located 1/4 mile west from the dry cleaners, and 
the dry cleaning facility may have contributed to the introduction of 1,2 
DCE into the water well.  According to DTSC, the maximum contaminant level 
(MCL) for 1,2DCE which is permitted in drinking water is 6 parts per 
billion (ppb); and that the 1,2DCE was detected in the water well at 1.2 
ppb, which is below the MCL.  The Company has retained an environmental 
consultant and has initiated extensive testing of the site, although the 
extent of the impacted soil and groundwater has not been fully defined.  
Redmediation is scheduled to begin in the first half of 1997.  The joint 
venture that owns that property (of which the Company is a 50% general 
partner) has a $685,000 reserve, plus $155,000 has already been incurred, 
to cover professional fees, testing and remediation costs.   The Company 
intends to look to the responsible parties and insurers if remediation is 
required.

    Toluene, a petroleum constituent, has been detected in a groundwater 
dewatering system at the Queens Center.  The source of the toluene is 
currently unknown, but it is possible that an adjacent  service station has 
caused or contributed to the problem.  It is also possible that the toluene 
remains from previous service station operations which occurred on site 
prior to the development of the site into its current use in the early 
1970s.  Toluene was detected at levels of 410 and 160 parts per billion 
(ppb) in samples taken from the tank in October, 1995 and February, 1996, 
respectively.  Additional samples were taken in May and December of 1996, 
with results of .63 ppb and "non-detect" for the May sampling event and 
16.2 ppb and 25.2 ppb for the December sampling event.  The maximum 
contaminant level (MCL) for toluene in drinking water is 150 ppb.  Although 
the Company believes that no remediation will be required, it has set up a 
$150,000 reserve to cover professional fees and testing costs.  The Company 
intends to look to the responsible parties and insurers if remediation is 
required.

     Dry cleaning chemicals, including PCE have been detected in soil and 
groundwater in the vicinity of a dry cleaning establishment at Villa Marina 
Marketplace.  The previous owner of the property has reported the release 
to the local government authorities and has agreed to fully assess and 
remediate the site to the extent required by those authorities subject to a 
limited indemnity agreement.  The previous owner has removed the dominant 
source of impacted soil and is continuing its efforts to assess the site 
under the direction of the local regulatory oversight agency.  Although the 
Company believes that it will not be required to participate in assessment 
or remediation activities, it has set up a $150,000 reserve ($20,000 of 
which has already been incurred) to cover professional and legal fees.

    	The Company acquired Fresno Fashion Fair in December, 1996.  Asbestos 
has been detected in structural fireproofing throughout much of the Mall.  
Recent testing data conducted by a professional environmental consulting 
firms indicates that the fireproofing is largely inaccessible to building 
occupants and is well adhered to the structural members.  Additionally, 
airborne concentrations of asbestos are well within OSHA's permissible 
exposure limit (PEL) of .1 fcc. The accounting for this acquisition 
included a reserve of $3.3 million to cover future removal of this 
asbestos, as necessary.

    	Dry cleaning chemicals including perchloroethylene (PCE) were detected 
in soil and groundwater in the vicinity of a former dry cleaning 
establishment at Huntington Center.  The release has been reported to the 
local government authorities.  The Company estimates, based on the data 
currently available, that costs for assessment, remediation and legal 
services will not exceed $500,000.  Consequently, at the time of the 
acquisition, the Company established a $500,000 reserve to cover 
professional and legal fees.  The company intends to look to responsible 
parties and insurers for cost recovery.

Employees
- ---------
    	The Company and the Management Companies employ approximately 910 
persons, including six executive officers, personnel in the areas of 
acquisitions and business development (8), property management (127), leasing 
(32), redevelopment/construction (18), financial services (37) and legal 
affairs (8).  In addition, in an effort to minimize operating costs, the 
Company generally maintains its own security staff (304) and maintenance staff 
(370). Approximately 6 of these employees are represented by a union.  The 
Company believes that relations with its employees are good.

Item 2.  Properties, Continued
- ------------------------------
(1) The land underlying twenty of the Centers is owned entirely by the 
Company or, in the case of jointly-owned Centers, the property 
partnership in fee.  All or part of the land underlying the remaining 
Centers is owned by third parties and leased to the Company or property 
partnership pursuant to long-term ground leases.  Under the terms of a 
typical ground lease, the Company or property partnership pays rent for 
the use of the land and is generally responsible for all costs and 
expenses associated with the building and improvements.  In some cases, 
the Company or property partnership has an option or right of first 
refusal to purchase the land.  The termination dates of the ground 
leases range from 2013 to 2060.     

All centers are wholly owned by the Company or its subsidiaries, except 
for Broadway Plaza (50%), North Valley Plaza (50%), Panorama Mall (50%), 
and West Acres (19%).

(2) Includes GLA attributable to Anchors (whether owned or leased) and Mall 
and Freestanding Stores as of December 31, 1996.
 
(3) J.C. Penney vacated its facility at County East Mall  in 1997.
 
(4) The Company negotiated an early termination of  the Fashion Bar lease.  
Fashion Bar closed on January 15, 1997.  The Company is currently 
negotiating with a replacement tenant.
 
(5) Federated closed the Weinstock's store at Parklane Mall and the Company 
acquired Federated's leasehold interest.  The Company is planning to 
demolish the Weinstocks building and redevelop this area as a location 
based entertainment complex.
 
(6) J.C. Penney vacated its facility at North Valley Plaza in 1993.  The 
Company has relocated the existing 60,000 square foot Mervyn's at the 
Center into the larger J.C. Penney building.  The Company is in 
negotiations for a replacement tenant for the Mervyn's building.
 
(7) Federated Department Stores, Inc. merged with Broadway Stores, Inc. in 
November, 1995.  Federated owns the Broadway Store at Panorama.  This 
Broadway Store ceased operations in January 1996.  Federated is 
currently negotiating to sell this building to Wal-Mart.

(8) Sales are based on reports by retailers leasing Mall and Freestanding 
Stores for the year ending December 31, 1996 for tenants which have 
occupied such stores for a minimum of twelve months.  Consistent with 
industry practices, sales per square foot are based on gross leased and 
occupied area, excluding theaters, and are not based on GLA.

(9) Portions of the land on which the Center is situated are subject to one 
or more ground leases.

(10) Edwards Cinema signed a lease in January 1997 to occupy the former 
Broadway location.  Edwards is expected to open a 21 screen theater 
complex on that site in May 1998.

(11) Certain spaces have been intentionally held off the market and remain 
vacant due to major redevelopment strategy.  As a result, the Company 
believes the percentage of mall and free-standing GLA leased at these 
major redevelopments is not meaningful data.

	Notes:

(1)    The annual debt service payment represents the payment of principal and 
       interest.  In addition, contingent interest, as defined in the loan 
       agreement, may be due to the extent that 35% of the gross receipts
       (as defined in the loan agreement) exceeds a base amount specified 
       therein.  Contingent interest recognized was $75,910 for the period 
       from July 21, 1994 (the date of acquisition of Chesterfield) 
       to December 31, 1994, $184,321 for the year ended December 31, 1995 
       and $398,619 for the year ended December 31, 1996.

(2)    No prepayment except under certain circumstances in the event of the 
       sale of the Center.

(3)    This debt was issued at a discount.  The unamortized discount at 
       December 31, 1996 was $463,000.  The above balance is net of the 
       discount.                

(4)    The interest rate is LIBOR plus .45%.  LIBOR was 5.55% at December 31,
       1996.  There is an interest rate cap on $10 million of this debt at a 
       LIBOR strike rate of 5.88% through maturity.  The remaining principal 
       has an interest rate cap with a LIBOR strike rate of  7.07% from 
       December 31, 1996 to December 30, 1997, and 7.7% thereafter.

(5)   The Valley View loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%.  The Company 
      can elect to convert the loan to a fixed rate, ten year loan at any 
      time up to October 21, 1997.

(6)   Reflects the Company's pro rata share of debt.

Mortgage Debt, Continued
      ------------------------
    	The Company has also obtained a $50 million unsecured working capital line 
of credit with a financial institution which bears interest at approximately 
LIBOR plus 1.625% or the institution's prime rate.  There was $12 million 
outstanding on this line as of December 31, 1996.  In addition, the Company has 
a $57 million unsecured bank loan bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.625% due 
December 31, 1997.  This debt was incurred in connection with the Fresno 
Fashion Fair, Huntington Center and Buenaventura Mall acquisitions.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.
- --------------------------

    	The Company, the Operating Partnership, the Management Companies and the 
affiliated partnerships are not currently involved in any material litigation 
nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any material litigation currently
threatened against such entities or the Centers, other than routine litigation
arising in the ordinary course of business, most of which is expected to be
covered by liability insurance.  For information about certain environmental
matters, see "Business of the Company - Environmental Matters."


Item 4.  Submission of Matter to a Vote of Security Holders.

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data.

    	The following sets forth selected financial data for the Company on a 
historical and pro forma consolidated basis, and for the Centers and the 
Management Companies (collectively, the "Predecessor"), on an historical 
combined basis. The following data should be read in conjunction with the 
financial statements (and the notes thereto) of the Company and the 
Predecessor and "Management's Discussion And Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations" each included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

    	The pro forma data for the Company for the year ended December 31, 1994 
has been prepared as if the IPO and the transactions related to the 
reorganization of the Operating Partnership and formation of the Company (the 
"Formation") and the application of the net proceeds of the IPO had occurred 
as of January 1, 1994.  The pro forma information is not necessarily 
indicative of what the Company's financial position or results of operations 
would have been assuming the completion of the Formation and IPO at the 
beginning of the period indicated, nor does it purport to project the 
Company's financial position or what results of operations would have been 
assuming the completion of the Formation and the IPO at the beginning of the 
period indicated, nor does it purport to project the Company's financial 
position or results of operations at any future date or for any future period.

    	The Selected Financial Data is presented on a combined basis.  The 
limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (not owned by the 
REIT) are reflected in the pro forma data as minority interest.  Centers in 
which the Company does not have a greater than 50% ownership interest 
(Panorama Mall, North Valley Plaza, Broadway Plaza and West Acres Shopping 
Center) are referred to as the "Joint Venture Centers", and along with the 
Management Companies, are reflected in the selected financial data under the 
equity method of accounting.  Accordingly, the net income from the Joint 
Venture Centers and the Management Companies that is allocable to the Company 
and the Predecessor is included on the statement of operations as Income of 
uncombined joint ventures and management companies.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
         Results of Operations
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 
"Selected Financial Data" and the Company's Consolidated and Predecessor 
Combined Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this 
10-K.

General Background and Performance Measurement
- -----------------------------------------------
	The Company receives income primarily from two sources:

(1) Through its ownership of wholly-owned Centers.
(2) Through its ownership interests in Joint Venture Centers which 
include Panorama Mall (50%), Broadway Plaza (50%), North Valley 
Plaza (50%), and West Acres Shopping Center (19%).





                                          18
<PAGE>


General Background and Performance Measurement, Continued
- ---------------------------------------------------------
    	The Company believes that the most significant measures of its operating 
performance are Funds from Operations and EBITDA.  Funds from Operations is 
defined as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding 
gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of property, plus 
depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and 
amortization of loan and financial instrument costs), and after adjustments 
for unconsolidated entities.  Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are 
calculated on the same basis.  Funds from Operations does not represent cash 
flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of 
cash available to fund all cash flow needs. 

     EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, 
amortization, minority interest, income in unconsolidated entities and 
extraordinary items.  This data is relevant to an understanding of the 
economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available 
from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations.  EBITDA 
should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator 
of the Company's operating performance, or to cash flows from operating 
activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of 
liquidity.  While the performance of individual Centers and the Management 
Companies determines EBITDA, the Company's capital structure also influences 
Funds from Operations.  The most important component in determining EBITDA and 
Funds from Operations is Center revenues.  Center revenues consist primarily 
of minimum rents, percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries. Minimum 
rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents 
that are higher than prior rents.  Minimum rent will also fluctuate up or down 
with changes in the occupancy level.  Additionally, to the extent that new 
leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms, expense 
recoveries will increase.

    	Percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant 
sales.  As leases roll over, however, a significant portion of historical 
percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent.  It is therefore common 
for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase.  Accordingly, in 
discussing financial performance, the Company combines minimum and percentage 
rents in order to better measure revenue growth.

    	The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated 
financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 
1995, and for the period from March 16, 1994 (commencement of operations) 
through December 31, 1994, and the combined financial statements of Macerich 
Predecessor Affiliates ("Predecessor") for the period from January 1, 1994 
through March 15, 1994.  The combined financial statements of the Predecessor 
combine the balance sheet data and results of operations of the partnerships 
that previously owned 14 of the properties and of the management and leasing 
operations of the Predecessor which were contributed to the Company.  The 
Predecessor is considered the predecessor entity to the Company and the 
combined financial statements are presented for comparative purposes.  The 
following discussion compares the activity for the year ended December 31, 
1996 to results of operations for 1995.  Also included is a comparison of the 
activities for the year ended December 31, 1995 to the results for the year 
ended December 31, 1994, which includes a summation of the Company's and the 
Predecessor's results of operations for 1994.  

    	This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying 
consolidated and combined financial statements and notes thereto.

    	On March 16, 1994 the Company acquired Crossroads Mall ("Crossroads-OK") 
located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and on July 21, 1994 the Company acquired 
Chesterfield Towne Center ("Chesterfield") in Richmond, Virginia.  Crossroads-
OK and Chesterfield are collectively referred to herein as the "1994 
Acquisition Centers".  In August, 1995, the Company acquired The Centre at 
Salisbury ("Salisbury") in Salisbury, Maryland, and in December, 1995 the 
Company acquired two malls, Capitola Mall ("Capitola"), in Capitola, 
California, and Queens Center ("Queens"), in Queens, New York.  These 
properties are known as the "1995 Acquisition Centers."  In January 1996, the 
Company acquired Villa Marina Marketplace ("Villa Marina"), Valley View Mall 
("Valley View") in Dallas, Texas was acquired in October 1996 and Rimrock Mall 
("Rimrock") in Billings, Montana and Vintage Faire Mall ("Vintage Faire") in 
Modesto, California were acquired in November 1996.  In December 1996 the 
Company acquired Huntington Center ("Huntington") in Huntington Beach, 
California, Buenaventura Mall ("Buenaventura") in Ventura, California, and 
Fresno Fashion Fair ("Fresno") in Fresno, California.  These properties are 
known as the "1996 Acquisition Centers."  The financial statements include the 
results of the acquired properties from their acquisition dates.  As a result, 
many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred 
due to the addition of these properties to the Company's portfolio during 
1996, 1995 and 1994.  Many factors, such as availability and cost of capital, 
overall debt to market capitalization level, interest rates and availability 
of potential acquisition targets that meet the Company's criteria, impact the 
Company's ability to acquire additional properties.  Accordingly, management 
is uncertain as to whether during 1997 and future years  there will be similar 
acquisitions and corresponding increases in revenues, net income and Funds 
from Operations that occurred as a result of the 1996, 1995 and 1994 
acquisitions.

General Background and Performance Measurement, Continued
- ---------------------------------------------------------
     The bankruptcy and/or closure of retail stores, particularly Anchors, 
may reduce customer traffic and cash flow generated by a Center.  During 1995, 
Federated Department Stores, Inc. announced the closure of the Broadway Stores 
at Panorama and Huntington Center and Weinstock's at Parklane.  The Company 
acquired Weinstock's leasehold interest in 1996 and is negotiating with a 
replacement.  Federated is currently negotiating with another retailer to sell 
the former Panorama Broadway building.  The Huntington Center Broadway store 
is being demolished and replaced with a 21 screen theater complex.  All three 
stores remained closed through December 31, 1996.  The long-term closure of 
these or other stores could adversely affect the Company's performance.

    	In addition, the Company's success in the highly competitive real estate 
shopping center business depends upon many other factors, including general 
economic conditions, the ability of tenants to make rent payments, increases 
or decreases in operating expenses and interest rates, occupancy levels, 
changes in demographics, competition from other centers and forms of retailing 
and the ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or 
termination of leases.

Assets and Liabilities
- ----------------------
    	Total assets increased to $1,187,753,000 at December 31, 1996 compared 
to $763,398,000 at December 31, 1995 and $485,903,000 at December 31, 1994.  
During that same period, total liabilities increased from $326,588,000 in 1994 
to $509,313,000 in 1995 to $767,266,000 in 1996.  These changes were primarily 
as a result of the 1996 and 1995 common stock offerings, the purchase of the 
1996 Acquisition Centers and 1995 Acquisition Centers and various refinancing 
and debt reduction transactions described below.

A.  Equity Offering
      -------------------
    	The Company had an equity offering in November, 1996 in which 5,750,000 
shares were sold, raising $122.2 million of net equity, after costs of the 
offering.  The use of those proceeds and timing are summarized below:

B.  Acquisitions
    ----------------
    	On January 25, 1996, Villa Marina, a 447,684 square foot 
entertainment/community center was acquired.  The purchase price was $80 
million and included the assumption of debt of $22.5 million.  

    	On October 21, 1996 Valley View Mall, a 1.5 million square foot super 
regional mall in Dallas, Texas was acquired.  The purchase price was $87.5 
million.  Concurrent with the acquisition the Company placed $60 million of 
debt on the property at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.50%.  The Company has 
the option of converting this debt to fixed rate debt at any time prior to 
October 1, 1997.

    	On November 27, 1996, the Company purchased Rimrock and Vintage Faire.  
The total purchase price was $118.2 million which included assumption of $88.4 
million of debt which bears interest at an average fixed rate of 7.7%.

    	On December 18, 1996, the Company acquired Huntington, Buenaventura and 
Fresno.  The combined purchase price was $128.9 million and included 
assumption of mortgage debt of $38.0 million and $3.8 million of other 
liabilities.

C.  Refinancings and Debt Reductions
    ------------------------------------

   	On April 1, 1996 the mortgage debt on Crossroads-OK, Greentree Mall, and 
the Centre at Salisbury was refinanced.  The total indebtedness was increased 
to $117 million, from $88 million, and the average interest rate was fixed at 
7.2%.

<PAGE>
C.  Refinancings and Debt Reductions, Continued:
      ------------------------------------------------
     On September 30, 1996 the $65.1 million mortgage loan at Queens Center 
was refinanced.  The interest rate was reduced from LIBOR plus 1.10% to LIBOR 
plus 0.45%.  

     On December 23, 1996 the Villa Marina Marketplace mortgage debt of $22 
million was paid off.  

     There was a $60 million loan placed on Valley View Mall concurrent with 
its acquisition.  The interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.50% and the loan matures 
in October 1997, but the Company can convert the loan into a fixed rate loan 
that matures in October 2006.  

     Concurrent with the acquisition of Buenaventura Mall, Fresno Fashion 
Fair and Huntington Center, a $57 million unsecured loan was obtained.  The 
loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.625%.

Results of Operations 
- ---------------------
   Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 1996 and 1995
   ----------------------------------------------------
    	Revenues
     --------
     Minimum and percentage rents increased by 42% to $105.2 million 
from $74.1 million.  Approximately $19.0 million of the increase 
resulted from the 1995 Acquisition Centers and $13.2 million resulted 
from the 1996 Acquisition Centers.  These increases were partially 
offset by declining rents of $1.1 million at Parklane Mall which was 
adversely impacted by an anchor closure in 1996.  

     Tenant recoveries increased to $47.7 million in 1996 from $27 
million in 1995.  The 1996 and 1995 Acquisition Centers caused $19.3 
million of this increase.  Approximately $1.1 million of the increase 
was due to higher recoverable expenses in 1996 compared to 1995.

     Other income increased to $2.2 million in 1996 from $1.4 million 
in 1995.  Approximately $1.2 million of the increase related to the 1996 
and 1995 Acquisition Centers.  This increase was partially offset by 
lower interest income of $0.3 million in 1996 compared to 1995.


     	Expenses
      --------
      Shopping center expenses increased to $50.8 million in 1996 
compared to $31.6 million in 1995.  Approximately $18.7 million of the 
increase resulted from the 1996 and 1995 Acquisition Centers. The other 
centers had a net increase of $0.5 million in shopping center expenses 
of which approximately $1.1 million was for increased property taxes, 
$0.5 million of increased bad debt expense, offset by a reduction in 
ground rent expense of $1.3 million which resulted from the October, 
1995 acquisition of land at Crossroads Mall-Boulder which had previously 
been leased.  

      General and administrative expenses increased to $2.4 million in 
1996 from $2.0 million in 1995 primarily due to increased professional 
fee expense.

    	Interest Expense
     ----------------
     Interest expense increased to $42.4 million in 1996 from $25.5 
million in 1995. Interest expense attributable to County East Mall 
decreased $1.2 million in 1996 due to the payoff of that debt on 
December 31, 1995, also, there was a decrease of $1.3 million at 
Crossroads Mall-Boulder due to a December 1995 refinancing at a 
substantially lower interest rate.  These reductions partially offset 
the increase of $19.1 million from the 1995 and 1996 Acquisition 
Centers.

     	Depreciation and Amortization
      -----------------------------
      Depreciation increased to $32.6 million from $25.7 million in 
1995. An increase of approximately $7.6 million  related to the 1995 and 
1996 Acquisition Centers. This increase was offset by a decrease of 
approximately $1.4 million in amortization of financial instruments in 
1996 which resulted from several financial instruments becoming fully 
amortized in 1995.  

     	Minority Interest 
      -----------------
      The minority interest represents the 36.7% weighted average 
interest of the Operating Partnership that is not owned by the Company 
during 1996.

     Gain (Loss) From Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Management Companies
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     The gain from unconsolidated joint ventures and the management 
companies was $3.3 million for 1996, essentially the same as 1995.

     	Extraordinary Loss on Early Retirement of Debt
      ----------------------------------------------
      In connection with the sale of an interest rate cap, the Company 
wrote off unamortized financing costs of $0.3 million in 1996.  In 1995 
the Company wrote off  $1.3 million of loan costs  concurrent with the 
1995 refinancing of Lakewood Mall.

     	Net Income
      ----------
      As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $18.9 
million in 1996 from $11.3 million in 1995.

     	Operating Activities
      -------------------

      Cash flow from operations increased to $80.4 million compared to 
$48.2 million in 1995.  The increase resulted from the factors discussed 
above, primarily the impact of the 1995 and 1996 Acquisition Centers.

     	Investing Activities
      --------------------
      Cash flow used in investing activities was $296.6 million in 
1996 compared to a reduction of $88.4 million in 1995.  The change 
resulted primarily from the seven acquisitions completed in 1996 
compared to three acquisitions in 1995.

     	Financing Activities
      --------------------
      Cash flow from financing activities increased to $216.3 million 
in 1996 compared to $52.0 million in 1995.  The increase resulted from 
more mortgage financing done in 1996, primarily to fund the 1996 
acquisitions.

     	EBITDA and Funds From Operations
      --------------------------------
      Due primarily to the factors mentioned above, EBITDA increased 
48%, to $101.9 million in 1996 from $68.9 million in 1995 and Funds From 
Operations increased 39%, to $62.4 million, from $44.9 million in 1995.

    Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 1995 and 1994
    ----------------------------------------------------
	     Revenues
      --------
      Minimum and percentage rents increased by 17.2% from $63,188,000 
in 1994 to $74,067,000 in 1995.  The 1995 Acquisition Centers accounted 
for approximately $3,407,000 of this increase and 1994 Acquisition 
Centers accounted for $6,128,000 of the increase.  The primary reason 
for the balance of the increase was contractual rent increases in 
existing leases, and replacement of expiring leases with renewal leases 
at higher minimum rents.  

      Tenant recoveries increased by $5,338,000 to $26,961,000 for the 
year ended December 31, 1995, compared to the same period of 1994.  The 
1995 Acquisition Centers accounted for $1,293,000 of this increase in 
recoveries and the 1994 Acquisition Centers accounted for $3,494,000.  
The balance of the increase resulted primarily from increased 
recoverable expenses at the other properties.

      Management fee income was $528,000 for the period from January 
1, 1994 through March 15, 1994.   Prior to the IPO the Management 
Companies were consolidated with the Predecessor.  Subsequent to the 
IPO, the Management Companies are accounted for on the equity method and 
included in income from unconsolidated joint ventures and management 
companies.

      Other income increased from $682,000 in 1994 to $1,441,000 in 
1995.  This increase was due almost entirely to the temporary investment 
of the proceeds of a common stock offering into interest bearing 
investments until their ultimate use for debt repayment, acquisitions or 
other corporate purposes.

     	Expenses
      --------
      Shopping center expenses increased by $4,113,000 to $31,580,000 
for 1995.  An increase of $2,989,000 was due to the 1994 Acquisition 
Centers and $1,211,000 was due to the 1995 Acquisition Centers. The 
increase due to the Acquisition Centers was partially offset by reduced 
expense of $327,000 due to the purchase in October 1995 of a parcel of 
land at Crossroads Mall-Boulder which had previously been ground leased.  
In addition, real estate taxes, excluding the 1994 and 1995 Acquisition 
Centers, increased by $277,000 due to reassessments.  There were no 
management and leasing expenses in 1995 compared to $557,000 for 1994.  
This decrease is a result of the Management Companies being accounted 
for on the equity method after March 16, 1994.   General and 
administrative expenses of the Company were $2,011,000 compared to 
$1,545,000 during 1994.  This difference was primarily due to the 
Company being operational for only nine and one-half months in 1994.

     Interest Expense
      ----------------
     Interest expense increased by 14.8% from $22,237,000 for the 
twelve months ended December 31, 1994 to $25,531,000 for 1995. This was 
partially due to interest expense of $3,591,000 for the 1994 Acquisition 
Centers and $710,000 for the 1995 Acquisition Centers.  There was a 
reduction in same center interest expense in 1995 primarily due to the 
net reduction of approximately $117,100,000 of debt in March, 1994 
subsequent to the IPO.  During 1995, there was a full year of benefit 
from those reductions.

     	Depreciation and Amortization
      -----------------------------
      Depreciation increased by $3,280,000 to $25,749,000 for the 
twelve months ended December 31, 1996. The 1995 Acquisition Centers 
accounted for $717,000 of the difference and the Acquisition Centers 
that were purchased in 1994, but depreciated for a full year in 1995, 
accounted for $1,745,000. Also contributing to this increase was 
$515,000 related to additional depreciation of the 1994 acquisition cost 
of partnership interests.

     	Minority Interest In Operating Partnership
      ------------------------------------------
      The minority interest in the Operating Partnership represents 
the 42% weighted average interest in the Operating Partnership that is 
not owned by the Company at December 31, 1995.  

                         24

     	Gain (Loss) From Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Management Companies
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      The gain from unconsolidated joint ventures and the management 
companies increased to $3,250,000 for 1995 compared to $2,784,000 for 
1994.  This increase was primarily due to net income at Broadway Plaza 
increasing by $1,341,000 largely resulting from the addition of 15,000 
square feet of space which was completed during 1994 and reduction of 
the interest expense due to a debt reduction in March, 1994.  The 
Company owns a 50% joint venture interest in  Broadway Plaza.

     	Extraordinary Loss on Early Retirement of Debt
      ----------------------------------------------
      In connection with the 1995 refinancing of mortgage debt at 
Lakewood Mall, the Company wrote off unamortized financing costs of 
$1,299,000 associated with the retired debt of.

     	Net Income
      ----------
      As a result of the foregoing, net income increased by $3,565,000 
in 1995 compared to 1994.

     	Operating Activities
      --------------------

      Cash flow from operations was $44,936,000 in 1995, a 32.5% 
increase over 1994, primarily due to the factors mentioned above. 

     	Investing Activities
      --------------------
      Cash was utilized in investing activities totaling ($88,413,000) 
in 1995 compared to ($137,637,000) in 1994.  In 1994, cash flow was 
reduced by investing activities, primarily the acquisition of property 
and partnership interests concurrent with the IPO and the acquisition of 
Chesterfield.  Also contributing to the decrease was $27,799,000 of 
contributions to joint ventures which was primarily used to pay down 
debt at the joint ventures.  During 1995, the decrease in cash flow due 
to investing activities related primarily to cash expended for the 1995 
Acquisition Centers.

     	Financing Activities
      --------------------
      Financing activities reflected net cash flow of $51,973,000 in 
1995, compared to $99,584,000 in 1994.  This was primarily the result of 
the IPO in 1994 compared to the equity offering and refinancings in 
1995.

     	EBITDA and Funds From Operations
      --------------------------------
      Due to factors described above, EBITDA increased 22% to 
$68,878,000 from $56,452,000 in 1994.  Funds from Operations increased 
by 25.3% to $48,612,000 in 1995 from $38,790,000 in 1994.

     Liquidity and Capital Resources
     -------------------------------

     The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity 
requirements through cash generated from operations and working capital 
reserves.  The Company anticipates that revenues will continue to 
provide necessary funds for its operating expenses and debt service 
requirements, and to pay dividends to stockholders in accordance with 
REIT requirements.  The Company anticipates that cash generated from 
operations, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to fund capital 
expenditures which will not be reimbursed by tenants, other than non-
recurring capital expenditures.  Capital for major expenditures or 
redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained 
from equity or debt financings.

       The Company believes that it will have access to the capital 
necessary to expand its business in accordance with its strategies for 
growth and maximizing Funds from Operations.  The Company presently 
intends to obtain additional capital necessary to expand its business 
through a combination of additional equity offerings and debt 
financings.

      Liquidity and Capital Resources, Continued
      ------------------------------------------

      The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 
31, 1996 was $818.0 million (including its pro rata share of joint 
venture debt).  This equated to a debt to Total Market Capitalization 
(defined as total debt of the Operating Partnership, including its pro 
rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate market value of 
outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of OP Units 
into stock) rate of approximately 45.0% at year end.  Such debt consists 
primarily of conventional mortgages payable secured by individual 
properties.  See "Properties-Mortgage Debt" for a description of the 
Company's outstanding indebtedness.  In connection with $65.1 million of 
the Company's floating rate indebtedness, the Company has entered into 
interest rate protection agreements that limit the Company's exposure to 
increases in interest rates.  See "Properties-Mortgage Debt."

       The Company has filed a shelf registration statement, which is 
not yet effective, to sell securities.  The shelf registration is for a 
total of $500 million of common stock or common stock warrants.  

       The Company has a line of credit up to $50 million.  There was 
$12 million outstanding at December 31, 1996 and $0 outstanding at 
December 31, 1995.  

       At December 31, 1996 the Company had cash and cash equivalents 
available of $15.6 million.

     	Funds From Operations
      ---------------------
      The Company believes that the most significant measure of its 
performance is Funds from Operations ("FFO").  FFO is defined by The 
National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") to be:  
Net income, excluding gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and 
sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization and after 
adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.  Adjustments for 
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to 
reflect FFO on the same basis.  This is herein referred to as "FFO - 
Original Definition".  In May 1995, NAREIT issued a revised 
interpretation of FFO.  This revised definition of FFO ("FFO - New 
Definition") excludes the add back of non real estate depreciation and 
amortization.  Extraordinary items and significant non-recurring events 
are also excluded from FFO-New Definition.  FFO does not represent cash 
flow from operations, as defined by generally accepted accounting 
principles, and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund 
all cash flow needs.  The following reconciles net income to the FFO - 
Original Definition to the FFO - New Definition.

Inflation
- ---------

     In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact 
on the Company or the Predecessor because of a relatively low inflation 
rate.  Substantially all the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments 
periodically through the lease term.  These rent increases are either in 
fixed increments or based on increases in the Consumer Price Index.  In 
addition, many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years, which 
enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher 
base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing 
market rate.  Additionally, most of the leases require the tenants to pay 
their pro rata share of operating expenses.  This reduces the Company's 
exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from 
inflation.

                     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
                      ----------------------------------


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Macerich Company



We have audited the consolidated and combined financial statements and 
financial statement schedule of The Macerich Company and Macerich Predecessor 
Affiliates as listed in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K.  These financial 
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the 
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Macerich 
Company as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the consolidated and combined 
results of the Macerich Company's and Macerich Predecessor Affiliates' 
operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 
and for the period March 16, 1994 through December 31, 1994 and the period 
January 1, 1994 through March 15, 1994, respectively, in conformity with

             THE MACERICH COMPANY (THE "COMPANY") and
           MACERICH PREDECESSOR AFFILIATES (PREDECESSOR)

        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
            (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

1.	Organization And Basis Of Presentation: 
- --------------------------------------------
Macerich Predecessor Affiliates ("Predecessor"), represent 
entities owned by or affiliated with Macerich principals and their 
affiliates ("The Macerich Group") that were reorganized to combine The 
Macerich Group's interests in certain retail investment properties and 
property management, leasing and redevelopment businesses. The 
reorganization entailed a public offering of common stock in a newly 
formed Maryland corporation, The Macerich Company ("Company"), the 
proceeds of which were invested in the Macerich Partnership L.P. ("The 
Operating Partnership").    The Company commenced operations effective 
with the completion of the initial public offering (the "IPO") on March 
16, 1994.  The Operating Partnership holds ownership interests in the 
entities reflected herein as Predecessor for periods prior to March 16, 
1994.  These interests in the Predecessor were obtained in exchange for 
cash, an ownership interest in The Operating Partnership ("OP Units") 
and common stock of the Company.  OP Units not held by the Company can 
be exchanged, subject to certain restrictions, on a one-for-one basis, 
into the Company's common stock.

The Company, which was organized to qualify as a real estate 
investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Service Code of 
1986, as amended, as of December 31, 1996, owns approximately 68% of The 
Operating Partnership and is the sole general partner.  The 32% limited 
partnership interest of the Operating Partnership, not owned by the 
Company, is reflected in these financial statements as minority 
interest.  The average total number of OP Units outstanding in The 
Operating Partnership (including the units owned by the Company) was 
32,934,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996, 26,930,000 for the year 
ended December 31, 1995, and 25,645,000 for the period from March 16, 
1994 to December 31, 1994.

The property management, leasing and redevelopment of the 
Company's portfolio is provided by the Macerich Management Company and 
Macerich Property Management Company, California corporations (together 
referred to hereafter as "the Management Companies").  The non-voting 
preferred stock of the Management Companies is owned by The Operating 
Partnership, which provides The Operating Partnership the right to 
receive 95% of the distributable cash flow from the Management 
Companies.

Basis Of Presentation:
- ----------------------
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the 
accounts of the Company and the Operating Partnership.  The accompanying 
Predecessor financial statements are presented on a combined basis as 
the entities are predecessor businesses to the Company.  The properties 
which The Operating Partnership does not own a greater than 50% interest 
in, and the Management Companies, have been accounted for under the 
equity method of accounting. These entities are reflected on the 
Company's consolidated financial statements as investment in joint 
ventures and the Management Companies.  The Management Companies are 
combined with the financial statements of the Predecessor in the 
combined financial statements of the Predecessor.

The formation of the Company has been reflected as a 
reorganization of the predecessor business with the assets and 
liabilities reflected at the historical cost basis of the Predecessor, 
except for those properties for which monetary consideration was given 
to acquire interests previously held by outside joint venture partners, 
in which case the portion of the property so acquired has been adjusted 
to reflect the value of the consideration given.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been 
eliminated in the consolidated and combined financial statements.

2.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
- -------------------------------------------------
Cash And Cash Equivalents:
- -------------------------
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an 
original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash 
equivalents, for which cost approximates market.  Included in cash is 
restricted cash of $3,775 at December 31, 1996 and $750 at December 31, 
1995 which reflects cash restricted under terms of a loan agreement to 
be used for certain capital expenditures.

Revenues:
- --------
Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the terms of the related lease.  The difference between the amount 
of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is 
referred to as the "straight lining of rent adjustment."  Rental income 
was increased by $1,832 in 1996, $944 in 1995, $1,212 for the period 
from March 16, 1994 to December 31, 1994, and $94 for the period from 
January 1, 1994 to March 15, 1994 due to the straight lining of rent 
adjustment.  Percentage rents are recognized on an accrual basis.  
Recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes, insurance and other 
shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the 
period the applicable costs are incurred.
	
	The Management Companies provide property management, leasing, 
corporate, development and acquisitions services to affiliated and non-
affiliated shopping centers.  In consideration for these services, the 
Management Companies receive monthly management fees generally ranging 
from 1.5% to 5% of the gross monthly rental revenue of the properties 
managed.  

Management fees are recognized as revenue as they are earned in 
the combined financial statements of the Predecessor.

Property:
- --------
Costs related to the acquisition, development, construction and 
improvement of properties are capitalized. Interest costs are 
capitalized until construction is substantially complete.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations 
as incurred.  Realized gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or 
retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.

Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-
line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

		Tenant improvements             initial term of related lease
		Buildings and improvements                         5-40 years
		Equipment and furnishings                          5- 7 years

Deferred Charges:
	      ----------------
	Costs relating to financing of shopping center properties and 
obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term 
of the agreement.  The straight-line method is used to amortize all 
costs except financing, for which the effective interest method is used.  
The range of the terms of the agreements are as follows:

		Deferred lease costs                    2 - 15 years
		Deferred financing costs                1 - 15 years

2.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued:
- -----------------------------------------------------

Deferred Acquisition Liability:
- ------------------------------
	As part of the Company's total consideration to the seller of 
Capitola Mall, the Company will issue $5,000 of OP Units five years 
after the acquisition date.  The number of OP Units will be determined 
based on the Company's common stock price at that time.

Income Taxes:
- ------------
	The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  A REIT is generally not subject to 
income taxation on that portion of its income that qualifies as REIT 
taxable income as long as it distributes at least 95 percent of its 
taxable income to its stockholders and complies with other requirements.  
Accordingly, no provision has been made for income taxes in the 
consolidated financial statements. 

	On a tax basis, the distributions of $1.70 paid during 1996 
represented $1.14 of ordinary income and $0.56 of return of capital and 
the distributions of $1.66 per share during 1995 represented $1.00 of 
ordinary income and $0.66 return of capital.  During 1994 the 
distributions were $0.87 per share of which $0.70 was ordinary income 
and $0.17 was return of capital.

	Each partner is taxed individually on their share of partnership 
income or loss, and accordingly, no provision for federal and state 
income tax is provided for the Operating Partnership or Predecessor in 
the combined financial statements.

Reclassifications:
- -----------------
	Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1994 and 1995 
financial statements to conform to the 1996 financial statement 
presentation.

Accounting Pronouncements:
- -------------------------
	During 1995 the Financial Accounting Standard Board ("FAS") issued 
Statement of Accounting Standards No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment 
of Long-Lived Assets" and FAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation." The Company adopted these pronouncement in 1996 but the 
requirements of these statements did not have a significant impact on 
the Company's consolidated financial statements.  The effect of FAS 123 
is discussed in Footnote 12 and the effect of FAS 121 is discussed 
below.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
- -------------------------------
	In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") 
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, 
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived 
Assets to Be Disposed Of."  SFAS No 121 requires that long-lived assets 
and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  
Certain long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be 
disposed must be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
less cost to sell.  The Company adopted SFAS No.121 beginning in the 
first quarter of 1996 with no material impact to the Company's financial 
condition or results of operations.

2.	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued:
- ------------------------------------------------------
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
- -----------------------------------
	To meet the reporting requirement of FAS No. 107 "Disclosures 
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", the Company calculates the 
fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional 
information in the notes to financial statements when the fair value is 
different than the carrying value of those financial instruments.  When 
the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional 
disclosure is made.  The estimated fair value amounts have been 
determined by the Company using available market information and 
appropriate valuation methodologies.  However, considerable judgment is 
necessarily required in interpreting market data to develop the 
estimates of fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented herein 
are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could 
realize in a current market exchange.  The use of different market 
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect 
on the estimated fair value amounts.

	Interest rate cap agreements are purchased by the Company from 
third parties to hedge the risk of interest rate increases on some of 
the Company's variable rate debt.  The cost of these cap agreements is 
amortized over the life of the cap agreement on a straight line basis.  
Payments received as a result of the cap agreements are recorded as a 
reduction of interest expense.  The unamortized costs of the cap 
agreements are included in deferred charges.  The fair market value of 
these caps will vary with fluctuations in interest rates.  The Company 
is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these 
counter parties to the financial instruments, however, management does 
not anticipate nonperformance by the counter party.

Earnings Per Share:
- ------------------
	The computation of primary earnings per share is based on net 
income and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for 
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995.  The outstanding common 
stock options have less than a 3% dilutive effect on earnings per share 
and thus have not been included in the computation.  The effect of the 
Company stock option plan was calculated using the Treasury stock 
method.  The computation of fully diluted earnings per share is less 
than 3% dilutive and has not been presented.

Concentration of Risk:
- ----------------------
	Lakewood Mall generated 16.0% of total shopping center revenues in 
1996, 22.0% in 1995 and  25.6% in 1994.  Shopping center revenues at 
Crossroads Mall-Colorado accounted for 10.6% of total shopping center 
revenues in 1995 and 12.16% in 1994.  During 1995 Chesterfield accounted 
for 12.6% of total Shopping Center revenues.  Queens Center accounted 
for 13.8% of 1996 shopping center revenue.  No other Center generated 
more than 10% of shopping center revenues during 1996, 1995 or 1994.

	The Centers derived approximately 88.8% of their total rents for 
the year ended December 31, 1996 from Mall and Freestanding Stores.  No 
single retailer accounted for more than 6.5% of annual base rents of the 
Company as of December 31, 1996.  The Limited represented 6.3% of total 
minimum rents in place as of December 31, 1996 and Woolworth represented 
4.8% as of that date.  No other retailer represented more than 2.5% of 
total minimum rents as of December 31, 1996.


Management Estimates:
- ---------------------
	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ 
from those estimates.

3.	Investments In Joint Ventures and the Management Companies:
- -----------------------------------------------------------
	The following are the Company's investments in various real estate 
joint ventures which own regional retail shopping centers.  The 
Operating Partnership is a general partner in these joint ventures.  The 
Operating Partnership's interest in each joint venture as of December 
31, 1996 is as follows:

	North Valley Plaza Associates  	                      50%
 Panorama City Associates                             	50%      
 West Acres Development                               	19%      

	The Operating Partnership also owns the non-voting preferred stock 
of the Management Companies and is entitled to receive 95% of the 
distributable cash flow.

	Combined and condensed balance sheets and statement of operations 
are presented below for all unconsolidated joint ventures and the 
Management Companies, followed by information regarding The Operating 
Partnership's/ Predecessor's beneficial interest in operations.  
Beneficial interest is calculated based on the terms of the joint 
venture agreements and reflects 95% of the Management Companies.

6.  Mortgage Notes Payable, Continued:
- -------------------------------------
(a)		On August 15, 1995 the Company issued  $127,000 of collateralized 
floating rate notes (the "Notes").  The Notes bear interest at an 
average fixed rate of 7.20% and mature in July 2005.

The Note requires the Company to deposit all cash flow from the 
property operations with a trustee to meet its obligations under the 
Notes.  Cash in excess of the required amount, as defined, is 
released.  Included in cash and cash equivalents is $750 of 
restricted cash deposited with the trustee at December 31, 1995 and 
$750 at December 31, 1996.

(b)		This loan was refinanced on December 21, 1995.  The loan amount 
remained the same.  The interest rate was reduced to 7.08%.

(c)		This note was issued at a discount.  The discount is being 
amortized over the life of the loan using the effective 
interest method.  At December 31, 1996 and 1995 the unamortized 
discount was $463 and $496, respectively.

(d)  		This loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.45%.  There is an 
interest rate protection agreement in place on the first $10.2 
million of this debt with a LIBOR ceiling of 5.88% through maturity 
with the remaining principal having an interest rate cap with a LIBOR 
ceiling at 7.07% through 1997 and 7.7% thereafter.

(e)  The $55,800 loan bears interest at LIBOR plus .90%.  This loan was 
paid off on September 30, 1996.  

The $10,200 loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.22%.  This loan was 
paid off on September 30, 1996.

     
(f)		This represents the monthly payment of principal and interest.

(g)	      This loan is cross collateralized by Green Tree Mall and 
Crossroads Mall Oklahoma and as of April 14, 1996 also included 
Salisbury.  

(h)	      Represents the unamortized cost of interest rate arrangements 
at County East Mall and Crossroads Mall.  The estimated  market value 
of these arrangements is $886 at December 31, 1995 and $0 at December 
31, 1996.

(i)	      This amount represents the monthly payment of principal and 
interest.  In addition, contingent interest, as defined in the loan 
agreement, may be due to the extent that 35% of the amount by which 
the property's gross receipts (as defined in the loan agreement) 
exceeds a base amount specified therein.  Contingent interest expense 
recognized by the Company was $76 for the period from July 21, 1994 
(the date of acquisition of Chesterfield Towne Center) to December 
31, 1994, $184 for the year ended December 31, 1995 and $399 for 
1996.  As of January 1, 1997 all these loans were consolidated into a 
new loan of $66.2 million at an interest rate of 9.1%.

This amount bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50% and matures on October 
21, 1997, however, at any time prior to maturity, the Company can 
convert this into a fixed rate loan maturing in October 2006.

(j)	      Interest only is payable through March 1996.  Thereafter 
monthly payments total $187 until maturity, at which time the balance 
is due in full.

(k)  This loan was combined with the Greentree/Crossroads-OK loan on April 
14, 1996.

(l)  This loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50% (7.00% at December 31, 
1996).  At any time prior to October 21, 1997 this loan can be 
converted to a fixed rate loan at a rate of 1.25% over the rate on a 
Treasury Note of  a duration equal to the maturity of the loan.

     Perchloroethylene (PCE) has been detected in soil and groundwater in the 
vicinity of a dry cleaning establishment at North Valley Plaza.  The 
California Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) has advised the 
Company that very low levels of Dichlorethylene (1,2,DCE) a degradation 
byproduct of PCE, have been detected in a water well located 1/4 mile west 
from the dry cleaners, and that the dry cleaning facility may have 
contributed to the introduction of 1,2 DCE into the water well.  According 
to DTSC, the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for 1,2DCE which is permitted 
in drinking water is 6 parts per billion (ppb); and the 1,2DCE was detected 
in the water well at 1.2 ppb, which is below the MCL.  The Company has 
retained an environmental consultant and has initiated extensive testing of 
the site, although the extent of the impacted soil and groundwater has not 
been fully defined.  Remediation is scheduled to begin in the first half of 
1997. The joint venture that owns that property had a $685 reserve at 
December 31, 1996.  In addition, $155  has already been incurred, to cover 
professional fees and testing costs.   The Company intends to look to the 
responsible parties and insurers for cost recovery.

10.	Commitments and Contingencies, Continued:
   -----------------------------------------
     Toluene, a petroleum constituent, was detected in a groundwater 
dewatering system at the Queens Center.  The source of the toluene is 
currently unknown, but it is possible that an adjacent Sunoco service 
station has caused or contributed to the problem.  It is also possible that 
the toluene remains from previous service station operations which occurred 
on site prior to the development of the site into its current use in the 
early 1970s.  Toluene was detected at levels of 410 and 160 parts per 
billion (ppb) in samples taken from the tank in October, 1995 and February, 
1996, respectively.   Additional samples were taken in May and December of 
1996, with results of .63 ppb and "non-detect" for the May sampling event 
and 16.2 ppb and 25.2 ppb for the December sampling event.  The maximum 
containment level (MCL) for toluene in drinking water is 150 ppb.  Although 
the Company believes that no remediation will be required, it has set up a 
$150 reserve to cover professional fees and testing costs.  The Company 
intends to look to the responsible parties and insurers if remediation is 
required.

      Dry cleaning chemicals, including PCE were detected in soil and 
groundwater in the vicinity of a dry cleaning establishment at Villa Marina 
Marketplace.  The previous owner of the property has reported the release 
to the local government authorities and has agreed to fully assess and 
remediate the site to the extent required by those authorities.  Although 
the Company believes that it will not be required to participate in 
assessment or remediation activities, it has set up a $150 reserve ($20 of 
which has already been incurred) to cover professional and legal fees.

     Dry cleaning chemicals including PCE were detected in soil and 
groundwater in the vicinity of a former dry cleaning establishment at 
Huntington Center.  The release has been reported to the local government 
authorities.  The Company estimates, based on the data currently available, 
that costs for assessment, remediation and legal services will not exceed 
$500.  Consequently, a $500 reserve was established at the time of the 
acquisition to cover professional and legal fees.  The Company intends to 
look to responsible parties and insurers for cost recovery.

     	The Company acquired Fresno Fashion Fair in December, 1996.  Asbestos 
has been detected in structural fireproofing throughout much of the Mall.  
Recent testing data conducted by a professional environmental consulting 
firms indicates that the fireproofing is largely inaccessible to building 
occupants and is well adhered to the structural members.  Additionally, 
airborne concentrations of asbestos are well within OSHA's permissible 
exposure limit (PEL) of .1 fcc.  The Company intends to abate asbestos 
fireproofing as tenant spaces become vacant. The accounting for this 
acquisition includes a reserve of $3.3 million to cover future removal of 
this asbestos, as necessary.

 11.	Profit Sharing Plan:
      -------------------
    	The Management Companies and the Company have a retirement profit 
sharing plan that was established in 1984 covering substantially all of 
their eligible employees.  The plan is qualified in accordance with section 
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Effective January 1, 1995 this plan 
was modified to include a 401(k) plan whereby employees can elect to defer 
compensation subject to Internal Revenue Service withholding rules.  
Contributions by the Management Companies are made at the discretion of the 
Board of Directors and are based upon a specified percentage of employee 
compensation.  The Management Companies and the Company contributed $350, 
$348 and $325 to the plan in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.


12.	Stock Option Plan:
      ------------------
    	The Company has established stock option plans for the purpose of 
attracting and retaining executive officers, directors and key employees.  
The Company has issued options to employees to purchase 1,512,334 shares of 
the Company under the stock incentive plan.  The term of these options is 
ten years from the grant date.  These options generally vest 33 1/3% per 
year over three years and were issued and are exercisable at the market 
value of the common stock at the grant date.

12.	Stock Option Plan, Continued

    	In addition, the Company has established a plan for non employee 
directors. A total of 27,500 options were outstanding at December 31, 1996, 
22,500 were exercisable.  The non employee directors options have a term of 
ten years from the grant date and vest six months after grant.

    	Also, under the employees stock incentive plan 41,238 shares of 
restricted stock have been issued to executives.  These awards are granted 
based on certain performance criteria for the Company.  The restricted 
stock vests over 5 years and the compensation expense related to these 
grants is reflected over the vesting period on a straight line basis.  As 
of December 31, 1996 none of the restricted stock grants had vested.  A 
total of 41,238 shares were issued during 1996 at a weighted average price 
of $20.70 per share and 0 shares were issued during 1995.

    	An additional 412,762 shares have been reserved for issuance under the 
stock incentive plan.  The plan allow for granting options or restricted 
stock at market value.

    	The weighted average exercise price for options granted in 1994 is 
$19.02, for 1995 is $20.25 and for 1996 is $21.65.  

    	The weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding 
at December 31, 1996 is 7.9 years and the weighed average remaining 
contractual life for options exercisable at December 31, 1996 is 7.6 years.

    	The Company records options granted using Accounting Principles Board 
(APB) opinion Number 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and 
Related Interpretations.  Accordingly, no compensation expense is 
recognized on the date the options are granted.  If the Company had 
recorded compensation expense using the methodology prescribed in Financial 
Accounting Standards Number 123, the Company's net income would have been 
reduced by approximately $56 or $0.00 per share for the year ended December 
31, 1996 and $160 or $0.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 1995.
