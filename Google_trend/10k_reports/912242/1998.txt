ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
    GENERAL
 
    The Macerich Company (the "Company") is involved in the acquisition,
ownership, redevelopment, management and leasing of regional and community
shopping centers located throughout the United States. The Company is the sole
general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, The
Macerich Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating
Partnership"). The Operating Partnership owns or has an ownership interest in 38
regional shopping centers and four community centers aggregating approximately
33.1 million square feet of gross leasable area. These 42 regional and community
shopping centers are referred to hereinafter as the "Centers", unless the
context otherwise requires. The Company is a self-administered and self-managed
real estate investment trust ("REIT") and conducts all of its operations through
the Operating Partnership and the Company's three management companies, Macerich
Property Management Company, a California corporation, Macerich Manhattan
Management Company, a California corporation, and Macerich Management Company, a
California corporation (collectively, the "Management Companies").
 
    The Company was organized as a Maryland corporation in September 1993 to
continue and expand the shopping center operations of Mace Siegel, Arthur M.
Coppola, Dana K. Anderson and Edward C. Coppola and certain of their business
associates.
 
    All references to the Company in this 10-K include the Company, those
entities owned or controlled by the Company and predecessors of the Company,
unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
    DEBT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS
 
    On February 5, 1997 the Company filed a new shelf registration statement for
$500 million worth of securities (including the remaining $16 million under the
former shelf) to be issued at a later date. The new shelf was declared effective
on December 8, 1997.
 
    On June 27, 1997, the Company sold $150 million of convertible subordinated
debentures (the "Debentures") due 2002. In July 1997, an additional $11.4
million of the Debentures were sold. The net proceeds from the sale of the
Debentures of $157.4 million were used by the Company primarily to repay
floating rate debt and for general corporate purposes. On December 22, 1997, the
Company filed a shelf registration statement for $119.4 million of the
convertible debentures that were issued during June and July of 1997. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations--Convertible Debt Offering and Recent Developments."
 
    On February 25, 1998, the Company issued $100 million of convertible
preferred shares in a private placement. During February 1998, the Company
issued 2.9 million common shares ($79.6 million of total proceeds) from the
shelf registration. The proceeds from the sale of the preferred shares and the
common shares were used to acquire the ERE Yarmouth portfolio. See "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations--Convertible Debt Offering and Recent Developments."

    On February 27, 1998, the Company acquired, through a 50/50 joint venture
with an affiliate of Simon DeBartolo Group, Inc., a portfolio of twelve regional
malls ("the ERE Yarmouth portfolio"). The properties in the portfolio comprise
10.7 million square feet and are located in eight states. The total purchase
price was $974.5 million, which included the assumption of $485 million of debt.
 
THE SHOPPING CENTER INDUSTRY
 
    GENERAL
 
    There are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated
primarily based on size and marketing strategy. Retail shopping centers
generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of gross leasable area
("GLA"), are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores
("Anchors") and are referred to as "Regional Shopping Centers" or "Malls".
Regional Shopping Centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail
stores ("Mall Stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers
typically located along corridors connecting the Anchors. Community Shopping
Centers, also referred to as "strip centers," are retail shopping centers that
are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically
anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug
stores. Community Shopping Centers typically contain 100,000 square feet to
400,000 square feet of GLA. In addition, freestanding retail stores are located
along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("Freestanding Stores"). Anchors,
Mall and Freestanding Stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for
the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and
other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center.
 
    REGIONAL SHOPPING CENTERS
 
    A Regional Shopping Center draws from its trade area by offering a variety
of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, generally in
an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. Regional
Shopping Centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities
and often serve as the town center and the preferred gathering place for
community, charity and promotional events.
 
    The Company focuses on the acquisition and redevelopment of Regional
Shopping Centers. Regional Shopping Centers have generally provided owners with
relatively stable growth in income despite the cyclical nature of the retail
business. This stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the
typical dominance of Regional Shopping Centers in their trade areas. Regional
Shopping Centers are difficult to develop because of the significant barriers to
entry, including the limited availability of capital and suitable
 
                                       2
<PAGE>
development sites, the presence of existing Regional Shopping Centers in most
markets, a limited number of Anchors, and the associated development costs and
risks. Consequently, the Company believes that few new Regional Shopping Centers
will be built in the next five years. However, many of the market, financing and
economic risks typically associated with the development of new Regional
Shopping Centers can be mitigated by acquiring and redeveloping an existing
Regional Shopping Center. Furthermore, the value of Regional Shopping Centers
can be significantly enhanced through redevelopment, renovation and expansion.
 
    Regional Shopping Centers have different strategies with regard to price,
merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs
of their trade areas. Anchor tenants are located along common areas in a
configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the Mall
Stores. Mall GLA, which generally refers to gross leasable area contiguous to
the Anchors for tenants other than Anchors, is leased to a wide variety of
smaller retailers. Mall stores typically account for the bulk of the revenues of
a Regional Shopping Center.
 
    Although a variety of retail formats compete for consumer purchases, the
Company believes that Regional Shopping Centers will continue to be a preferred
shopping destination. The combination of a climate controlled shopping
environment and a diverse tenant mix has resulted in Regional Shopping Centers
generating higher tenant sales than are generally achieved at smaller retail
formats. Further, the Company believes that department stores located in
Regional Shopping Centers will continue to provide a full range of current
fashion merchandise at a limited number of locations in any one market, allowing
them to command the largest geographical trade area of any retail format.
 
    COMMUNITY SHOPPING CENTERS
 
    Community Shopping Centers are designed to attract local and neighborhood
customers and are typically open air shopping centers, with one or more
supermarkets, drugstores or discount department stores. National retailers such
as Kids-R-Us at Bristol Shopping Center, Toys-R-Us at Boulder Plaza, and The
Gap, Victoria's Secret and Limited Express at Villa Marina, provide the
Company's Community Shopping Centers with the opportunity to draw from a much
larger trade area than a typical supermarket or drugstore anchored Community
Shopping Center.
 
BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY
 
    MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING PHILOSOPHY
 
    The Company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized
skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable
operations. For this reason, the Company has developed a fully integrated real
estate organization with in-house acquisition, redevelopment, property
management, leasing, finance, construction, marketing, legal and accounting
expertise. In addition, the Company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized
property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals.
The Company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant
mix and drawing power of each Center as well as the ability to quickly respond
to changing competitive conditions of the Center's trade area.
 
    PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND LEASING.  The Company believes that on-site property
managers can most effectively operate the Centers. Each Center's property
manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and
security functions at the Center. Property managers focus special attention on
controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the Centers,
and seek to develop strong relationships with and to be responsive to the needs
of retailers.
 
    The Company believes strongly in decentralized leasing and accordingly, most
of its leasing managers are located on-site to better understand the market and
the community in which a Center is located. Leasing managers are charged with
more than the responsibility of leasing space; they continually assess
 
                                       3
<PAGE>
and fine tune each Center's tenant mix, identify and replace underperforming
tenants and seek to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations.
 
    ACQUISITIONS.  Since its initial public offering ("IPO"), the Company has
acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. These acquisitions were
identified and consummated by the Company's staff of acquisition professionals
who are strategically located in Santa Monica, Dallas, Denver and Atlanta. The
Company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and
maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions
and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise. The Company focuses on
assets that are or can be dominant in their trade area, have a franchise and
where there is intrinsic value.
 
    The Company made the following acquisitions in 1996: Villa Marina
Marketplace ("Villa Marina") on January 25, 1996; Valley View Center on October
21, 1996; Vintage Faire Mall and Rimrock Mall on November 27, 1996; and
Buenaventura Mall, Fresno Fashion Fair and Huntington Center on December 18,
1996. Together these properties are referred to herein as the "1996 Acquisition
Centers".
 
    The Company made the following acquisitions in 1997: South Towne Center in
Sandy, Utah on March 27, 1997; Stonewood Mall in Downey, California on August 6,
1997; Manhattan Village in Manhattan Beach, California on August 19, 1997 in a
joint venture in which the Company owns a 10% interest; The Citadel in Colorado
Springs, Colorado on December 19, 1997 and Great Falls Marketplace in Great
Falls, Montana on December 31, 1997. Together these properties are referred to
herein as the "1997 Acquisition Centers".
 
    On February 27, 1998, the Company, along with a joint venture partner,
acquired the ERE Yarmouth portfolio of 12 regional malls totaling 10.7 million
square feet. The Company is a 50% owner of this portfolio.
 
    REDEVELOPMENT.  One of the major components of the Company's growth strategy
is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. For this reason, the Company
has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility
for identifying redevelopment opportunities that will result in enhanced
long-term financial returns and market position for the Centers. The
redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects
in addition to obtaining required governmental and Anchor approvals.
 
    THE CENTERS.  As of February 27, 1998, the Centers consist of 38 Regional
Shopping Centers and four Community Shopping Centers aggregating approximately
33.1 million square feet of GLA. 38 of the 42 Centers contain more than 400,000
square feet of GLA. The 38 Regional Shopping Centers in the Company's portfolio
average approximately 846,000 square feet of GLA and range in size from 1.8
million square feet of GLA at Lakewood Mall to 369,742 square feet of GLA at
Panorama Mall. The Company's four Community Shopping Centers, Boulder Plaza,
Villa Marina Marketplace, Bristol Shopping Center and Great Falls Marketplace,
have an average of 229,000 square feet of GLA. The 42 Centers presently include
149 Anchors totaling approximately 18.3 million square feet of GLA and
approximately 4,540 Mall and Freestanding Stores totaling approximately 14.8
million square feet of GLA.
 
    Total revenues increased from $155 million in 1996 to $221 million in 1997
primarily due to acquisitions. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Lakewood Mall generated 10.5% of
total shopping center revenues in 1997, 16.0% in 1996 and 22.0% in 1995. Queens
Center accounted for 13.8% of 1996 shopping center revenue. Shopping center
revenues at Crossroads Mall-Colorado accounted for 10.6% of total shopping
center revenues in 1995. During 1995 Chesterfield accounted for 12.6% of total
Shopping Center revenues. No other Center generated more than 10% of shopping
center revenues during 1997, 1996 or 1995.

    COST OF OCCUPANCY
 
    The Company's management believes that in order to maximize the Company's
operating cash flow, the Centers' Mall Store tenants must be able to operate
profitably. A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of
occupancy. The following table summarizes occupancy costs for Mall Store tenants
in the Centers as a percentage of total Mall Store sales for the last three
years:

    COMPETITION
 
    The 38 Regional Shopping Centers are located in developed areas in middle to
upper income markets where there are relatively few other Regional Shopping
Centers. In addition, 37 of the 38 Regional Shopping Centers contain more than
400,000 square feet of GLA. The Company intends to consider additional expansion
and renovation projects to maintain and enhance the quality of the Centers and
their competitive position in their trade areas.
 
    There are numerous owners and developers of real estate that compete with
the Company in its trade areas. There are nine other publicly traded mall REITs,
any of which under certain circumstances, could compete against the Company for
an acquisition or an Anchor. This results in competition for both acquisition of
centers and for tenants to occupy space. The existence of competing shopping
centers could have a material impact on the Company's ability to lease space and
on the level of rent that can be achieved. There is also increasing competition
from other forms of retail, such as factory outlet centers, power centers,
discount shopping clubs, internet shopping services and home shopping networks
that could adversely affect the Company's revenues.
 
    MAJOR TENANTS
 
    The Centers derived approximately 89.5% of their total rents for the year
ended December 31, 1997 from Mall and Freestanding Stores. One retailer
accounted for approximately 7.6% of annual base rents of the Company, and no
other single retailer accounted for more than 4.6%, as of December 31, 1997.

    MALL AND FREESTANDING STORES
 
    Mall and Freestanding Store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent
comprised of a fixed base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on
sales. In some cases, tenants pay only a fixed minimum rent, and in some cases,
tenants pay only percentage rents. Most leases for Mall and Freestanding Stores
contain provisions that allow the Centers to recover their costs for maintenance
of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other
expenditures related to the operations of the Center.
 
    The Company uses tenant spaces 10,000 square feet and under for comparing
rental rate activity. Tenant space under 10,000 square feet in the portfolio at
December 31, 1997 comprises 75.3% of all Mall and Freestanding Store space. The
Company believes that to include space over 10,000 square feet would provide a
less meaningful comparison.
 
    When an existing lease expires, the Company is often able to enter into a
new lease with a higher base rent component. The average base rent for new Mall
and Freestanding Store leases, 10,000 square feet or under, commencing during
1997 was $27.58 per square foot, or 13.6% higher than the average base rent for
all Mall and Freestanding Stores (10,000 square feet or under) at December 31,
1997 of $24.27 per square foot.
 
    The following table sets forth for the Centers the average base rent per
square foot of Mall and Freestanding GLA, for tenants 10,000 square feet and
under, as of December 31 for each of the past three years.

    1996 Acquisition Centers and the average for 1997 excludes the 1997
    Acquisition Centers.
 
    BANKRUPTCY AND CLOSURE OF RETAIL STORES
 
    The bankruptcy and/or closure of an Anchor, or its sale to a less desirable
retailer, could adversely affect customer traffic in a Center and thereby reduce
the income generated by that Center. Furthermore, the closing of an Anchor
could, under certain circumstances, allow certain other Anchors or other tenants
to terminate their leases or cease operating their stores at the Center or
otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the Center. During 1997, Montgomery Ward
filed for bankruptcy. The Company has Montgomery Ward as an anchor in eleven of
its centers. If Montgomery Ward ceases to operate it could have an adverse
effect on a center.
 
    Retail stores at the Centers other than Anchors may also seek the protection
of the bankruptcy laws, which could result in the termination of such tenants'
leases and thus cause a reduction in the cash flow generated by the Centers.
Although no single retailer accounts for greater than 7.6% of total rents, the
bankruptcy and subsequent closure of stores could create a decrease in occupancy
levels, reduced rental income or otherwise adversely affect the Centers.
 
    LEASE EXPIRATIONS
 
    The following table shows scheduled lease expirations (for Centers owned as

ANCHORS
 
    Anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's
identification with Regional Shopping Centers. Anchors are generally department
stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. Although the
Centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from Anchors than
from Mall and Freestanding Stores, strong Anchors play an important part in
maintaining customer traffic and making the Centers desirable locations for Mall
and Freestanding Store tenants.
 
    Anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases
adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates
that are typically lower than the rents charged to tenants of Mall and
Freestanding Stores. Each Anchor which owns its own store, and certain Anchors
which lease their stores, enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the
owner of the Center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial
construction and future expansion.
 
    Anchors accounted for approximately 10.5% of the Company's total rent for
the year ended December 31, 1997.

(1) In February, 1998 the Company bought out the Mervyn's lease at Crossroads
    Mall in Boulder, Colorado and then the Company sold the former Mervyn's
    building to Sears. Sears is planning to renovate the former Mervyn's store
    and to open in the fall, 1998. The Company is currently negotiating with
    replacement tenants for the old Sears location.
 
(2) Wal-Mart purchased the former Broadway Store at Panorama Mall from Federated
    in March 1997 which had been vacant since February 1996. Wal-Mart commenced
    retrofit of the facility in October 1997 and plans to open its new facility
    in June 1998.
 
(3) J.C. Penney vacated its facility in County East in 1997. The Company is
    currently negotiating its replacement. At Crossroads Mall in Boulder, CO,

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
    Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an
owner of real estate may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of
certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in such property. Such laws often
impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was
responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs
of investigation, removal or remediation of such substances may be substantial,
and the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such
substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such
property or to borrow using such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for
the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable
for the costs of removal or remediation of a release of such substances at a
disposal treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated
by such person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of
asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) into the air and third parties may seek
recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury
associated with ACMs. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect),
operation, management and development of real properties, the Company may be
considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the
disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore potentially
liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs,
including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property.
 
    Each of the Centers has been subjected to a Phase I audit (which involves
review of publicly available information and general property inspections, but
does not involve soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by an
environmental consultant.
 
    Based on these audits, and on other information, the Company is aware of the
following environmental issues that are reasonably possible to result in costs
associated with future investigation or remediation, or in environmental
liability:
 
    - ASBESTOS.  The Company has conducted ACM surveys at various locations
      within the Centers. The surveys indicate that ACMs are present or
      suspected in certain areas, primarily vinyl floor tiles, mastics, roofing
      materials, drywall tape and joint compounds. The identified ACMs are
      generally non-friable, in good condition, and possess low probabilities
      for disturbance. At certain Centers where ACMs are present or suspected,
      however, some ACMs have been or may be classified as "friable," and
      ultimately may require removal under certain conditions. The Company has
      developed and implemented an operations and maintenance (O&M) plan to
      manage ACM in place.
 
    - UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS.  Underground storage tanks (USTs) are or were
      present at certain of the Centers, often in connection with tenant
      operations at gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory
      service centers located at such Centers. USTs also may be or have been
      present at properties neighboring certain Centers. Some of these tanks
      have either leaked or are suspected to have leaked. Where leakage has
      occurred, investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs may be incurred
      by the Company, if the responsible current or former tenant, or other
      responsible parties are unavailable to pay such costs.
 
    - CHLORINATED HYDROCARBONS.  The presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons such
      as perchloroethylene (PCE) and its degradation byproducts have been
      detected at certain of the Centers, often in connection with tenant dry
      cleaning operations. Where PCE has been detected, the Company may incur
      investigation, remediation and monitoring costs if responsible tenants, or
      other responsible parties, are unavailable to pay such costs.
 
    PCE has been detected in soil and groundwater in the vicinity of a dry
cleaning establishment at North Valley Plaza, which was sold to a third party on
December 18, 1997. The California Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC)
advised the Company in 1995 that very low levels of Dichlorethylene (1,2,DCE), a
degradation byproduct of PCE, have been detected in a water well located 1/4
mile west from the dry cleaners, and that the dry cleaning facility may have
contributed to the introduction of 1,2 DCE
 
                                       10
<PAGE>
into the water well. According to DTSC, the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for
1,2DCE which is permitted in drinking water is 6 parts per billion (ppb). The
1,2DCE which was detected in the water well at 1.2 ppb, is below the MCL. The
Company has retained an environmental consultant and has initiated extensive
testing of the site. Remediation began in October 1997. The joint venture that
owned the property (of which the Company is a 50% general partner) agreed as
between itself and the buyer, that it would be responsible for continuing to
pursue the investigation and remediation of impacted soil and groundwater
resulting from releases of PCE from the shopping center's former dry cleaner.
$124,000 and $155,000 has already been incurred for remediation, and
professional and legal fees in 1997 and 1996, respectively. An additional
$561,000 remains reserved as of December 31, 1997. The Company has initiated
cost recovery actions and intends to continue to look to responsible parties for
recovery.
 
    Toluene, a petroleum constituent, was detected in one of three groundwater
dewatering system holding tanks at the Queens Center. Although the source of the
tolulene has not been fully defined, the Company suspects the source to be
either an adjacent automotive service station and/or a previous automotive
service station, which operated on site prior to development of the mall.
Toluene was detected at levels of 410 and 160 parts per billion (ppb) in samples
taken from the tank in October, 1995 and February 1996, respectively. Additional
samples were taken in May and December of 1996, with results of .63 ppb and
"non-detect" for the May sampling event and 16.2 ppb and 25.2 ppb for the
December sampling event. The maximum allowable contaminant level (MCL) for
toluene in drinking water is 1000 ppb. Although the Company believes that no
remediation will be required, it has set up a $150,000 reserve in 1996 to cover
professional fees and testing costs, which was reduced by $18,000 of costs
incurred in 1997. The Company intends to look to the responsible parties and
insurers if remediation is required.
 
    The Company acquired Fresno Fashion Fair in December 1996. Asbestos has been
detected in structural fireproofing throughout much of the Mall. Recent testing
data conducted by a professional environmental consulting firm indicates that
the fireproofing is largely inaccessible to building occupants and is well
adhered to the structural members. Additionally, airborne concentrations of
asbestos are well within OSHA's permissible exposure limit (PEL) of .1 fcc. The
accounting for this acquisition included a reserve of $3.3 million to cover
future removal of this asbestos, as necessary. $170,000 was incurred for
abatement of this asbestos in 1997.
 
    Dry cleaning chemicals including PCE were detected in soil and groundwater
in the vicinity of a former dry cleaning establishment at Huntington Center. The
release has been reported to the local government authorities. The Company has
retained an environmental consultant and is conducting additional site
assessment activities to attempt to determine the extent to which groundwater
has been impacted. The Company estimates, based on the data currently available,
that costs for assessment, remediation and legal services will not exceed
$500,000. Consequently, at the time of the acquisition, the Company established
a $500,000 reserve to cover professional and legal fees. $9,000 and $6,000 has
been incurred for remediation in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The Company
intends to look to responsible parties and insurers for cost recovery.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
    The Company and the Management Companies employ approximately 1,264 persons,
including eight executive officers, personnel in the areas of acquisitions and
business development (5), property management (115), leasing (30),
redevelopment/construction (17), financial services (28) and legal affairs (10).
In addition, in an effort to minimize operating costs, the Company generally
maintains its own security staff (401) and maintenance staff (650).
Approximately 6 of these employees are represented by a union. The Company
believes that relations with its employees are good.

 (1) The land underlying thirty of the Centers is owned in fee entirely by the
     Company or, in the case of jointly-owned Centers, by the property
     partnership. All or part of the land underlying the remaining Centers is
     owned by third parties and leased to the Company or property partnership
     pursuant to long-term ground leases. Under the terms of a typical ground
     lease, the Company or property partnership pays rent for the use of the
     land and is generally responsible for all costs and expenses associated
     with the building and improvements. In some cases, the Company or property
     partnership has an option or right of first refusal to purchase the land.
     The termination dates of the ground leases range from 2000 to 2070. All
     centers are wholly owned by Company or its subsidiaries, except for
     Broadway Plaza (50%), Panorama Mall (50%), West Acres (19%), Manhattan
     Village Shopping Center (10%) and the ERE Yarmouth Portfolio (50%).
 
 (2) Includes GLA attributable to Anchors (whether owned or non-owned) and Mall
     and Freestanding Stores as of December 31, 1997.
 
 (3) Sales are based on reports by retailers leasing Mall and Freestanding
     Stores for the year ending December 31, 1997 for tenants which have
     occupied such stores for a minimum of twelve months. Consistent with
     industry practices, sales per square foot are based on gross leased and
     occupied area, excluding theaters, and are not based on GLA.
 
 (4) Portions of the land on which the Center is situated are subject to one or
     more ground leases.
 
 (5) J.C. Penney vacated its facility in the Center in 1997. The Company is
     currently in negotiations with a replacement tenant.
 
 (6) The Company paid $3 million in 1997 to terminate the Montgomery Ward's
     lease. Gart Sports is temporarily occupying this space until February 1998.
     In addition, the Company bought the Mervyn's building in February, 1998 and
     sold it to Sears. Sears will occupy the former Mervyn's store and the
     Company will recapture the existing Sears building. The Company is
     currently negotiating with other tenants to occupy these locations.
 
 (7) The Broadway Store ceased operations in February 1996. Wal-Mart purchased
     the former Broadway store from Federated in March 1997, commenced retrofit
     of the building in October 1997 and plans to open its new facility in June
     1998.
 
 (8) Spaces comprising Total GLA at December 31, 1997 have only been developed
     and leased within fourth quarter of 1997 and, therefore, comparable sales
     figures are not available for presentation in accordance with the
     presentation methodology outlined in footnote (3).
 
 (9) Certain spaces have been intentionally held off the market and remain
     vacant due to major redevelopment strategy. As a result, the Company
     believes the percentage of mall and free-standing GLA leased at these major
     redevelopments is not meaningful data.
 
 (10) Edwards Cinema signed a lease in January 1997 to occupy the former
      Broadway location. Edwards is expected to open a 21 screen theater complex
      on that site in November 1999.
 
 (11) Sales per square foot information not currently available.
 
 (12) The Company is contemplating various replacement tenant/redevelopment
      opportunities for these vacant sites.

- ------------------------
 
Notes:
 
(1) The annual debt service payment represents the payment of principal and
    interest. In addition, contingent interest, as defined in the loan
    agreement, may be due to the extent that 35% of the gross receipts (as
    defined in the loan agreement) exceeds a base amount specified therein.
    Contingent interest recognized was $398,619 for the year ended December 31,
    1996 and $98,528 for the year ended December 31, 1997.
 
(2) No prepayment except under certain circumstances in the event of the sale of
    the Center.
 
(3) The interest rate is LIBOR plus .45%. LIBOR was 5.81% at December 31, 1997.
    There is an interest rate cap on $10 million of this debt at a LIBOR strike
    rate of 5.88% through maturity. The remaining principal has an interest rate
    cap with a LIBOR strike rate of 7.7%.
 
                                       17
<PAGE>
(4) At December 31, 1997 this loan was at LIBOR plus 1%, which totaled 6.9%. In
    February 1998, this loan was converted to a 10 year loan at a fixed rate of
    6.62%, maturing in February 2008.
 
(5) Reflects the Company's pro rata share of debt.
 
    The Company, at December 31, 1997, had a $60 million unsecured credit
facility with a financial institution which bears interest at approximately
LIBOR plus 1.325% or the institution's prime rate. There was $55 million
outstanding on this facility as of December 31, 1997 and $12 million outstanding
as of December 31, 1996. The Company increased this credit facility to $150
million on February 26, 1998 to partially fund the ERE Yarmouth portfolio.
 
    In addition to the above debt, the Company has also issued $161.4 million of
unsecured subordinated convertible debentures due in December 2002. The
debentures bear interest at 7.25% and are convertible into shares of common
stock of the Company at a conversion price of $31.125.
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
 
    The Company, the Operating Partnership, the Management Companies and the
affiliated partnerships are not currently involved in any material litigation
nor, to the Company's knowledge, is any material litigation currently threatened
against such entities or the Centers, other than routine litigation arising in
the ordinary course of business, most of which is expected to be covered by
liability insurance. For information about certain environmental matters, see
"Business of the Company--Environmental Matters."

</TABLE>
 
    In June and July 1997, the Company sold a total of $161.4 million of its
7 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2002 (the "Debentures"). The
Debentures were offered and sold only (1) outside the U.S. in accordance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), and (2) inside the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers in accordance
with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Lazard Capital Markets, Lehman Brothers
International (Europe) and UBS Limited agreed to purchase the Debentures at a
purchase price of 100% of the principal amount, less an aggregate offering
discount of 2.5% (plus reimbursement of expenses). The Debentures are
convertible, at any time on or after 60 days from the date of issue at a
conversion price of $31.125 per share. The net proceeds of $157.4 million were
used primarily to repay floating rate debt and for general corporate purposes.
On December 22, 1997, the Company filed a shelf registration statement (File No.
333-38721) with respect to $119.4 million of the Debentures.
 
    On February 25, 1998, the Company sold $100 million of its Series A
Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share
(the "Series A Preferred Stock") in a private placement to Security Capital
Preferred Growth Incorporated ("SCPG"), an accredited investor, pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. In connection with the transaction, the
Company paid a placement fee of $1 million to an affiliate of SCPG. The Series A
Preferred Stock can be converted into shares of common stock on a one-for-one
basis. The proceeds from the sale of the Series A Preferred Stock were used to
acquire the ERE Yarmouth portfolio.
 
ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.
 
    The following sets forth selected financial data for the Company on a
historical and pro forma consolidated basis, and for the Centers and the
Management Companies (collectively, the "Predecessor"), on an historical
combined basis. The following data should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements (and the notes thereto) of the Company and "Management's
Discussion And Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" each
included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
 
    The pro forma data for the Company for the year ended December 31, 1994 has
been prepared as if the IPO and the transactions related to the reorganization
of the Operating Partnership and formation of the Company (the "Formation") and
the application of the net proceeds of the IPO had occurred as of
 
                                       19
<PAGE>
January 1, 1994. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of what
the Company's financial position or results of operations would have been
assuming the completion of the Formation and IPO at the beginning of the period
indicated, nor does it purport to project the Company's financial position or
what results of operations would have been assuming the completion of the
Formation and the IPO at the beginning of the period indicated, nor does it
purport to project the Company's financial position or results of operations at
any future date or for any future period.
 
    The Selected Financial Data is presented on a combined basis. The limited
partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (not owned by the REIT) are
reflected in the pro forma data as minority interest. Centers in which the
Company does not have a greater than 50% ownership interest (Panorama Mall,
North Valley Plaza, Broadway Plaza, Manhattan Village and West Acres Shopping
Center) are referred to as the "Joint Venture Centers", and along with the
Management Companies, are reflected in the selected financial data under the
equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the net income from the Joint Venture
Centers and the Management Companies that is allocable to the Company is
included in the statement of operations as Equity in income (loss) of
unconsolidated joint ventures and management companies.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
  OF OPERATIONS
 
  GENERAL BACKGROUND AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
 
    The Company believes that the most significant measures of its operating
performance are Funds from Operations and EBITDA. Funds from Operations is
defined as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains
(or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of real property, plus
depreciation and amortization (excluding depreciation on personal property and
amortization of loan and financial instrument costs), and after adjustments for
unconsolidated entities. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated
on the same basis. Funds from Operations does not represent cash flow from
operations as defined by GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash
available to fund all cash flow needs.
 
    EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation,
amortization, minority interest, income in unconsolidated entities,
extraordinary items and gain (loss) on sale of assets. This data is relevant to
an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it
indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy
certain fixed obligations. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to
operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or to
cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or
as a measure of liquidity. While the performance of individual Centers and the
Management Companies determines EBITDA, the Company's capital structure also
influences Funds from Operations. The most important component in determining
EBITDA and Funds from Operations is Center revenues. Center revenues consist
primarily of minimum rents, percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries.
Minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market
rents that are higher than prior rents. Minimum rent will also fluctuate up or
down with changes in the occupancy level. Additionally, to the extent that new
leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms, expense recoveries
will increase.
 
    Percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant
sales. As leases roll over, however, a portion of historical percentage rent is
often converted to minimum rent. It is therefore common for percentage rents to
decrease as minimum rents increase. Accordingly, in discussing financial
performance, the Company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to
better measure revenue growth.
 
    The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial
statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.
The following discussion compares the activity for the year ended December 31,
1997 to results of operations for 1996. Also included is a comparison of the
activities for the year ended December 31, 1996 to the results for the year
ended December 31, 1995.
 
    This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
 
    This annual report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates statements that
constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements appear in a number of

</TABLE>
 
The financial statements include the results of these centers for periods
subsequent to their acquisition.
 
    Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below,
occurred due to the addition of these properties to the portfolio during 1997
and 1996. Many factors, such as the availability and cost of capital, overall
debt to market capitalization level, interest rates and availability of
potential acquisition targets that meet the Company's criteria, impact the
Company's ability to acquire additional properties. Accordingly, management is
uncertain as to whether during the balance of 1998, and in future years, there
will be similar acquisitions and corresponding increases in revenues, net income
and funds from operations that occurred as a result of the addition of the 1997
and 1996 Acquisition Centers. All other centers are referred to herein as the
"Same Centers".
 
    The bankruptcy and/or closure of retail stores, particularly Anchors, may
reduce customer traffic and cash flow generated by a Center. During 1997,
Montgomery Ward filed bankruptcy. The Company has 11 Montgomery Ward stores in
its portfolio. Montgomery Ward has not yet disclosed whether they will cease
operating any of their stores in the Company's centers. The long-term closure of
these or other stores could adversely affect the Company's performance.
 
    In addition, the Company's success in the highly competitive real estate
shopping center business depends upon many other factors, including general
economic conditions, the ability of tenants to make rent payments, increases or
decreases in operating expenses, occupancy levels, changes in demographics,
competition from other centers and forms of retailing and the ability to renew
leases or relet space upon the expiration or termination of leases.
 
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
 
    Total assets increased to $1,505 million at December 31, 1997 compared to
$1,188 million at December 31, 1996 and $763 million at December 31, 1995.
During that same period, total liabilities increased from $509 million in 1995
to $838 million in 1996 and $1,188 million in 1997. These changes were primarily
as a result of the 1996 and 1995 common stock offerings, the 1997 convertible
debenture offering,

transactions described below.
 
A.  CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE OFFERING

subordinated debentures due 2002 and an additional $11.4 million of debentures
were sold in July 1997 ("the Debentures"). The Debentures, which were sold at
par, bear interest at 7.25% annually (payable semi-annually) and are convertible
into shares of the Company's common stock at any time, on or after 60 days, from
the date of issue at a conversion price of $31.125 per share. The Debentures
mature on December 15, 2002 and are callable by the Company after June 15, 2002
at par plus accrued interest. The net proceeds from the sale of the Debentures
of $157.4 million were used to repay floating rate debt and for general
corporate purposes.

the balance from the Company's line of credit.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1996
 
    REVENUES
 
    Minimum and percentage rents increased by 44% to $151.5 million from $105.2.
Approximately $36.0 million of the increase resulted from the 1996 Acquisition
Centers and $11.9 million resulted from the 1997 Acquisition Centers. These
increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.5 million at Parklane Mall
and $0.3 million at Crossroads-Boulder, both due to reduced occupancy incurred
during redevelopment.
 
                                       24
<PAGE>
    Tenant recoveries increased to $66.5 million in 1997 from $47.7 million in
1996. The 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers generated $19.6 million of this
increase. These increases were partially offset by an $0.8 million reduction in
Same Center recoverable expenses in 1997 compared to 1996.
 
    Other income increased to $3.2 million in 1997 from $2.2 million in 1996.
Approximately $0.5 million of the increase related to the 1997 and 1996
Acquisition Centers, and approximately $0.5 million of this increase resulted
from nonrecurring fee income received in 1997.
 
    EXPENSES
 
    Shopping center expenses increased to $70.9 million in 1997 compared to
$50.8 million in 1996. Approximately $20.9 million of the increase resulted from
the 1997 and 1996 Acquisition Centers. The other centers had a net decrease of
$0.8 million in shopping center expenses resulting primarily from decreased
property taxes, insurance premiums and recoverable expenses.
 
    General and administrative expenses increased to $2.8 million in 1997 from
$2.4 million in 1996, primarily due to increased executive and director
compensation expense and professional fee expense.
 
    INTEREST EXPENSE
 
    Interest expense increased to $66.4 million in 1997 from $42.4 million in
1996. This increase of $24.0 million is attributable to the acquisition activity
in 1997 and 1996, which was partially funded with secured debt. In addition, in
1997 the Company issued $161.4 million of convertible debentures.
 
    DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
 
    Depreciation increased to $41.5 million from $32.6 million in 1996. This
increase relates primarily to the 1996 and 1997 Acquisition Centers.
 
    MINORITY INTEREST
 
    The minority interest represents the 31.8% weighted average interest of the
Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during 1997. This
compares to 36.9% not owned by the Company during 1996.
 
    INCOME (LOSS) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES
 
    The loss from unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies was
$8.1 million for 1997, compared to a gain of $3.3 million in 1996. A total of
$10.5 million of the change is attributable to the write down, and the loss on
the sale, of North Valley Plaza in 1997.
 
    GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS
 
    During 1997 the Company sold a parcel of land for a net gain of $1.6
million. There was no gain on sale recognized in 1996.
 
    EXTRAORDINARY LOSS FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT
 
    In 1997 the Company wrote off $0.6 million of unamortized financing costs,
compared to $0.3 million written off in 1996.
 
    NET INCOME
 
    As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $22.0 million in 1997
from $18.9 million in 1996.
 
                                       25
<PAGE>
    OPERATING ACTIVITIES
 
    Cash flow from operations was $78.5 million compared to $80.4 million in
1996. The decrease resulted from the factors discussed above, primarily the
impact of the 1996 and 1997 Acquisition Centers and related financings.
 
    INVESTING ACTIVITIES
 
    Cash flow used in investing activities was $215.0 million in 1997 compared
to $296.7 million in 1996. The change resulted primarily from the four
acquisitions completed in 1997, compared to seven acquisitions in 1996.
 
    FINANCING ACTIVITIES
 
    Cash flow from financing activities was $146.0 million in 1997 compared to
$216.3 million in 1996. The decrease resulted from more acquisition financing
done in 1996 than 1997.
 
    EBITDA AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS
 
    Due primarily to the factors mentioned above, EBITDA increased 45% to $147.6
million in 1997 from $101.9 million in 1996 and Funds From Operations increased
33% to $83.2 million from $62.4 million in 1996.
 
  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 AND 1995
 
    REVENUES
 
    Minimum and percentage rents increased by 42% to $105.2 million from $74.1
million. Approximately $19.0 million of the increase resulted from the 1995
Acquisition Centers and $13.2 million resulted from the 1996 Acquisition
Centers. These increases were partially offset by declining rents of $1.1
million at Parklane Mall which was adversely impacted by an Anchor closure in
1996.
 
    Tenant recoveries increased to $47.7 million in 1996 from $27.0 million in
1995. The 1996 and 1995 Acquisition Centers caused $19.3 million of this
increase. Approximately $1.1 million of the increase was due to higher
recoverable expenses in 1996 compared to 1995.
 
    Other income increased to $2.2 million in 1996 from $1.4 million in 1995.
Approximately $1.2 million of the increase related to the 1996 and 1995
Acquisition Centers. This increase was partially offset by lower interest income
of $0.3 million in 1996 compared to 1995.
 
    EXPENSES
 
    Shopping center expenses increased to $50.8 million in 1996 compared to
$31.6 million in 1995. Approximately $18.7 million of the increase resulted from
the 1996 and 1995 Acquisition Centers. The other centers had a net increase of
$0.5 million in shopping center expenses of which approximately $1.1 million was
for increased property taxes and $0.5 million of increased bad debt expense,
offset by a reduction in ground rent expense of $1.3 million which resulted from
the October, 1995 acquisition of land at Crossroads Mall--Boulder which had
previously been leased.
 
    General and administrative expenses increased to $2.4 million in 1996 from
$2.0 million in 1995 primarily due to increased professional fee expense.
 
    INTEREST EXPENSE
 
    Interest expense increased to $42.4 million in 1996 from $25.5 million in
1995. Interest expense attributable to County East Mall decreased $1.2 million
in 1996 due to the payoff of that debt on
 
                                       26
<PAGE>
December 31, 1995. Also, there was a decrease of $1.3 million at Crossroads
Mall--Boulder due to a December 1995 refinancing at a substantially lower
interest rate. These reductions partially offset the increase of $19.1 million
from the 1995 and 1996 Acquisition Centers.
 
    DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
 
    Depreciation increased to $32.6 million from $25.7 million in 1995. An
increase of approximately $7.6 million related to the 1995 and 1996 Acquisition
Centers. This increase was offset by a decrease of approximately $1.4 million in
amortization of financial instruments in 1996 which resulted from several
financial instruments becoming fully amortized in 1995.
 
    MINORITY INTEREST
 
    The minority interest represents the 36.9% weighted average interest of the
Operating Partnership that was not owned by the Company during 1996, compared to
45.0% during 1995.
 
    INCOME (LOSS) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES
 
    The income from unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies
was $3.3 million for 1996, which was essentially the same as 1995.
 
    EXTRAORDINARY LOSS FROM EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT
 
    In connection with the sale of an interest rate cap, the Company wrote off
unamortized financing costs of $0.3 million in 1996. In 1995 the Company wrote
off $1.3 million of loan costs concurrent with the 1995 refinancing of Lakewood
Mall.
 
    NET INCOME
 
    As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $18.9 million in 1996
from $11.3 million in 1995.
 
    OPERATING ACTIVITIES
 
    Cash flow from operations increased to $80.4 million compared to $48.2
million in 1995. The increase resulted from the factors discussed above,
primarily the impact of the 1995 and 1996 Acquisition Centers.
 
    INVESTING ACTIVITIES
 
    Cash flow used in investing activities was $296.7 million in 1996 compared
to $88.4 million in 1995. The change resulted primarily from the seven
acquisitions completed in 1996 compared to three acquisitions in 1995.
 
    FINANCING ACTIVITIES
 
    Cash flow from financing activities increased to $216.3 million in 1996
compared to $52.0 million in 1995. The increase resulted from more mortgage
financing done in 1996, primarily to fund the 1996 acquisitions.
 
    EBITDA AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS
 
    Due primarily to the factors mentioned above, EBITDA increased 48%, to
$101.9 million in 1996 from $68.9 million in 1995 and Funds From Operations
increased 39%, to $62.4 million, from $44.9 million in 1995.

    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
    The Company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through
cash generated from operations and working capital reserves. The Company
anticipates that revenues will continue to provide necessary funds for its
operating expenses and debt service requirements, and to pay dividends to
stockholders in accordance with REIT requirements. The Company anticipates that
cash generated from operations, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to
fund capital expenditures which will not be reimbursed by tenants, other than
non-recurring capital expenditures. Capital for major expenditures or
redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from equity
or debt financings.
 
    The Company believes that it will have access to the capital necessary to
expand its business in accordance with its strategies for growth and maximizing
Funds from Operations. The Company presently intends to obtain additional
capital necessary to expand its business through a combination of additional
equity offerings and debt financings.
 
    The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 1997 was
$1.2 billion (including its pro rata share of joint venture debt). This equated
to a debt to Total Market Capitalization (defined as total debt of the Operating
Partnership, including its pro rata share of joint venture debt, plus aggregate
market value of outstanding shares of common stock, assuming full conversion of
OP Units into stock) rate of approximately 51.5% at year end. Such debt consists
primarily of conventional mortgages payable secured by individual properties.
See "Properties--Mortgage Debt" for a description of the Company's outstanding
indebtedness. In connection with $65.1 million of the Company's floating rate
indebtedness, the Company has entered into interest rate protection agreements
that limit the Company's exposure to increases in interest rates. See
"Properties--Mortgage Debt."
 
    The Company has filed a shelf registration statement, effective December 8,
1997, to sell securities. The shelf registration is for a total of $500 million
of common stock or common stock warrants. On February 18, 1998, the Company
issued 1,826,484 shares from the shelf and on February 12, 1998 an additional
1,052,650 shares were issued from the shelf. The total proceeds of both
transactions were approximately $79.6 million, leaving approximately $420
million available on the shelf registration.
 
    The Company has an unsecured line of credit which has been recently expanded
up to $150 million. There was $55 million outstanding at December 31, 1997 and
$123 million outstanding after the ERE Yarmouth portfolio acquisition on
February 27, 1998.
 
    At December 31, 1997 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $25.2
million.
 
    YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE
 
    The Company has been advised by its independent software vendor that it has
completed its evaluation, testing and modification of the property management
and accounting software used by the Company and the necessary changes have been
completed to achieve year 2000 compliance. The Company does not believe it will
have any significant accounting or operations impact as a result of the year
2000.
 
    FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS
 
    The Company believes that the most significant measure of its performance is
Funds from Operations ("FFO"). FFO is defined by The National Association of
Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") to be: Net income (computed in
accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and
sales of real property, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding
depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial
instrument cost) and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. Adjustments
for unconsolidated entities will be calculated on the same basis. FFO does not
represent cash flow from operations, as defined by generally accepted accounting
principles, and is not
 
                                       28
<PAGE>
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The
following reconciles net income to FFO:

- ------------------------
 
(1) Calculated based upon basic net income as adjusted to reach basic FFO.
    Weighted average number of shares includes the weighted average shares of
    common stock outstanding for 1997 assuming the conversion of OP units.
 
(2) The computation of dilutive and diluted average number of shares outstanding
    includes the effect of common stock options outstanding and restricted stock
    using the Treasury method. Convertible debentures are antidilutive and are
    not included.
 
    Included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice
of straight lining of rents. The amount of straight lining of rents that
impacted minimum rents was $3,599,000 for 1997, $1,832,000 for 1996 and $944,000
for 1995.
 
    INFLATION
 
    In the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the
Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the
Centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term. These rent
increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the Consumer
Price Index. In addition, many of the leases are for terms of less than ten
years, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at
higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then
existing market rate. Additionally, most of the leases require the tenants to
pay their
 
                                       29
<PAGE>
pro rata share of operating expenses. This reduces the Company's exposure to
increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
 
    NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED:
 
    In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for
the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full
set of general purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as
the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions
and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources. The Company does not
expect this pronouncement to materially impact the Company's results of
operations.
 
    In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
disclosure about operating segments in annual financial statements and selected
information in interim financial reports. It also establishes standards for
related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major
customers. This statement supercedes SFAS No. 14, Financial Reporting for
Segments of a Business Enterprise. The new standard becomes effective for the
Company for the year ending December 31, 1998, and requires that comparative
information from earlier years be restated to conform to the requirements of
this standard. The Company does not expect this pronouncement to materially
change the Company's current reporting and disclosures.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Macerich Company
 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of The Macerich Company as listed in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule based
on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Macerich
Company as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results of the
Macerich Company's operations and its cash flows for the years ended December
31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
required to be included therein.

Company is the sole general partner of and holds a 68% ownership interest in The
Macerich Partnership, L.P. ("the Operating Partnership"). The interests in the
Operating Partnership are known as OP Units. OP Units not held by the Company
can be exchanged, subject to certain restrictions, on a one-for-one basis, into
the Company's common stock.
 
    The Company was organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust
("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The 32% limited
partnership interest of the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company is
reflected in these financial statements as minority interest. The average total
number of OP Units outstanding in The Operating Partnership (including the OP
Units owned by the Company) was 37,982,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997,
32,934,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996, and 26,930,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1995.
 
    The property management, leasing and redevelopment of the Company's
portfolio is provided by the Macerich Management Company, Macerich Property
Management Company and Macerich Manhattan Management Company, all California
corporations (together referred to hereafter as "the Management Companies"). The
non-voting preferred stock of the Macerich Management Company and Macerich
Property Management Company is owned by the Operating Partnership, which
provides the Operating Partnership the right to receive 95% of the distributable
cash flow from the Management Companies. Macerich Manhattan Management Company
is a 100% subsidiary of Macerich Management Company.
 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION:
 
    The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of
the Company and the Operating Partnership. The properties which the Operating
Partnership does not own a greater than 50% interest in, and the Management
Companies, have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These
entities are reflected on the Company's consolidated financial statements as
investment in joint ventures and the Management Companies.
 
    All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in the consolidated financial statements.
 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
 
    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:
 
    The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents, for which
cost approximates market. Included in cash is restricted cash of $5,810 at
December 31, 1997 and $3,783 at December 31, 1996.
 
    REVENUES:
 
    Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of the related lease. The difference between the amount of rent due in a
year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight
lining of rent adjustment." Rental income was increased by $3,599 in 1997,
$1,832 in 1996 and $944 in 1995 due to the straight lining of rent adjustment.
Percentage rents are

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
 
    recognized on an accrual basis. Recoveries from tenants for real estate
taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as
revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred.
 
    The Management Companies provide property management, leasing, corporate,
development and acquisitions services to affiliated and non-affiliated shopping
centers. In consideration for these services, the Management Companies receive
monthly management fees generally ranging from 1.5% to 5% of the gross monthly
rental revenue of the properties managed.
 
    PROPERTY:
 
    Costs related to the acquisition, development, construction and improvement
of properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until construction
is substantially complete.
 
    Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as
incurred. Realized gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement
of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.
 
    Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
 
<TABLE>
<S>                                       <C>
Tenant improvements.....................  initial term of related lease
Buildings and improvements..............  5-40 years
Equipment and furnishings...............  5-7 years
</TABLE>
 
    The Company assesses whether there has been a permanent impairment in the
value of its assets by considering factors such as expected future operating
income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and
other economic factors. Such factors include the tenants ability to perform
their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases. The Company may
recognize a permanent impairment loss if the income stream were not sufficient
to cover its investment. Such a loss would be determined between the carrying
value and the fair value of a center. Management believes no permanent
impairment has occurred in its net property carrying values at December 31,
1997.
 
    DEFERRED CHARGES:
 
    Costs relating to financing of shopping center properties and obtaining
tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement.
The straight-line method is used to amortize all costs except financing, for
which the effective interest method is used. The range of the terms of the
agreements are as follows:
 
<TABLE>
<S>                             <C>
Deferred lease costs..........  2-15 years
Deferred financing costs......  1-15 years
</TABLE>
 
    DEFERRED ACQUISITION LIABILITY:
 
    As part of the Company's total consideration to the seller of Capitola Mall,
the Company will issue $5,000 of OP Units five years after the acquisition date,
which was December 21, 1995. The number of OP Units will be determined based on
the Company's common stock price at that time.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: (CONTINUED)
    INCOME TAXES:
 
    The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. A REIT is generally not subject to income taxation on
that portion of its income that qualifies as REIT taxable income as long as it
distributes at least 95 percent of its taxable income to its stockholders and
complies with other requirements. Accordingly, no provision has been made for
income taxes in the consolidated financial statements.
 
    On a tax basis, the distributions of $1.78 paid during 1997 represented
$0.96 of ordinary income and $0.82 of return of capital and the distributions of
$1.70 per share during 1996 represented $1.14 of ordinary income and $0.56
return of capital. During 1995 the distributions were $1.66 per share of which
$1.00 was ordinary income and $0.66 was return of capital.
 
    Each partner is taxed individually on their share of partnership income or
loss, and accordingly, no provision for federal and state income tax is provided
for the Operating Partnership in the consolidated financial statements.
 
    RECLASSIFICATIONS:
 
    Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1995 and 1996 financial
statements to conform to the 1997 financial statement presentation.
 
    ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:
 
    In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for
the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full
set of general purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as
the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions
and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources. The Company does not
expect this pronouncement to materially impact the Company's results of
operations.
 
    In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
disclosure about operating segments in annual financial statements and selected
information in interim financial reports. It also establishes standards for
related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major
customers. This statement supercedes SFAS No. 14, Financial Reporting for
Segments of a Business Enterprise. The new standard becomes effective for the
Company for the year ending December 31, 1998, and requires that comparative
information from earlier years be restated to conform to the requirements of
this standard. The Company does not expect this pronouncement to materially
change the Company's current reporting and disclosures.
 
    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:
 
    To meet the reporting requirement of SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments, the Company calculates the fair value of
financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to
financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of
those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the
carrying value, no additional disclosure is made. The estimated fair value
amounts have been determined by the Company using available market information
and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment

is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of
the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use
of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a
material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
 
    Interest rate cap agreements are purchased by the Company from third parties
to hedge the risk of interest rate increases on some of the Company's variable
rate debt. The cost of these cap agreements is amortized over the life of the
cap agreement on a straight line basis. Payments received as a result of the cap
agreements are recorded as a reduction of interest expense. The unamortized
costs of the cap agreements are included in deferred charges. The fair market
value of these caps will vary with fluctuations in interest rates. The Company
is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counter
parties to the financial instruments, however, management does not anticipate
nonperformance by the counter party.
 
    EARNINGS PER SHARE ("EPS"):
 
    During 1997, the Company implemented SFAS No. 128. The computation of basic
earnings per share is based on net income and the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.
The computation of diluted earnings per share includes the effect of outstanding
restricted stock and common stock options calculated using the Treasury stock
method. The convertible debentures were not included in the calculation as the
effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. The OP Units not held by the
Company have not been included in the diluted EPS calculation as there would be
no effect on the per share amounts as earnings allocated to an OP Unit are the
same amount as allocated to a share of common stock. The following table
reconciles the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation:

    The Centers derived approximately 89.5% of their total rents for the year
ended December 31, 1997 from Mall and Freestanding Stores. The Limited
represented 7.6% of total minimum rents in place as of December 31, 1997 and no
other retailer represented more than 4.6% of total minimum rents as of December
31, 1997.
 
    MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES:
 
    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
    YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE
 
    The Company has been advised by its independent software vendor that it has
completed its evaluation and testing and has made the necessary changes to the
property management and accounting software utilized by the Company and the
software is in year 2000 compliance. The Company does not believe there will be
any significant accounting impact as a result of the year 2000.
 
3. INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND THE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES:
 
    The following are the Company's investments in various real estate joint
ventures which own regional retail shopping centers. The Operating Partnership's
interest in each joint venture as of December 31, 1997 is as follows:

    The Operating Partnership also owns the non-voting preferred stock of the
Management Companies and is entitled to receive 95% of the distributable cash
flow. The Company accounts for the management companies and joint ventures using
the equity method of accounting.
 
    On August 19, 1997 Macerich acquired a 10% interest in the joint venture
that acquired Manhattan Village Shopping Center ("Manhattan Village") in
Manhattan Beach, California. The results of that joint venture are included for
the period subsequent to the acquisition. In December 1997, North Valley Plaza,
which was 50% owned by the Company, was sold.
 
    Combined and condensed balance sheets and statements of operations are
presented below for all unconsolidated joint ventures, and the Management
Companies, followed by information regarding the Operating Partnership's
beneficial interest in the combined operations. Beneficial interest is
calculated based on the Operating Partnership's ownership interests in the joint
ventures and the Management Companies.

    Perchloroethylene (PCE) has been detected in soil and groundwater in the
vicinity of a dry cleaning establishment at North Valley Plaza, which was sold
to a third party on December 18, 1997. The California Department of Toxic
Substance Control (DTSC) advised the Company in 1995 that very low levels of
Dichlorethylene (1,2,DCE), a degradation byproduct of PCE, have been detected in
a water well located 1/4 mile west from the dry cleaners, and that the dry
cleaning facility may have contributed to the introduction of 1,2 DCE into the
water well. According to DTSC, the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for 1,2DCE
which is permitted in drinking water is 6 parts per billion (ppb). The 1,2DCE
which was detected in the water well at 1.2 ppb, is below the MCL. The Company
has retained an environmental consultant and has initiated extensive testing of
the site. Remediation began in October 1997. The joint venture that owned the
property agreed (between itself and the buyer) that it would be responsible for
continuing to pursue the investigation and remediation of impacted soil and
groundwater resulting from releases of PCE from the shopping center's former dry
cleaner. $124 and $155 has already been incurred by the Company for remediation,
and professional and legal fees in 1997 and 1996, respectively. An additional
$561 remains reserved by the Company as of December 31, 1997. The Company has
initiated cost recovery actions and intends to continue to look to responsible
parties for recovery.
 
    Toluene, a petroleum constituent, was detected in one of three groundwater
dewatering system holding tanks at Queens Center. Although the source of the
tolulene has not been fully defined, the Company suspects the source to be
either an adjacent automotive service station and/or a previous automotive
service station, which operated on site prior to development of the mall.
Toluene was detected at levels of 410 and 160 parts per billion (ppb) in samples
taken from the tank in October, 1995 and February 1996, respectively. Additional
samples were taken in May and December of 1996, with results of .63 ppb and
"non-detect" for the May sampling event and 16.2 ppb and 25.2 ppb for the
December sampling event. The maximum containment level (MCL) for toluene in
drinking water is 1000 ppb. Although the Company believes that no remediation
will be required, it set up a $150 reserve in 1996 to cover professional fees
and testing costs, which was reduced by $18 of costs incurred in 1997. The
Company intends to look to the responsible parties and insurers if remediation
is required.
 
    The Company acquired Fresno Fashion Fair in December 1996. Asbestos has been
detected in structural fireproofing throughout much of the Mall. Recent testing
data conducted by professional environmental consulting firms indicates that the
fireproofing is largely inaccessible to building occupants and is well adhered
to the structural members. Additionally, airborne concentrations of asbestos are
well within OSHA's permissible exposure limit (PEL) of .1 fcc. The accounting
for this acquisition included a reserve of $3,300 to cover future removal of
this asbestos, as necessary. The Company incurred $170 for abatement of this
asbestos in 1997.
 
    Dry cleaning chemicals including PCE were detected in soil and groundwater
in the vicinity of a former dry cleaning establishment at Huntington Center. The
release has been reported to the local government authorities. The Company has
retained an environmental consultant and is conducting additional site
assessment activities to attempt to determine the extent to which groundwater
has been impacted. The Company estimates, based on the data currently available,
that costs for assessment, remediation and legal services will not exceed $500.
Consequently, at the time of the acquisition, the Company established a $500
reserve to cover professional and legal fees. $9 and $6 has been incurred for
remediation in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The Company intends to look to
responsible parties and insurers for cost recovery.

12. PROFIT SHARING PLAN:
 
    The Management Companies and the Company have a retirement profit sharing
plan that was established in 1984 covering substantially all of their eligible
employees. The plan is qualified in accordance with section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Effective January 1, 1995 this plan was modified to
include a 401(k) plan whereby employees can elect to defer compensation subject
to Internal Revenue Service withholding rules. Contributions by the Management
Companies are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are based
upon a specified percentage of employee compensation. The Management Companies
and the Company contributed $400, $350 and $348 to the plan in 1997, 1996 and
1995, respectively.
 
13. STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN:
 
    The Company has established an employee stock incentive plan under which
stock options or restricted stock may be awarded for the purpose of attracting
and retaining executive officers, directors and key employees. The Company has
issued options to employees and directors to purchase shares of the Company
under the stock incentive plan. The term of these options is ten years from the
grant date. These options generally vest 33 1/3% per year over three years and
were issued and are exercisable at the market value of the common stock at the
grant date.
 
    In addition, the Company has established a plan for non employee directors.
The non employee director options have a term of ten years from the grant date,
vest six months after grant and are issued at the market value of the common
stock on grant date. The plan reserved 52,500 shares, all of which were granted
as of December 31, 1997.
 
    Also, under the employees stock incentive plan 131,196 shares of restricted
stock have been issued to executives. These awards are granted based on certain
performance criteria for the Company. The restricted stock generally vests over
5 years and the compensation expense related to these grants is determined by
market value at the grant date and is amortized over the vesting period on a
straight line basis. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, 8,248 and 0 shares,
respectively, of restricted stock had vested. A total of 89,958 shares at a
weighted average price of $27.46 were issued in 1997 and 41,238 shares were
issued during 1996, at a weighted average price of $20.70, no shares were issued
or outstanding in 1995. Restricted stock is subject to restrictions determined
by the Company's compensation committee. Restricted stock has the same dividend
and voting rights as other common stock and is considered issued when vested.
Compensation expense for restricted stock was $239 in 1997 and $0 for the years
ended December 31, 1996 and 1995.

13. STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN: (CONTINUED)
 
    The weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding at
December 31, 1997 is 6.25 years and the weighted average remaining contractual
life for options exercisable at December 31, 1997 is 6.25 years.
 
    The Company records options granted using Accounting Principles Board (APB)
opinion Number 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and Related
Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized on the date
the options are granted. If the Company had recorded compensation expense using
the methodology prescribed in Financial Accounting Standards Number 123, the
Company's net income would have been reduced by approximately $108 or $0.00 per
share for the year ended December 31, 1997 and $56 or $0.00 per share for the
year ended December 31, 1996.
 
    The weighted average fair value of options granted during 1997 and 1996 are
$2.51 and $1.89, respectively. The fair value of each option grant issued in
1997 and 1996 is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: (a)
dividend yield of 7.0% in 1997 and 7.5% in 1996, (b) expected volatility of the
Company's stock of 14.9% in 1997 and 17.6% in 1996, (c) a risk free interest
rate based on U.S. Zero Coupon Bonds with time of maturity approximately equal
to the options' expected time to exercise and (d) expected option lives of five
and seven years for options granted in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
 
14. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS:
 
    The Company has established deferred compensation plans under which key
executives of the Company may elect to defer receiving a portion of their cash
compensation otherwise payable in one calendar year until a later year. The
Company may, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion,
credit a participant's account with an amount equal to a percentage of the
participant's deferral. The Company contributed $154 during 1997, $125 during
1996 and $104 in 1995 to two of these plans.
 
    In addition, certain executives have split dollar life insurance agreements
with the Company whereby the Company generally pays annual premiums on a life
insurance policy in an amount equal to the executives deferral under one of the
Company's deferred compensation plans.

   The securities represented by this certificate are subject to restrictions 
on ownership and transfer for the purpose of the Corporation's maintenance of 
its status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Except as otherwise provided pursuant to 
the charter of the Corporation, no Person may (1) Beneficially Own shares of 
Equity Stock in excess of 5.0% (or such greater percentage as may be provided 
in the charter of the Corporation) of the number or value of the outstanding 
Equity Stock of the Corporation (unless such Person is an Excluded 
Participant), or (2) Beneficially Own Equity Stock that would result in the 
Corporation being "closely held" under Section 856(h) of the Code (determined 
without regard to Code Section 856(h)(2) and by deleting the words "the last 
half of" in the first sentence of Code Section 542(a)(2) in applying Code 
Section 856(h)), or (3) beneficially own Equity Stock that would result in 
Common Stock and Preferred Stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 
Persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution). Any 
Person who attempts to Beneficially Own Shares of Equity Stock in excess of 
the above limitations must immediately notify the Corporation. All 
capitalized terms in this legend have the meanings defined in the 
Corporation's charter, as the same may be further amended from time to time, 
a copy of which, including the restrictions on ownership or transfer, will be 
sent without charge to each stockholder who so requests. Transfers or other 
events in violation of the restrictions described above shall be null and 
void AB INITIO, and the purported transferee or purported owner shall acquire 
or retain no rights to, or economic interest in, any Equity Stock held in 
violation of these restrictions. The Corporation may redeem such shares upon 
the terms and conditions specified by the Board of Directors in its sole 
discretion if the Board of Directors determines that a Transfer or other 
event would violate the restrictions described above. In addition, if the 
restrictions on ownership or transfer are violated, the shares of Equity 
Stock represented hereby shall be automatically exchanged for shares of 
Excess Stock which will be held in trust for the benefit of a Beneficiary. 
Excess stock may not be transferred at a profit. The Corporation has an 
option to acquire Excess Stock under certain circumstances.

                               AMENDMENT TO THE
                             AMENDED AND RESTATED
                       LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF
                        THE MACERICH PARTNERSHIP, L.P.

     THIS AMENDMENT (the "AMENDMENT") TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED LIMITED 
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT DATED AS OF MARCH 16, 1994, AMENDED AS OF AUGUST 14, 
1995 AND AS OF JUNE 27, 1997 (the "AGREEMENT") OF THE MACERICH PARTNERSHIP, 
L.P. (the "PARTNERSHIP") is dated effective as of November 16, 1997.

                                  RECITALS

     WHEREAS, The Macerich Company, the general partner of the Partnership 
(the "GENERAL PARTNER"), has determined to amend the Partnership Agreement to 
clarify and confirm its ability to borrow funds from the Partnership in order 
to make loans for such purposes as are permitted under The Macerich Company 
Amended and Restated 1994 Incentive Plan (the "PLAN").

     WHEREAS, SECTION 3.3(c) of the Agreement contemplates that the General 
Partner may provide incentives to its executive officers in accordance with 
the Plan, including the making of loans to such executive officers for such 
purposes as are permitted by the Plan;

     WHEREAS, SECTION 3.4 of the Agreement purportedly limits the ability of 
the General Partner to incur indebtedness and does not expressly include an 
exception that would allow the General Partner to incur indebtedness from the 
Partnership for such purposes as are permitted under the Plan and as 
contemplated by SECTION 3.3(c) of the Agreement;

     WHEREAS, the operation of SECTION 3.4 of the Agreement together with 
SECTION 3.3(c) of the Agreement creates an ambiguity which the General 
Partner desires to clarify;

     WHEREAS, the General Partner has determined that authorizing the General 
Partner to incur indebtedness from the Partnership for such purposes as are 
permitted under the Plan is a change that is of an inconsequential nature and 
does not adversely affect the limited partners in any material respect;

     WHEREAS, SECTION 12.1(b)(iv) of the Agreement provides that the General 
Partner has the power, without the consent of the limited partners of the 
Partnership, to amend the Agreement as may be required to (i) cure any 
ambiguity and correct any provision of the Agreement or (ii) reflect a change 
that is of an inconsequential nature and does not adversely affect the 
limited partners in any material respect;

                                       1
<PAGE>

     WHEREAS, the General Partner has made the determination that consent of 
the partners of the Partnership is not required with respect to the matters 
set forth in this Amendment because this Amendment: (i) is being executed for 
the purpose of curing an ambiguity created by the relationship between 
SECTION 3.3(c) and SECTION 3.3 (and correcting SECTION 3.4); (ii) in any 
event, reflects a change that is of an inconsequential nature and does not 
adversely affect the limited partners in any material respect; and (iii) does 
not otherwise require the consent of the limited partners pursuant to SECTION 
12.1(c); and

     WHEREAS, all things necessary to make this Amendment a valid agreement 
of the Partnership have been done;

     NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the authority granted to the General Partner 
under the Agreement, the Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

1.   Amendment:

     Section 3.4 of the Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in SECTION 3.3, the General 
     Partner may from time to time advance funds to the Partnership for any 
     proper Partnership purpose as a loan ("FUNDING LOAN") or a preferred 
     equity investment ("PREFERRED INVESTMENT"), provided that any such funds 
     must first be obtained by the General Partner from a third party lender, 
     and then all of such funds must be advanced or contributed by the 
     General Partner to the Partnership as a Funding Loan or Preferred 
     Investment on substantially the same terms and conditions, including 
     principal amount or preferred equity amount, rate of interest or 
     preferred return, repayment or redemption schedule, and costs and 
     expenses, as shall be applicable with respect to or incurred in 
     connection with such loan with such third party lender. The General 
     Partner shall not incur any indebtedness for borrowed funds, except for 
     (i) Funding Loans or Preferred Investments; (ii) loans from the 
     Partnership to the General Partner to the extent the proceeds thereof 
     are used to fund, directly or indirectly, participations in, or 
     acquisitions of, any real or personal property interests for the account 
     of the General Partner if, and only if, the Partnership participates or 
     acquires an interest in such property at least to the extent of 99 times 
     such proposed participation or acquisition, directly or through a 
     wholly-owned entity, by the General Partner; and/or (iii) loans from the 
     Partnership to the General Partner to facilitate the making of loans by 
     the General Partner for such purposes as are authorized under the Plan.

2.   DEFINED TERMS AND RECITALS.  As used in this Amendment, capitalized 
terms used and defined in this Amendment shall have the meaning assigned to 
them in this Amendment, and capitalized terms used in this Amendment but not 
defined herein, shall have the meaning assigned

                                       2

to them in the Agreement.

3.   RATIFICATION AND CONFIRMATION.  Except to the extent specifically 
amended by this Amendment, the terms and provisions of the Agreement, as 
previously amended, are hereby ratified and confirmed.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Amendment 
effective as of the date first above mentioned.

                                 RECITALS

     WHEREAS, The Macerich Company, the general partner of the Partnership 
(the "GENERAL PARTNER"), will be issuing to Security Capital Preferred Growth 
Incorporated ("Security Capital"), 3,627,131 shares of Series A Cumulative 
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, $.01 par value per share ("SERIES A 
PREFERRED SHARES"), pursuant to the Series A Preferred Securities Purchase 
Agreement dated as of January 19, 1998 between the General Partner and 
Security Capital (the "Purchase Agreement");

     WHEREAS, SECTION 3.3 (a)(i)  of the Agreement authorizes the General 
Partner to cause the Partnership to issue additional interests in the 
Partnership in one or more classes, or one or more series of any of such 
classes, with such designations, preferences and relative, participating, 
optional or other special rights, powers and duties, including rights, powers 
and duties senior to those of the Limited Partners, all as shall be 
determined by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion and 
without the approval of any of the Limited Partners; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that 
any such additional interests in the Partnership must be issued in connection 
with an issuance of shares of or other interests in the General Partner, 
which shares or interests have designations, preferences and other rights, 
all such that the economic interests are substantially similar to the

accordance with SECTION 3.3. OF THE AGREEMENT, and the General Partner shall 
make a capital contribution to the Partnership in an amount equal to the 
proceeds raised in connection with the issuance of such shares of or other 
interests in the General Partner;

     WHEREAS, SECTION 12.1(b)(iii) of the Agreement provides that the General 
Partner has the power, without the consent of the Limited Partners of the

<PAGE>

     WHEREAS, the General Partner has made the determination pursuant to 
SECTION 12.1(b)(iii) of the Agreement that consent of the Limited Partners of 
the Partnership is not required with respect to the matters set forth in this 
Amendment; and

     WHEREAS, all things necessary to make this Amendment a valid agreement 
of the Partnership have been done;

     NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the authority granted to the General Partner 
under the Agreement, the Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

1.   Amendments:

     (a)  Section 2.2 of the Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the 
following new Section 2.2(c) to read as follows:

     (c)  SERIES A PREFERRED UNITS.  The General Partner hereby makes a 
     capital contribution to the Partnership in the amount of the gross 
     proceeds from the sale of the Series A Preferred Shares to Security 
     Capital pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, which amount is 
     $100,000,001.67.  In exchange for such capital contribution, the 
     Partnership hereby issues to the General Partner 3,627,131 Series A 
     Preferred Units, each Series A Preferred Unit representing a capital 
     contribution of $27.57.  Series A Preferred Units shall entitle the 
     General Partner to a Preferred Return, all as described in SECTION 4.1 
     of the Agreement.  Series A Preferred Units shall be converted into 
     Common Units at the time the Series A Preferred Shares are converted 
     into common shares of the General Partner in an amount of Common Units 
     equal to the total amount of such converted common shares divided by the 
     Conversion Factor.  To the extent that Series A Preferred Shares are 
     being redeemed, the General Partner shall be obligated to put to the 
     Partnership a number of Series A Preferred Units equal to the number of 
     Series A Preferred Shares being redeemed or repaid.  Upon putting a 
     Series A Preferred Unit to the Partnership, the General Partner will be 
     paid, in liquidation of each Series A Preferred Unit being put to the 
     Partnership, an amount equal to $27.57 plus any accumulated, accrued and 
     unpaid Series A Preferred Return on such Series A Preferred Unit, PLUS 
     any other amounts owed or to be paid by the General Partner in 
     connection with the redemption of the corresponding Series A Preferred 
     Share; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the General Partner shall not put the 
     Series A Preferred Units to the Partnership if the payment in 
     liquidation of those Series A Preferred Units would cause the 
     Partnership or the General Partner to be in violation of (i) any 
     provision of any agreement with respect to indebtedness, including the 
     Credit and Guaranty Agreement and those agreements with respect to the 
     Convertible Subordinated Debentures (the "Debt Instruments"), or (ii) 
     Section 17-607 of the Act. Before any Series A Preferred Units may be 
     put to the Partnership, the General Partner shall determine in good 
     faith that the redemption of such Series A Preferred Units will not 
     cause a violation of the Debt Instruments

                                       2
<PAGE>

     or Section 17-607 of the Act.  To the extent the General Partner is not 
     permitted to make a payment in respect of the Series A Preferred Shares 
     by reason of a restriction imposed by the Debt Instruments or Section 
     17-607 of the Act, the Partnership shall not, and shall not be obligated 
     to, make any such payment to the General Partner with respect to the 
     corresponding Series A Preferred Units.

     (b)  Section 4.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

          4.1  DISTRIBUTION OF NET CASH FLOW.  The General Partner shall 
     cause the Partnership to distribute all or a portion of Net Cash Flow to 
     the Partners from time to time as determined by the General Partner, but 
     in any event not less frequently than quarterly, in such amounts as the 
     General Partner shall determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
     General Partner shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the 
     Partnership to distribute sufficient amounts to enable the General 
     Partner to pay shareholder dividends that will (a) satisfy the 
     requirements for qualifying as a REIT under the Code and Regulations 
     ("REIT REQUIREMENTS"), and (b) avoid any federal income or excise tax 
     liability of the General Partner.  All amounts withheld pursuant to the 
     Code or a provision of any state or local tax law with respect to any 
     allocation, payment or distribution to the General Partner or any 
     Limited Partner shall be treated as amounts distributed to such Partner. 
     Upon the receipt by the General Partner of each Exercise Notice 
     pursuant to which one or more Redemption Partners exercise Redemption 
     Rights in accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE IX and the 
     Redemption Rights Exhibit, the General Partner shall, unless the General 
     Partner has elected to issue only Shares to such Redemption Partners in 
     respect of the Purchase Price of the Offer Interests, cause the 
     Partnership to distribute to the Partners, PRO RATA in accordance with 
     their respective Percentage Interests as of the date of delivery of such 
     Exercise Notice, all (or such lesser portion as the General Partner 
     shall reasonably determine to be prudent under the circumstances) of Net 
     Cash Flow, which distribution shall be made prior to the closing of the 
     redemption or purchase and sale of the Offered Interests specified in 
     such Exercise Notice.  Subject to any restrictions or limitations 
     imposed by the Debt Instruments or Section 17-607 of the Act, 
     distributions shall be made in accordance with the following order of 
     priority:

               (a)  First, semi-annual distributions to the General Partner 
     with respect to the Preferred Units in an amount equal to the cumulative 
     and unpaid Preferred Return on such Preferred Units in such a way as to 
     allow the General Partner to pay interest and any additional amounts on 
     the Convertible Subordinated Debentures payable to the holders thereof;

               (b)  Second, to the General Partner with respect to the Series 
     A Preferred Units in an amount equal to the cumulative and unpaid Series 
     A Preferred Return on such Series A Preferred Units in such a way as to 
     allow the General Partner to 

                                       3
<PAGE>

     pay cumulative preferential dividends and any additional amounts 
     required on the Series A Preferred Shares payable to the holders 
     thereof; and

               (c)  Next, to the Partners holding Common Units, PRO RATA in 
     accordance with such Partners' then Percentage Interests.

     (c)  The definition of the term "Partnership Interest" contained in the 
Glossary of Defined Terms of the Agreement is hereby amended to read as 
follows:

     "PARTNERSHIP INTEREST" shall mean an ownership interest of a Partner in 
     the Partnership from time to time, including, as applicable, such 
     Partner's Preferred Units, Series A Preferred Units and Percentage 
     Interest and such Partner's Capital Account, and any and all other 
     benefits to which the holder of such Partnership Interest may be 
     entitled as provided in this Agreement, together with all obligations of 
     such Person to comply with the terms of this Agreement.

     (d)  The definition of the term "Partnership Unit" contained in the 
Glossary of Defined Terms of the Agreement is hereby amended to read as 
follows:

     "PARTNERSHIP UNIT" shall mean a Common Unit, Preferred Unit or Series A 
     Preferred Unit and shall constitute a fractional, undivided share of the 
     Partnership Interests corresponding to that particular class of Units.  
     [The allocation of Partnership Units among the Partners as of this date 
     is as set forth on EXHIBIT D.]

     (e)  The definition of the term "Common Unit" contained in the Glossary 
of Defined Terms of the Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

     "COMMON UNIT" shall mean Partnership Interests other than Preferred

     (f)  The Glossary of Defined Terms of the Agreement is hereby amended to 
include the following definitions:

     "SERIES A PREFERRED RETURN" shall mean an amount per Series A Preferred 
     Unit equal to the greater of (i) an annual distribution of $1.84 or (ii) 
     the regular cash distributions on the Common Units, or portion thereof, 
     into which a Series A Preferred Unit is convertible. The Series A 
     Preferred Return will be based on the General Partner's Capital 
     Contribution in respect of the Series A Preferred Units for which the 
     Series A Preferred Return is being determined as provided in the 
     definition of Series A preferred Units below (taking into account any 
     reduction of such Capital Contribution by any redemptions or conversions 
     of such Series A Preferred Units), commencing on the first date such 
     Series A Preferred Units are issued to the General Partner.  It is 
     intended that the Series A Preferred Return will be equal to the 
     dividends and any additional amounts payable on the Series A 

                                       4
<PAGE>

     Preferred Shares to the holders thereof so that the General Partner will 
     receive a Series A Preferred Return in an amount sufficient for the 
     General Partner to make all payments in respect of the Series A 
     Preferred Shares.

     "SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES" shall mean those shares of Series A 
     Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, $.01 par value per 
     share; issued by the General Partner to Security Capital.

     "SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY" shall mean the Series 
     A Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock Articles

     Agreement.  For the purposes of this Agreement, if the proceeds actually 
     received by the General Partner are less than the gross proceeds of the 
     issuance of the Series A Preferred Shares as a result of any 
     underwriter's discount, placement fee or other expenses paid or incurred 
     in connection with such issuance, then the General Partner shall be 
     deemed to have made a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in the 
     amount of the gross proceeds of such issuance and the Partnership shall 
     be deemed simultaneously to have reimbursed the General Partner pursuant 
     to SECTION 6.1 for the amount of such underwriter's discount, placement 
     fee or other expenses.

     (g)  Section 1.1 of Exhibit A (Allocations Exhibit) is hereby amended to

          1.1  ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. The 
     Partnership shall establish and maintain for each Partner a separate 
     account ("CAPITAL ACCOUNT") in accordance with the rules of Regulations 
     Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and this Allocations Exhibit.  The Capital 
     Account of each Partner shall be increased by (i) the amount of all 
     Capital Contributions and any other contributions made by such Partner 
     to the Partnership pursuant to the Agreement, (ii) the amount of Net 
     Income allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section 2.1 of this 
     Allocations Exhibit, and (iii) the amount of any other items of income 
     or gain specially allocated to such Partner pursuant to Article 3 of 
     this Allocations Exhibit.  The Capital Account of each Partner shall be 
     decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Gross Asset Value (net of any 
     liabilities to which such property is subject) of any distributions of 
     cash or property made to such Partner pursuant to the Agreement, (y) the 
     amount of Net Loss allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section 2.2 of 
     this Allocations Exhibit, and (z) the amount of any other items of 
     deduction or loss specially allocated to such Partner pursuant to 
     Article 3 of this Allocations Exhibit.  The Capital Accounts of each 
     Partner shall be increased or

                                       5
<PAGE>

     decreased to reflect the revaluation of Partnership assets under Section 
     1.3 of this Allocations Exhibit.

     (h)  Section 2.1 of Exhibit A (Allocations Exhibit) is hereby amended to 
read as follows:

          2.1  NET INCOME.  After giving effect to the special allocations 
     set forth in Article 3 of this Allocations Exhibit, Net Income for any 
     fiscal year or other applicable period shall be allocated in the 
     following order and priority:

               (a)  First, to the Partners, until the cumulative Net Income 
     allocated pursuant to this subparagraph 2.1(a) for the current and all 
     prior periods equals the cumulative Net Loss allocated pursuant to 
     subparagraphs 2.2(c) and (d) hereof for all prior periods, among the 
     Partners in the reverse order that such Net Loss was allocated (and, in 
     the event of a shift of a Partner's interest in the Partnership, to the 
     Partners in a manner that most equitably reflects the successors in 
     interest of such Partners);

               (b)  Second, to the General Partner, until the cumulative Net 
     Income allocated pursuant to this subparagraph 2.1(b) for the current 
     and all prior periods equals the cumulative Net Loss allocated pursuant 
     to Subparagraph 2.2(b) hereof for all prior periods;

               (c)  Third in respect of its Preferred Units to the General 
     Partner until the cumulative amount of Net Income allocated pursuant to 
     this subparagraph 2.1(c) for the current and all prior periods equals 
     the cumulative Preferred Return on the Preferred Units;

               (d)  Fourth, to the General Partner in respect of the Series A 
     Preferred Units until the cumulative amount of Net Income allocated 
     pursuant to this subparagraph 2.1(d) equals the cumulative Series A 
     Preferred Return on the Series A Preferred Units; and

               (e)  Thereafter, the balance of the Net Income, if any, shall 
     be allocated to the Partners holding Common Units in accordance with 
     their respective Percentage Interests.

     (i)  Section 2.2 of Exhibit A (Allocations Exhibit) is hereby amended to 
read as follows:

          2.2  NET LOSS.  After giving effect to the special allocations set 
     forth in Article 3 of this Allocations Exhibit, Net Loss of the 
     Partnership for each fiscal year or other applicable period shall be 
     allocated as follows:

                                       6
<PAGE>

               (a)  To the Partners holding Common Units in accordance with 
     their respective Percentage Interests until the Capital Accounts of the 
     Limited Partners are all reduced to zero (determined after all capital 
     contributions, distributions, and special allocations under Article III 
     of this Allocations Exhibit allocable to the Partner for the Fiscal Year 
     have been reflected in the Partner's Capital Account).  For these 
     purposes, each Limited Partner's Capital Account shall be increased by 
     such Limited Partner's share of Partnership Minimum Gain and Minimum 
     Gain Attributable to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt for the Fiscal Year;

               (b)  Second, to the General Partner until its Capital Account

     Account shall be increased by the General Partner's share of Partnership 
     Minimum Gain and Minimum Gain Attributable to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt 
     for the Fiscal Year;

               (c)  Thereafter, to the Partners holding Common Units in 
     accordance with their then Percentage Interests; and

               (d)  Notwithstanding preceding provisions of this Section 2.2, 
     to the extent any Net Losses allocated to a Partner under this Section 
     2.2 would cause such Partner (hereinafter, a "RESTRICTED PARTNER") to 
     have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of the fiscal year 
     to which such Losses related, such Losses shall not be allocated to such 
     Restricted Partners and instead shall be allocated to the other 
     Partner(s) (herein, the "PERMITTED PARTNERS") PRO RATA in accordance 
     with their relative Partnership Interests.

     (j)  Section 5 of EXHIBIT A (Allocations Exhibit) is hereby amended by 
deleting the definitions for the following terms: "Common Capital Account" 
and GP Subaccount."

1.   Amendments:

     (a)  Section 3.4 of the Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in SECTION 3.3, the General 
     Partner may from time to time advance funds to the Partnership for any 
     proper Partnership purpose as a loan ("FUNDING LOAN") or a preferred 
     equity investment ("PREFERRED INVESTMENT"), provided that any such funds

     any indebtedness for borrowed funds, except for (i) Funding Loans or 
     Preferred Investments, (ii) loans from the Partnership to the General 
     Partner to the extent the proceeds thereof are used to fund, directly or

     property interests for the account of the General Partner if, and only 
     if, the Partnership participates or acquires an interest in such 
     property at least to the extent of 99 times such proposed participation 
     or acquisition, directly or through a wholly-owned entity, by the 
     General Partner and/or (iii) loans from the Partnership to the General

     The General Partner agrees that all business activities of the General 
     Partner, including activities pertaining to the acquisition, development 
     and ownership of Properties, shall be conducted through the Partnership 
     (other than the General Partner's 1% interest in Existing Property 
     Partnerships owned directly or through a wholly-owned corporation); 
     PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the General Partner shall be permitted to 
     participate or acquire an interest in, directly or indirectly, any real 
     or personal property for its own account if, and only if, the 
     Partnership participates or acquires an interest in such property at 
     least to the extent of 99 times such proposed participation or 
     acquisition, directly or through a wholly-owned corporation, by the 
     General Partner.  The Company agrees that for so long as it is a Partner 
     all borrowings for the purpose of making distributions to its 
     stockholders will be incurred by the Partnership or the Property 
     Partnerships (and not by the Company directly) and the proceeds of such 
     indebtedness will be included as Net Financing Proceeds hereunder.  For 
     purposes of this Section 6.4, participations in or acquisitions of any 
     real estate or personal property interests shall include ownership 
     through one or more tiers of partnerships, joint ventures, limited

Company and Operating Partnership on a full-time basis for a period of nine 
months as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness which is 
determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company

withheld unreasonably).  "Incapacity" as used herein shall be limited only to 
a condition that substantially prevents Employee from performing his duties 
hereunder.

the Company and Operating Partnership may terminate Employee's employment 
only for Cause or for breach of the provisions of Section IX 
(Antisolicitation) or XII (Confidential Information) or as set forth in 
paragraph A above.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean that 
the Company and Operating Partnership, acting in good faith based upon the 
information then known to the Company and the Operating Partnership, 
determine that Employee has: (1) failed to perform in a material respect his 
obligations under this Agreement without proper cause, (2) been convicted of 
a felony, or (3) committed a material act of fraud, dishonesty or gross 
misconduct which is materially injurious to the Company or the Operating 
Partnership.

        C.  OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY UPON TERMINATION.  

            1.  DEATH OR DISABILITY.  If Employee's employment is terminated 
        by reason of Employee's Death or Disability, the term of this 
        Agreement shall not be subject to any further extension pursuant to 
        Section II hereof.  During the remainder of the term of this 
        Agreement (as in effect on the date of Employee's termination of 
        employment), the Company and the Operating Partnership (a) shall 
        continue to pay to Employee (or, in the case of his death, his 
        surviving spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, his estate) 
        Employee's annual base salary at the same time and in the same manner 
        as if he had continued to perform services under this Agreement and 
        (b) shall provide any coverage required by law and shall continue to 
        provide to Employee (or, in the case of his death, his surviving 
        spouse) the same level of health insurance provided to other 
        executives of the Company and the Operating Partnership.  Executive 
        acknowledges and agrees that the Company and the Operating 
        Partnership may insure themselves for their financial obligations 
        upon Employee's death.  Employee agrees to subject himself to medical 
        examinations as may be reasonably required for such purposes. 

            2.  CAUSE.  If Employee's employment is terminated by the Company 
        and the Operating Partnership pursuant to Section V-B, this Agreement 
        shall terminate without further obligations to Employee other than 
        for (a) payment of the sum of Employee's annual base salary through 
        the date of termination and any accrued vacation pay to the extent 
        not theretofore paid, which shall be paid to Employee or his estate 
        or beneficiary, as applicable, in a lump sum in cash within 30 days 
        of the date of termination; (b) payment of any compensation 
        previously deferred by Employee (together with any accrued interest 
        or earnings thereon), which 

                                      5
<PAGE>

        shall be paid to Employee or his estate or beneficiary pursuant to 
        terms of the plan or agreement under which such compensation was 
        deferred; and (c) payment to Employee or his estate or beneficiary, 
        as applicable, any amounts due pursuant to the terms of any 
        applicable welfare benefit plans.  The payments described in clauses 
        (a) and (b) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Accrued 
        Obligations."  If it is subsequently determined that the Company and 
        the Operating Partnership did not have Cause for termination under 
        this Section V-C-2, then the Company's and the Operating 
        Partnership's decision to terminate shall be deemed to have been made 
        under Section V-C-3 and the amounts payable thereunder shall be the 
        only amounts Employee may receive for his termination.

            3.  OTHER THAN CAUSE OR DEATH OR DISABILITY.  If the Company and 
        the Operating Partnership breach this Agreement by terminating 
        Employee's employment other than pursuant to Section V-B, then (a) 
        the Company shall immediately pay to Employee a lump sum equal to 
        three times Employee's base salary for one year at the rate in effect 
        immediately prior to Employee's termination of employment, less 
        standard withholdings and other authorized deductions, (b) the 
        Company shall timely pay to Employee the Accrued Obligations, (c) the 
        restrictions on the shares granted pursuant to the Restricted Stock 
        Award shall immediately lapse (subject to limitations on acceleration 
        of exercisability and vesting under the Plan and the Restricted Stock 
        Award Agreement), and (d) the Stock Option Award shall become 
        immediately exercisable in full (subject to limitations on 
        acceleration of exercisability and vesting under the Plan and the 
        Stock Option Agreement).  None of the payments provided in this 
        Section V-C-3 shall be reduced by any amounts earned or received by 
        Employee from a third party at any time.

            4.  EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.  Employee agrees that the payments 
        contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute the exclusive and 
        sole remedy for any termination of his employment and Employee 
        covenants not to assert or pursue any other remedies, at law or in 
        equity, with respect to any termination of employment.

VI.     CHANGE IN CONTROL.

        A.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a 
Change in Control (as defined below) of Macerich occurs during the term of 
this Agreement, and if within two years after the Change in Control the 
Company and the Operating Partnership terminate Employee's employment for a 
reason other than Cause, or if employee terminates his employment for Good 
Reason (as defined below), the provisions of Section V.C.3 and V.C.4 shall 
apply.

                                      6

        B.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any 
"parachute payments" to be made to or for Employee's benefit, whether 
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, shall be modified to the extent 
necessary so that the requirements of one of the two subparagraphs below are 
satisfied:

            1.  The aggregate "present value" of all "parachute payments" 
        payable to Employee or for Employee's benefit, whether pursuant to 
        this Agreement or otherwise, shall be less than three (3) times 
        Employee's "base amount"; or

            2.  Each "parachute payment" payable to Employee or for 
        Employee's benefit, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, 
        shall be in an amount which does not exceed the "reasonable 
        compensation" allocable to such "parachute payment."

        the surviving or resulting entity immediately after the 
        reorganization are, or will be, owned, directly or indirectly, by 
        shareholders or other affiliates of Macerich immediately before such 
        reorganization (assuming for purposes of such determination that 
        there is no change in the record ownership of Macerich's securities 
        from the record date for such approval until such reorganization but 
        including in such determination any securities of the other parties 
        to such reorganization held by affiliates of Macerich);

            (3) Approval by the shareholders of Macerich of the sale of 
        substantially all of Macerich's business and/or assets to a person or 
        entity which is not a Macerich Entity or an affiliate of a Macerich 
        Entity; or

        thereunder) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 
        under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of 
        Macerich representing more than 20% of the combined voting power of 
        Macerich's then outstanding securities entitled to then vote 
        generally in the election of directors of the Macerich, other than a 
        person who is the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under 
        the Exchange Act) of more than 10% of the outstanding shares of 
        Common Stock at the time of adoption of this Agreement, or an 
        affiliate, successor, heir, descendant or related party of or to any 
        such person.

            2.  "Good Reason" shall mean (a) an adverse and significant

        in Employee's base salary, or (e) any breach of this Agreement by the 
        Company or the Operating Partnership.

            3.  The term "base amount" shall have the meaning ascribed to it 
        under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
        amended (the "Code");

            4.  The term "parachute payment" shall have the meaning ascribed 
        in Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code, without regard to Section 
        280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Code but with regard to Section 
        280G(b)(4)(A);

            5.  "Present value" shall be determined in accordance with 
        Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code;

            6.  The term "reasonable compensation" shall have the meaning 
        ascribed to it under Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code (for personal 
        services actually rendered before the date of the Change in Control 
        of Macerich); and

            7.  The portion of the "base amount" and the amount of

constitute

                                      8
<PAGE>

"parachute payments," then notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of 
any other existing agreement to the contrary, Employee may by written notice 
to the Company and the Operating Partnership designate the order in which 
such "parachute payments" shall be reduced or modified so that the Company 
and the Operating Partnership or either of them is not denied federal income 
tax deductions for any "parachute payments" because of Section 280G of the 
Code.

        E.  All determinations required by this Section VI, including without 
limitation the determination of whether any benefit or payment would 
constitute a parachute payment, the calculation of the value of any parachute 
and whether any benefit or payment constitutes reasonable compensation, shall 
be made by an independent accounting firm (other than Macerich's outside 
auditing firm) having nationally recognized expertise in such matters 
selected by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Macerich. 
Any such determination by such accounting firm shall be binding on the 
Company, the Operating Partnership and Employee.

        F.  Payment of amounts pursuant to this Agreement shall not, unless 
directed by Employee, be delayed pending determination of the status of a 
payment as a "parachute payment" by the Internal Revenue Service, court or 
similar body of competent jurisdiction.

                             THE MACERICH COMPANY

                             1994 INCENTIVE PLAN

                    (AS AMENDED EFFECTIVE APRIL 8, 1997)

I.    THE PLAN.

      1.1  PURPOSE.

           The purpose of this Plan is to promote the success of the Company 
and the interests of its stockholders by providing an additional means 
through the grant of Awards to attract, motivate, retain and reward 
employees, including officers, by providing them long-term incentives to 
improve the financial performance of the Company.  "Corporation" means The 
Macerich Company, a Maryland corporation, and its successors, and "Company" 
means the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, collectively.  These terms and 
other capitalized terms are defined in Article VII.

      1.2  ADMINISTRATION AND AUTHORIZATION; POWER AND PROCEDURE.

           (a)  COMMITTEE.  This Plan shall be administered by and all Awards 
to Eligible Persons shall be authorized by the Committee.  Action of the 
Committee with respect to the administration of this Plan shall be taken 
pursuant to a majority vote or by written consent of its members.  Where the 
Committee authorizes the issuance of shares for consideration other than 
money, the Committee shall adopt a resolution which fairly describes such 
consideration and states (i) its actual value as determined by the Committee; 
or (ii) that the Committee has determined that the actual value is or will be 
not less than a certain sum.

           (b)  PLAN AWARDS; INTERPRETATION; POWERS OF COMMITTEE. Subject to 
the express provisions of this Plan, the Committee shall have the authority:

           (i)    to determine the particular Eligible Persons who will 
      receive Awards;

          (ii)    to grant, directly or indirectly through its Subsidiaries, 
      Awards to Eligible Persons, determine the price at which securities 
      will be offered or awarded and the amount of securities to be offered 
      or awarded to any of such persons, and determine the other specific 
      terms and conditions of such Awards consistent with the express limits 
      of this Plan, and establish the installments (if any) in which such 
      Awards shall become exercisable or shall vest, or determine that no 
      delayed

                                        1
<PAGE>

      exercisability or vesting is required, and establish the events of 
      termination or reversion of such Awards;

         (iii)    to approve the forms of Award Agreements (which need not be 
      identical either as to type of award or among Participants);

          (iv)    to construe and interpret this Plan and any agreements 
      defining the rights and obligations of the Company and Participants 
      under this Plan, further define the terms used in this Plan, and 
      prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the 
      administration of this Plan;

           (v)    to cancel, modify, or waive the Corporation's rights with 
      respect to, or modify, discontinue, suspend, or terminate any or all 
      outstanding Awards held by Eligible Persons, subject to any required 
      consent under Section 6.6;

          (vi)    to accelerate the exercisability or the vesting of any 
      Awards under such circumstances as the Committee shall determine, 
      including a Change in Control Event, or to extend the exercisability or 
      extend the term of any or all such outstanding Awards within the term 
      limits on Awards under Section 1.6; and

         (vii)   to make all other determinations and take such other action 
      as contemplated by this Plan or as may be necessary or advisable for 
      the administration of this Plan and the effectuation of its purposes.

           (c)  BINDING DETERMINATIONS.  Any action taken by, or inaction of, 
the Corporation, any Subsidiary, the Board or the Committee relating or 
pursuant to this Plan shall be within the absolute discretion of that entity 
or body and shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons.  No member of 
the Board or Committee, or officer of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, 
shall be liable for any such action or inaction of the entity or body, of 
another person or, except in circumstances involving bad faith, of himself or 
herself.  Subject only to compliance with the express provisions hereof, the 
Board and Committee may act in their absolute discretion in matters within 
their authority related to this Plan.

           (d)  RELIANCE ON EXPERTS.  In making any determination or in 
taking or not taking any action under this Plan, the Committee or the Board, 
as the case may be, may obtain and may rely upon the advice of experts, 
including employees of and professional advisors to the Corporation.  No 
director, officer or agent of the Company shall be liable for any such action 
or determination taken or made or omitted in good faith.

                                        2
<PAGE>

           (e)  DELEGATION.  The Committee may delegate ministerial, 
non-discretionary functions to individuals who are officers or employees of 
the Company.

      1.3  PARTICIPATION.

           Awards may be granted by the Committee only to those persons that 
the Committee determines to be Eligible Persons.  An Eligible Person who has 
been granted an Award may, if otherwise eligible, be granted additional 
Awards if the Committee shall so determine subject to the limitations 
otherwise provided in this Plan.

      1.4  SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARDS; SHARE LIMITS.

           Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2, the stock that may be 
delivered under this Plan shall be shares of the Corporation's authorized but 
unissued Common Stock.  The shares may be delivered for any lawful 
consideration, but not for less than the minimum lawful consideration under 
applicable state law.

           (a)  NUMBER OF SHARES.  The maximum number of shares of Common 
Stock that may be delivered pursuant to Awards granted to Eligible Persons 
under this Plan shall not exceed 2,550,000 shares, plus 9.9% of any increase 
in the total outstanding shares of the Company after March 31, 1997 (other 
than an increase as a result of the issuance of shares under this Plan), 
subject to adjustments contemplated by Section 6.2.  The Plan share limit may 
not contract if shares are reacquired by the Company after an increase has 
been made, but neither shall the limit increase if the reacquired shares are 
reissued.

           (b)  CALCULATION OF AVAILABLE SHARES AND REPLENISHMENT. Shares 
subject to outstanding Awards shall be reserved for issuance.  If any Option 
or other right to acquire shares of Common Stock under or receive cash or 
shares in respect of an Award shall expire or be cancelled or terminated 
without having been exercised or paid in full, or any Common Stock subject to 
a Restricted Stock Award or other Award shall not vest or be delivered, the 
unpurchased, unvested or undelivered shares of Common Stock subject thereto 
shall again be available for the purposes of this Plan, subject only to any 
applicable limitations for the preservation of deductibility under Section 
162(m) of the Code.

           (c)  PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN STOCK-BASED CASH AWARDS. The number of 
stock-related Awards actually paid in cash shall be determined by reference 
to the number of shares by which the value or price of the Award is measured 
and shall not, together with the aggregate number of shares theretofore 
delivered and shares subject to then outstanding Awards payable in shares (or 
alternatively payable in cash or shares) under this Plan, exceed

                                        3
<PAGE>

the aggregate or applicable individual limits of Section 1.4, subject to 
adjustments under this Section 1.4 and Section 6.2.

           (d)  ISO LIMIT.  The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that 
may be issued under Incentive Stock Options under the Plan shall not exceed 
1,950,000 shares.

           (e)  INDIVIDUAL LIMITS.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein 
to the contrary, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to 
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") granted during any calendar 
year to any individual shall be limited to 300,000, and the maximum 
individual limit on the number of shares in the aggregate subject to all 
stock-related Awards under this Plan granted during any calendar year shall 
be 500,000, subject to adjustments under Section 6.2.

           (f)  DIRECTOR LIMITS.  The maximum number of shares that may be 
issued under Awards under this Plan that are granted to any director who is 
not as of the applicable date or dates of grant an employee or officer shall 
be 50,000, subject to adjustments under Section 6.2.  Any Award issued to a 
member of the Committee shall be subject to approval or ratification by the 
Board.

      1.5  GRANT OF AWARDS.

           Subject to the express provisions of this Plan, the Committee 
shall determine those individuals who are Eligible Persons, the number of 
shares of Common Stock subject to each Award, the price (if any) to be paid 
for the shares or the Award and the other terms of the Award.  Each Award 
shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement signed by the Corporation and, if 
required by the Committee, by the Participant.  Each Award shall be subject 
to the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan and such other terms and 
conditions established by the Committee as are not inconsistent with the 
specific provisions of this Plan.  

      1.6  AWARD PERIOD.

           Any Option, SAR, warrant or similar right shall expire and any 
other Award shall either vest or be forfeited not more than 10 years after 
the date of grant; provided, however, that any payment of cash or delivery of 
stock pursuant to an Award may be delayed until a future date if specifically 
authorized by the Committee in writing.

      1.7  LIMITATIONS ON EXERCISE AND VESTING OF AWARDS.

           (a)  PROVISIONS FOR EXERCISE.  Unless the Committee otherwise 
provides, once exercisable an Award shall remain exercisable until the 
expiration or earlier termination of the Award.  Unless the Committee 
otherwise provides, Options shall

                                        4
<PAGE>

first become exercisable in three equal annual installments, commencing on 
the first anniversary of the Award Date.

           (b)  PROCEDURE.  Any exercisable Award shall be deemed to be 
exercised when the Corporation receives written notice of such exercise from 
the Participant, together with any required payment made in accordance with 
Section 2.2.

           (c)  FRACTIONAL SHARES/MINIMUM ISSUE.  Fractional share interests 
shall be disregarded, but may be accumulated.  The Committee, however, may 
determine in the case of Eligible Persons that cash, other securities, or 
other property will be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional share 
interests.  No fewer than 100 shares may be purchased on exercise of any 
Award at one time unless the number purchased is the total number at the time 
available for purchase under the Award.

      1.8  NOTES TO FINANCE EXERCISE OR PURCHASE.

           If the Committee, in its sole discretion approves, and subject to 
Section 6.4, the Corporation may accept one or more notes from any Eligible 
Person (i) in connection with the exercise, receipt or vesting of any 
outstanding Award or (ii) in such other circumstances to facilitate the 
purchase of stock by an eligible employee or officer as the Committee 
determines to be reasonably expected to benefit the Corporation; provided 
that any such note shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

           (a)  The principal of the note shall not exceed the amount 
required to be paid to the Corporation upon the exercise or receipt of one or 
more Awards under this Plan and the note shall be delivered directly to the 
Corporation in consideration of such exercise or receipt.

           (b)  The initial term of the note shall be determined by the 
Committee; provided that the term of the note, including extensions, shall 
not exceed ten(10) years.

           (c)  The note shall provide for full recourse to the Participant 
and shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Committee but not less 
than the interest rate necessary to avoid the imputation of interest under 
the Code.

           (d)  The unpaid principal balance of the note shall become due and 
payable on the 10th business day after Termination of Employment of the 
Participant; provided, however, that if a sale of the shares financed by the 
note would cause such Participant to incur liability under Section 16(b) of 
the Exchange Act, the unpaid balance shall become due and payable on the 10th 
business day after the first day on which a sale of such shares could have 
been made without incurring such liability, assuming for these purposes that 
there are no other transactions

                                        5
<PAGE>

(or deemed transactions) in securities of this Corporation by the Participant 
subsequent to such termination.

           (e)  In the case of a note issued other than in connection with 
the receipt, exercise or vesting of another Award or in any case if required 
by the Committee or by applicable law, (i) the note shall be secured by a 
pledge of any shares or rights financed thereby (and such other collateral as 
may be required by the Committee), and (ii) the maximum principal amount of 
the note may not exceed $1,000,000.

           (f)  The terms, repayment provisions, and collateral release 
provisions of the note and the pledge securing the note shall conform with 
applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board as then in 
effect.

      1.9  NO TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS; LIMITED EXCEPTIONS.

           Awards may be exercised only by, and amounts payable or shares 
issuable pursuant to an Award shall be paid only to (or registered only in 
the name of), the Participant or, if the Participant has died, the 
Participant's Beneficiary or, if the Participant has suffered a Disability, 
the Participant's Personal Representative, if any, or if there is none, the 
Participant, or, (except in the case of Incentive Stock Options) to the 
extent expressly permitted by the Committee and applicable law to such 
persons and pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Committee may 
establish.  Other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or 
(except in the case of Incentive Stock Options) as the Committee may 
otherwise expressly permit, no right or benefit under this Plan or any Award 
(other than shares issued without further restrictions) shall be 
transferrable by the Participant or shall be subject in any manner to 
anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or 
charge (other than to the Corporation) and any such attempted action shall be 
void.  The Corporation shall disregard any attempt at transfer, assignment or 
other alienation prohibited by the preceding sentences and shall pay or 
deliver such cash or shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions 
of this Plan.  The designation of a Beneficiary for purposes hereof shall not 
constitute a transfer for these purposes.

II.  EMPLOYEE OPTIONS.

      2.1  GRANTS.

           One or more Options may be granted under this Article to any 
Eligible Person.  Each Option granted shall be designated by the Committee in 
the applicable Award Agreement as either a Nonqualified Stock Option or an 
Incentive Stock Option. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the 
contrary,

                                        6
<PAGE>

Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Eligible Persons who are 
employed by the Corporation or a corporation which is either a direct 
Subsidiary of the Corporation or an indirect Subsidiary through an unbroken 
chain of corporations.

      2.2  OPTION PRICE.

           (a)  PRICING LIMITS.  The purchase price per share of the Common 
Stock covered by each Option shall be determined by the Committee at the time 
of the Award, PROVIDED that such price shall be no less than 100% (110% in 
the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant described in 
Section 2.4) of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of 
grant.  The base price of each stock appreciation right shall be determined 
by the Committee at the time of the Award.  The base price of an SAR granted 
after the grant of an Option may be less than the Fair Market Value of Common 
Stock at the date of grant of the SAR, but if so, may not be less than the 
Option exercise price.

           (b)  PAYMENT PROVISIONS.  The purchase price of any shares 
purchased on exercise of an Option granted under this Article shall be paid 
in full at the time of each purchase in one or a combination of the following 
methods: (i) in cash or by electronic funds transfer; (ii) by certified or 
cashier's check payable to the order of the Corporation; (iii) if authorized 
by the Committee or specified in the applicable Award Agreement, by a 
promissory note of the Participant consistent with the requirements of 
Section 1.8; or (iv) by the delivery of shares of Common Stock of the 
Corporation already owned by the Participant, provided, however, that the 
Committee may in its absolute discretion limit the Participant's ability to 
exercise an Award by delivering such shares, and any shares delivered which 
were initially acquired upon exercise of a share option must have been owned 
by the Participant at least six months as of the date of delivery.  Shares of 
Common Stock used to satisfy the exercise price of an Option shall be valued 
at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise.  In addition to the 
payment methods described above, the Committee may provide that the Option 
can be exercised and payment made by delivering a properly executed exercise 
notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver 
to the Corporation the amount of sale proceeds necessary to pay the exercise 
price and, unless otherwise allowed by the Committee, any applicable tax 
withholding under Section 6.5.  The Corporation shall not be obligated to 
deliver certificates for the shares unless and until it receives full payment 
of the exercise price therefor and any related withholding obligations have 
been satisfied.

      2.3  LIMITATIONS ON GRANT AND TERMS OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS.

           (a)  $100,000 LIMIT.  To the extent that the aggregate 

                                        7
<PAGE>

Fair Market Value of stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options 
first become exercisable by a Participant in any calendar year exceeds 
$100,000, taking into account both Common Stock subject to incentive stock 
options (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) under this Plan and stock 
subject to incentive stock options under all other plans of the Corporation 
or its Subsidiaries, if any, such options shall be treated as Nonqualified 
Stock Options.  For this purpose, the Fair Market Value of the stock subject 
to options shall be determined as of the date the options were awarded.  In 
reducing the number of options treated as incentive stock options to meet the 
$100,000 limit, the most recently granted options shall be reduced first. To 
the extent a reduction of simultaneously granted options is necessary to meet 
the $100,000 limit, the Committee may, in the manner and to the extent 
permitted by law, designate which shares of Common Stock are to be treated as 
shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option.

           (b)  OPTION PERIOD.  Each Option and all rights thereunder shall 
expire no later than 10 years after the Award Date.

           (c)  OTHER CODE LIMITS.  There shall be imposed in any Award 
Agreement relating to Incentive Stock Options such terms and conditions as 
from time to time are required in order that the Option be an "incentive 
stock option" as that term is defined in Section 422 of the Code.

      2.4  LIMITS ON 10% HOLDERS.

           No Incentive Stock Option may be granted to any person who, at the 
time the Option is granted, owns (or is deemed to own under Section 424(d) of 
the Code) shares of outstanding Common Stock possessing more than 10% of the 
total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation or a 
Subsidiary, unless the exercise price of such Option is at least 110% of the 
Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Option and such Option by its 
terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date 
such Option is granted.

      2.5  AWARD CHANGES/LIMITS ON REPRICING.

           Subject to Section 1.4, Section 6.2 and Section 6.6 and the 
specific limitations on Awards contained in this Plan, the Committee from 
time to time may authorize, generally or in specific cases only, for the 
benefit of any Eligible Person any adjustment in the vesting schedule, the 
number of shares subject to, the restrictions upon or the term of, an Award 
granted under this Article, by amendment, by substitution, by waiver or by 
other legally valid means.  Subject to Section 1.4, Section 6.2 and Section 
6.6 and the specific limitations on Awards contained in this Plan, such 
amendment or other action may, among other changes, provide for a greater or 
lesser number of shares subject

                                        8
<PAGE>

to the Award, or provide for a longer or shorter vesting or exercise period.  
Subject to Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 and the specific limitations on Awards 
contained in this Plan, the Committee also may reduce the exercise or 
purchase price of any or all outstanding Awards as deemed appropriate by the 
Committee, provided that the Committee does not reduce the exercise price of 
any Option or related SAR to a price below the Fair Market Value of the 
Option on the date of its grant.

      2.6  LIMITATION ON EXERCISE OF OPTION AWARD.

           No Participant may receive Common Stock upon exercise of an Option 
to the extent that it will cause such person to Beneficially or 
Constructively Own Equity Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit.

           In the event that a Participant exercises any portion of an Option 
(by tendering the exercise price to the Corporation) which upon delivery of 
the Common Stock would cause the holder of the Option to Beneficially or 
Constructively Own Equity Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit, the 
Corporation shall have the right to deliver to the Participant, in lieu of 
Common Stock, a check or cash in the amount equal to the Fair Market Value of 
the Common Stock otherwise deliverable on the date of exercise (minus any 
amounts withheld pursuant to Section 6.5).

III. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

      3.1  GRANTS.

           In its discretion, the Committee may grant to any Eligible Person 
SARs concurrently with the grant of Options or thereafter, including in the 
circumstances of a Change in Control Event, on such terms as set forth by the 
Committee in the Award Agreement for such Option or such SARs.  Unless the 
Committee with the consent of the Participant otherwise determines, any SAR 
granted in connection with an Incentive Stock Option shall contain such terms 
as may be required to comply with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code 
and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

      3.2  EXERCISE OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

           (a)  EXERCISABILITY.  Unless the Award Agreement or the Committee 
otherwise provides, a SAR shall be exercisable at such time or times, and to 
the extent, that the related Option shall be exercisable and only when the 
Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the related Option exceeds the 
Option price of the related Option.

           (b)  EFFECT ON AVAILABLE SHARES.  To the extent that a SAR is 
exercised, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to

                                        9
<PAGE>

the related Option shall be charged against the maximum amount of Common 
Stock that may be delivered pursuant to Awards under this Plan.  The number 
of shares subject to the SAR and the related Option of the Participant shall 
also be reduced by such number of shares.

           (c)  NON-PROPORTIONATE REDUCTION.  If a SAR extends to less than 
all the shares covered by the related Option and if a portion of the related 
Option is thereafter exercised, the number of shares subject to the 
unexercised SAR shall be reduced only if and to the extent that the remaining 
number of shares covered by such related Option is less then the remaining 
number of shares subject to such SAR, unless the Committee otherwise provides.

      3.3  PAYMENT.

           (a)  AMOUNT.  Unless the Committee otherwise provides, upon 
exercise of a SAR and surrender of an exercisable portion of any related 
Option to the extent required by Section 3.2, the Participant shall be 
entitled to receive, subject to Section 6.5, payment of an amount determined 
by multiplying

           (i)    the difference obtained by subtracting the exercise price 
      per share of Common Stock under the related Option from the Fair Market 
      Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR, by

           (ii)   the number of shares with respect to which the SAR shall 
      have been exercised.

If an SAR is granted as a Performance Based Award under Section 5.2 without 
reference to any performance criterion other than stock price appreciation, 
the base price shall be not less than the Fair Market Value at date of grant.

           (b)  FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, 
shall determine the form in which payment shall be made of the amount 
determined under paragraph (a) above, either solely in cash, solely in shares 
of Common Stock (valued at Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the 
SAR), or partly in such shares and partly in cash, PROVIDED that the 
Committee shall have determined that such exercise and payment are consistent 
with applicable law.  If the Committee permits the Participant to elect to 
receive cash or shares (or a combination thereof) on such exercise, any such 
election shall be subject to such conditions as the Committee may impose.  
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Participant may 
receive Common Stock upon the exercise of a SAR to the extent it will cause 
such person to Beneficially or Constructively Own Equity Shares in excess of 
the Ownership Limit.  In the event that a Participant exercises any portion 
of a SAR which upon delivery of Common Stock would cause such Participant to 
Beneficially or Constructively Own Equity Shares in excess of the Ownership

                                        10
<PAGE>

Limit, the Corporation shall have the right, notwithstanding any election 
granted to the Participant by the Committee, to deliver a check or cash to 
the Participant.

IV.  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.

      4.1  GRANTS.

           Subject to the Restricted Stock limits set forth in Section 
4.2(e), the Committee may, in its discretion, grant one or more Restricted 
Stock Awards to any Eligible Person based upon such factors (which in the 
case of any Award to a Section 16 Person shall include but not be limited to 
the contributions, responsibilities and other compensation of the person) as 
the Committee shall deem relevant in light of the specific terms of the 
Award.  Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement shall specify the number of 
shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Participant, the date of such 
issuance, the consideration for such shares (but not less than the minimum 
lawful consideration under applicable state law) by the Participant, the 
restrictions imposed on such shares and the conditions of release or lapse of 
such restrictions, which may include performance criteria, continued 
employment for a specified period of time and/or other factors.  Such 
restrictions shall not lapse earlier than one year after the Award Date, 
except as set forth in Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 and to the extent the 
Committee may otherwise provide.  Shares of Restricted Stock may be issued in 
the form of book entries or stock certificates, each registered in the name 
of the Participant ("Restricted Shares").  Stock certificates or book entry 
records evidencing shares of Restricted Stock pending the lapse of the 
restrictions shall bear an appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed 
hereunder.  Restricted Shares shall be held (if in certificate form) and 
restricted as to transfer until the restrictions have lapsed and such shares 
have vested in accordance with the provisions of the Award Agreement and this 
Plan.  Upon issuance of the Restricted Stock Award, the Participant may be 
required to provide such further assurance and documents as the Committee may 
require to enforce the restrictions.

      4.2  RESTRICTIONS.

           (a)  PERFORMANCE VESTING.  The vesting of shares pursuant to a 
Restricted Stock Award may be based solely upon the continued employment for 
a specific period of time or the degree of attainment, over a specified 
period as may be established by the Committee, of such measure(s) of the 
performance of the Company (or any part thereof) or the Participant's 
performance, or upon any combination thereof, as may be established by the 
Committee.  Performance-based or accelerating Restricted Stock Awards may 
also be granted under Section 5.2.

                                        11
<PAGE>

           (b)  PRE-VESTING RESTRAINTS.  Except as provided in and subject to 
the provisions of Sections 4.1 and 1.9, Restricted Shares comprising any 
Restricted Stock Award may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or 
otherwise disposed of or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily, 
until such shares have vested.

           (c)  DIVIDEND AND VOTING RIGHTS.  Unless otherwise provided in the 
applicable Award Agreement, a Participant receiving a Restricted Stock Award 
shall be entitled to cash dividend and voting rights for all shares issued 
even though they are not vested, provided that all such rights shall 
terminate immediately as to any restricted shares which cease to be eligible 
for vesting.

           (d)  CASH PAYMENTS.  If the Participant shall have paid cash in 
connection with the Restricted Stock Award, the Award Agreement shall specify 
whether and to what extent such cash shall be returned (with or without an 
earnings factor) as to any restricted shares which cease to be eligible for 
vesting.

      4.3  RETURN TO THE CORPORATION.

           Unless the Committee otherwise expressly provides, Restricted 
Shares that are subject to restrictions at the time of Termination of 
Employment or are subject to other conditions to vesting that have not been 
satisfied by the time specified in the applicable Award Agreement shall not 
vest and shall be returned to the Corporation in such manner and on such 
terms as the Committee shall therein provide.

V.    STOCK BONUSES, OTHER CASH OR STOCK PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS,
      STOCK UNITS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS.

      5.1  GRANTS OF STOCK BONUSES.

           The Committee may grant a Stock Bonus to any Eligible Person to 
reward exceptional or special services, contributions or achievements in the 
manner and on such terms and conditions (including any restrictions on such 
shares) as determined from time to time by the Committee.  The number of 
shares so awarded shall be determined by the Committee; provided, however, in 
no case may a Stock Bonus be granted to the extent that it will cause an 
Eligible Person to Beneficially or Constructively Own Equity Shares in excess 
of the Ownership Limit.  The Award may be granted independently or in lieu of 
a cash bonus.

      5.2  OTHER PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS.

           (a) GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing, and in addition to qualifying awards

                                        12
<PAGE>

granted under other provisions of this Plan (i.e. Options or SARs granted 
with an exercise price not less than Fair Market Value at the applicable date 
of grant for Section 162(m) purposes to Eligible Persons who are either 
salaried employees or officers ("ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES") ("Presumptively 
Qualifying Awards")), the Committee may authorize and grant to any Eligible 
Employee, other cash or stock-related performance-based awards, including 
"performance-based" awards within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code 
("PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS"), whether in the form of restricted stock, stock 
appreciation rights, performance stock, phantom stock, stock units, Dividend 
Equivalent Rights ("DERs"), or other rights, whether or not related to stock 
values or appreciation, and whether payable in cash, Common Stock or a 
combination thereof.  If the Award (other than a Presumptively Qualifying 
Award) is intended as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of 
the Code, the vesting or payment thereof will depend on the performance of 
the Company on a consolidated, Subsidiary, segment, or division basis with 
reference to performance goals relative to one or more of the following 
business criteria (the "criterion"):  funds from operations, EBITDA, stock 
appreciation, total stockholder return, occupancy gains, and overall square 
footage growth, each as defined in Exhibit A.  These terms otherwise are used 
as applied under generally accepted accounting principles and in the 
Company's financial reporting.  To qualify Awards as performance-based under 
Section 162(m), the applicable business criteria and specific performance 
goal or goals ("targets") must be established and approved by the Committee 
during the first 90 days of the year (or before one-quarter of the 
performance measurement period has elapsed, if such period exceeds one year) 
and while the performance relating to such targets remains substantially 
uncertain within the meaning thereof.  The applicable performance measurement 
period may be not less than one nor (except as provided in Section 1.6) more 
than 10 years.

           (b)  MAXIMUM AWARD.  Grants or awards under this Section 5.2 may 
be paid in cash or stock or any combination thereof.  In no event shall 
grants of stock-related Awards made in any calendar year to any Eligible 
Employee under this Plan relate to more than 500,000 shares.  In no event 
shall grants to any Eligible Employee under this Plan of Awards payable only 
in cash and not related to stock provide for payment of more than (x) the 
lesser of 200% of base salary as of the beginning of the applicable 
performance period or $600,000, times (y) the applicable number of years (not 
more than 10) to which the Awards relate in the performance periods.  

           (c)  COMMITTEE CERTIFICATION.  Except as otherwise permitted to 
qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), before any 
Performance-Based Award under this Section 5.2 is paid, the Committee must 
certify that the performance standard, target(s), and the other material 
terms of the Performance-Based Award were in fact satisfied.

                                        13
<PAGE>

           (d)  TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AWARDS.  The Committee will have 
discretion to determine the restrictions or other limitations of the 
individual Awards under this Section 5.2, including the authority to reduce 
Awards, to determine payout schedules and the extent of vesting or to pay no 
Awards, in its sole discretion, if the Committee preserves such authority at 
the time of grant by language to this effect in its authorizing resolutions 
or otherwise.  The Committee may provide that in the event a Participant 
terminates employment or service for any one or more reason during a Plan 
Year, the Participant shall forfeit all rights to any Award for the Plan Year.

           (e)  ADJUSTMENTS FOR MATERIAL CHANGES.  Performance goals or other 
features of an Award may provide that they (a) shall be adjusted to reflect a 
change in corporate capitalization, a corporate transaction (such as a 
reorganization, combination, separation, or merger) or a complete or partial 
corporate liquidation, or (b) shall be calculated either without regard for 
or to reflect any change in accounting policies or practices affecting the 
Company and/or the business criteria or performance goals or targets, or (c) 
shall be adjusted for any other circumstance or event, but only to the extent 
in each case that such adjustment or determination in respect of 
Performance-Based Awards would be consistent with the requirements of Section 
162(m) to qualify as performance-based compensation.

           (f)  SECTION 162(m) CONSIDERATIONS.  Options or SARs granted under 
this Plan at an exercise price not less than Fair Market Value at the 
applicable date of grant, and (except to the extent an Award becomes vested 
or payable as a result of a Change in Control Event) other Qualified 
Performance-Based Awards granted under this Section 5.2, shall be interpreted 
in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) to qualify as 
performance-based compensation.

      5.3  STOCK UNITS.

           (a)  GRANTS.  Subject to Section 5.3(d) and such rules and 
procedures as the Committee may establish from time to time, the Committee 
may, in its discretion, authorize Stock Unit Awards and permit an Eligible 
Person to elect to defer or receive in Stock Units all or a portion of the 
compensation the Eligible Person could otherwise elect to defer under any 
other Company plan, or in respect of any Award hereunder, or may grant Awards 
in the form of Stock Units in lieu of or in addition to any other Award under 
this Plan.  The specific terms, conditions and provisions relating to each 
Stock Unit Award or election, including the form of payment to be made at or 
following the vesting thereof, shall be set forth in or pursuant to the 
Participant's Award Agreement in respect thereof.

                                        14
<PAGE>

           (b)  OTHER PROVISIONS.  The Committee shall determine, among other 
terms of a Stock Unit Award, the form of payment of Stock Units, whether in 
cash, Common Stock, or other consideration (including any other Award) or any 
combination thereof, and the applicable vesting and payout provisions of the 
Award.  The Committee in the Award Agreement may permit the Participant to 
elect the form and time of payout of vested Stock Units on such conditions or 
subject to such procedures as the Committee may impose.

           (c)  STOCK UNITS.  Each Award Agreement for an Award of Stock 
Units shall include the applicable benefit distribution and termination 
provisions, which may include elective features, for such Award and shall 
specify the form of payment.

           (d)  LIMIT ON CERTAIN STOCK UNIT AWARDS. Notwithstanding anything 
contained herein to the contrary, any Stock Unit Award or Stock Unit Awards 
which individually or in the aggregate would constitute an "employee pension 
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA")) shall be made only to Eligible Persons who 
are members of "a select group of management or highly compensated employees" 
(as provided in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA) of the 
Company. 

           5.4  DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS.  In its discretion, the Committee 
may grant to any Eligible Person DERs concurrently with the grant of any 
Option, Restricted Stock, Stock Unit or other stock-based Award, on such 
terms as set forth by the Committee in the Award Agreement.  DERs shall be 
based on all or part of the amount of dividends declared on shares of Common 
Stock and shall be credited as of dividend payment dates, during the period 
between the date of grant (or such later date as the Committee may set) and 
the date the stock-based Award is exercised or expires (or such earlier date 
as the Committee may set), as determined by the Committee.  DERs shall be 
payable in cash or shares, or (to the extent permitted by law) may be subject 
to such conditions, not inconsistent with Section 162(m) (in the case of 
Options or SARs, or other Awards intended to satisfy its conditions with 
respect to deductibility), as may be determined by the Committee.

VI.   OTHER PROVISIONS.

      6.1  RIGHTS OF ELIGIBLE PERSONS, PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES.

           (a)  EMPLOYMENT STATUS.  Status as an Eligible Person shall not be 
construed as a commitment that any Award will be made under this Plan to an 
Eligible Person or to Eligible Persons generally.

                                        15
<PAGE>

           (b)  NO EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT.  Nothing contained in this Plan (or 
in any other documents related to this Plan or to any Award) shall confer 
upon any Eligible Person or other Participant any right to continue in the 
employ or other service of the Company or constitute any contract or 
agreement of employment or other service, nor shall interfere in any way with 
the right of the Company to change such person's compensation or other 
benefits or to terminate the employment of such person, with or without 
cause, but nothing contained in this Plan or any document related hereto 
shall adversely affect any independent contractual right of such person 
without his or her consent thereto.

           (c)  PLAN NOT FUNDED.  Awards payable under this Plan shall be 
payable in shares or from the general assets of the Corporation, and (except 
as provided in Section 1.4(b)) no special or separate reserve, fund or 
deposit shall be made to assure payment of such Awards.  No Participant, 
Beneficiary or other person shall have any right, title or interest in any 
fund or in any specific asset (including shares of Common Stock, except as 
expressly otherwise provided) of the Company by reason of any Award 
hereunder.  Neither the provisions of this Plan (or of any related 
documents), nor the creation or adoption of this Plan, nor any action taken 
pursuant to the provisions of this Plan shall create, or be construed to 
create, a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company 
and any Participant, Beneficiary or other person.  To the extent that a 
Participant, Beneficiary or other person acquires a right to receive payment 
pursuant to any Award hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the 
right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.

      6.2  ADJUSTMENTS; EARLY TERMINATION.

           (a)  ADJUSTMENTS.  If the outstanding shares of Common Stock are 
changed into or exchanged for cash, other property or a different number or 
kind of shares or securities of the Corporation, or if additional shares or 
new or different securities are distributed with respect to the outstanding 
shares of Common Stock, through a reorganization or merger in which the 
Corporation is the surviving entity, or through a combination, consolidation, 
recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reverse 
stock split, stock consolidation, dividend or distribution of cash or 
property to the stockholders of the Corporation, or if there shall occur any 
other extraordinary corporate transaction or event in respect of the Common 
Stock or a sale of substantially all the assets of the Corporation as an 
entirety which in the judgment of the Committee materially affects the Common 
Stock, then the Committee shall, in such manner and to such extent (if any) 
as it deems appropriate and equitable, (i) proportionately adjust any or all 
of (1) the number and kind of shares or other consideration that is subject 
to or may be delivered under this Plan and pursuant to outstanding Awards, 
(2) any performance standards appropriate to any

                                        16
<PAGE>

outstanding Awards, and/or (3) the consideration payable with respect to 
Awards granted prior to any such change and the price, if any, paid in 
connection with Restricted Stock Awards; or (ii) in the case of an 
extraordinary dividend or other distribution, merger, reorganization, 
consolidation, combination, sale of assets, split up, exchange or spin off, 
make provision for a cash payment or for the substitution or exchange of (1) 
any or all outstanding Awards or the cash, securities or property deliverable 
to the holder of any or all outstanding Awards, for (2) cash, property and/or 
other securities, based upon the distribution or consideration payable to 
holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation upon or in respect of such 
event; provided, however, in each case, that with respect to awards of 
Incentive Stock Options, no such adjustment shall be made without the consent 
of the holder which would cause this Plan to violate Section 422 or 424(a) of 
the Code or any successor provisions thereto.  Corresponding adjustments 
shall be made with respect to SARs based upon the adjustment made to the 
Options to which they relate.

           (b)  POSSIBLE EARLY TERMINATION OF AWARDS.  If any Award or other 
right to acquire Common Stock has not been exercised or has not become vested 
or exercisable prior to (i) a dissolution of the Corporation or (ii) a 
reorganization event described in Section 6.2(a) that the Corporation does 
not survive and no provision has been made for the substitution, exchange or 
other settlement of such Award, such Award shall thereupon terminate.

           (c)  LIMITATION ON AWARD ADJUSTMENTS.  To the extent required in 
the case of an Award intended as a Performance-Based Award for purposes of 
Section 162(m), the Committee shall have no discretion (i) to increase the 
amount of compensation or the number of shares that would otherwise be due 
upon the attainment of the applicable performance goal or the exercise of the 
option or SAR or (ii) to waive the achievement of any applicable performance 
goal as a condition to receiving a benefit or right under an Award.

      6.3  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT; TERMINATION OF SUBSIDIARY STATUS.

           Any Award to the extent not exercised shall terminate and become 
null and void upon a Termination of Employment of the Participant, except as 
set forth in subsections (a) through (e) below or as otherwise expressly 
provided by the Committee. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 
to the contrary, all Awards shall be subject to earlier termination pursuant 
to or as contemplated by Section 1.6 and Section 6.2 of this Plan.  Unless 
the Committee otherwise provides, any and all rights to an Award, to the 
extent not exercised or vested, shall expire immediately upon a Termination 
of Employment of the

                                        17
<PAGE>

Participant for cause, of which the Committee (in the case of any dispute 
about cause) shall be the sole judge.

           (a)  NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS.  Unless the Committee otherwise 
expressly provides in the Award Agreement:

                (i)    If the Participant's employment by the Company 
      terminates by reason other than death, Disability or cause, or by 
      reason of a Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary, then the Participant 
      shall have three months after the date of Termination of Employment to 
      exercise any Nonqualified Stock Option to the extent that it was 
      exercisable on such date;

                (ii)   If the Participant's employment by the Company 
      terminates by reason of a Disability, or if Participant suffers a 
      Disability within three months of a Termination of Employment under 
      subsection (i) above, then the Participant or Participant's Personal 
      Representative, as the case may be, shall have twelve months after the 
      date of Disability (or, if earlier, Termination of Employment) to 
      exercise any Nonqualified Stock Option to the extent that it was 
      exercisable on such date; and

                (iii)  If the Participant dies while in the employ of the 
      Company, or within three months after a Termination of Employment under 
      subsection (i) or (ii) above, then the Participant's Beneficiary may 
      exercise, at any time within twelve months after the Participant's 
      Termination of Employment, any Nonqualified Stock Option to the extent 
      that it was exercisable on the date of the Participant's Termination of 
      Employment);

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the Option be exercised after the 
expiration of its term or its earlier termination under any other provisions 
of the Plan.

           (b)  INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS.  Unless the Committee otherwise 
expressly provides in the Award Agreement:

                (i)    If the Participant's employment by the Company 
      terminates by reason other than death, Disability or cause, or by 
      reason of a Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary, then the Participant 
      shall have three months after the date of Termination of Employment to 
      exercise any Incentive Stock Option to the extent that it was 
      exercisable on such date;

                (ii)   If the Participant's employment by the Company 
      terminates by reason of a Disability, or if Participant suffers a 
      Disability within three months of a Termination of Employment under 
      subsection (i) above, then the Participant or Participant's Personal 
      Representative, as

                                        18
<PAGE>

      the case may be, shall have twelve months after the date of Disability 
      (or, if earlier, Termination of Employment) to exercise any Incentive 
      Stock Option to the extent that it was exercisable on such date; and

                (iii)  If the Participant dies while in the employ of the 
      Company, or within three months after a Termination of Employment under 
      subsection (i) or (ii) above, then the Participant's Beneficiary may 
      exercise, at any time within twelve months after the Participant's 
      Termination of Employment, any Incentive Stock Option to the extent 
      that it was exercisable on the date of the Participant's Termination of 
      Employment);

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the Option be exercised after the 
expiration of its term or its earlier termination under other provision of 
this Plan.

           (c)  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.  Each SAR shall have the same 
termination provisions and exercisability periods as the Option to which it 
relates.  The exercisability period of a SAR shall not exceed that provided 
in the related Award Agreement, and the SAR shall expire at the end of such 
exercisability period.

           (d)  OTHER AWARDS.  The Committee shall establish in respect of 
each other Award granted hereunder the Participant's rights and benefits (if 
any) in the event of a Termination of Employment and in so doing may make 
distinctions based upon, among other factions, the cause of termination and 
the nature of the Award.

           (e)  EXTENSION OF EXERCISE.  Notwithstanding the foregoing 
provisions but subject to Section 6.2, in the event of, or in anticipation 
of, a Termination of Employment with the Company, the Committee may, in its 
discretion, increase the portion of the Award available to the Participant 
(or Participant's Beneficiary or Personal Representative, as the case may be) 
or extend the exercisability period upon such terms as the Committee shall 
determine.

      6.4  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

           This Plan, the granting and vesting of Awards under this Plan and 
the offer, issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock and/or the payment 
of money under this Plan or under Awards granted hereunder are subject to 
compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations 
(including but not limited to state and federal securities law and federal 
margin requirements) and to such approvals by any listing, agency or any 
regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for 
the Corporation, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith.  Any 
securities delivered

                                        19

under this Plan shall be subject to such restrictions, and the person 
acquiring such securities shall, if requested by the Corporation, provide 
such assurances and representations to the Corporation as the Corporation may 
deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal 
requirements.

      6.5  TAX WITHHOLDING.

           Upon any exercise, vesting, or payment of any Award or upon the 
disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an 
Incentive Stock Option prior to satisfaction of the holding period 
requirements of Section 422 of the Code, the Company shall have the right at 
its option to (i) require the Participant (or the Participant's Personal 
Representative or Beneficiary, as the case may be) to pay or provide for 
payment of the amount of any taxes which the Company may be required to 
withhold with respect to such transaction or (ii) deduct from any amount 
payable the amount of any taxes which the Company may be required to withhold 
with respect to such cash amount.  In any case where a tax is required to be 
withheld in connection with the delivery of shares of Common Stock under this 
Plan, the Committee may permit the Participant to elect, pursuant to such 
rules and subject to such conditions as the Committee may establish, to have 
the Corporation reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise 
reacquire) the appropriate number of shares valued at their then Fair Market 
Value, to satisfy such withholding obligation.

      6.6  PLAN AMENDMENT, TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION.

           (a)  BOARD OR COMMITTEE AUTHORIZATION.  The Board may, at any 
time, terminate or, from time to time, amend, modify or suspend this Plan, in 
whole or in part.  No Awards may be granted during any suspension of this 
Plan or after termination of this Plan, but the Committee shall retain 
jurisdiction as to Awards then outstanding in accordance with the terms of 
this Plan.

           (b)  STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL.  Any amendment to this Plan shall be 
subject to stockholder approval to the extent then required under Sections 
422 and 424 of the Code or any other applicable law, or deemed necessary or 
advisable by the Board.

           (c)  AMENDMENTS TO AWARDS.  Without limiting any other express 
authority of the Committee under but subject to the express limits of this 
Plan (including Section 6.2(c)), the Board or the Committee, by agreement or 
resolution, may waive conditions of or limitations on Awards to Eligible 
Persons that the Committee in the prior exercise of its discretion has 
imposed, without the consent of a Participant, and may make other changes to 
the terms and conditions of Awards that do not affect, in any manner 
materially adverse to the Employee Participant, his or her rights and 
benefits under an Award.

           (d)  LIMITATIONS ON AMENDMENTS TO PLAN AND AWARDS.  No amendment, 
suspension or termination of this Plan or change of or

                                        20
<PAGE>

affecting any outstanding Award shall, without written consent of the 
Participant, affect in any manner materially adverse to the Participant any 
rights or benefits of the Participant or obligations of the Corporation under 
any Award granted under this Plan prior to the effective date of such change. 
 Changes contemplated by Section 6.2 shall not be deemed to constitute 
changes or amendments for purposes of this Section 6.6.

      6.7  PRIVILEGES OF STOCK OWNERSHIP.

           Except as otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee or this 
Plan, a Participant shall not be entitled to any privilege of stock ownership 
as to any shares of Common Stock not actually delivered to and held of record 
by him or her.  No adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights as a 
stockholder for which a record date is prior to such date of delivery.

      6.8  EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS PLAN.

           The effective date of this Plan was March 4, 1994. Amendments 
effective April 8, 1997 were approved by the Board, subject to approval of 
stockholders, and did not adversely affect any award holder's rights or 
benefits under this Plan.

      6.9  TERM OF THIS PLAN.

           No Award shall be granted after March 3, 2004 (the "Termination 
Date").  Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Plan or in an applicable 
Award Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond such date, 
and all authority of the Committee with respect to Awards hereunder, 
including its authority to amend an Award, shall continue during any 
suspension of this Plan and in respect of outstanding Awards on such 
Termination Date.

      6.10 GOVERNING LAW/CONSTRUCTION/SEVERABILITY.

evidencing Awards and all other related documents shall be governed by, and 
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland.

           (b)  SEVERABILITY.  If any non-essential provision shall be held 
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid and unenforceable, the 
remaining provisions of this Plan shall continue in effect.

           (c)  PLAN CONSTRUCTION; BIFURCATION.  Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary in this Plan, the provisions of this Plan may at any time be 
bifurcated by the Board or the Committee in any manner so that certain 
provisions of any Award Agreement (or this Plan) intended (or required in 
order) to satisfy the

                                        21

applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3 or to qualify for exemption from the 
limit on deductibility under Section 162(m) (to the extent permitted thereby)

Awards to those persons intended to satisfy the requirements of the 
applicable rule or rules thereunder.

               (a)  Upon receipt of a written request (a "REGISTRATION REQUEST")

                                       3

<PAGE>

Company shall (i) promptly give notice of the Registration Request to all 
non-requesting Holders and (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, within 
45 days after its receipt of such Registration Request a registration 
statement for the purpose of effecting a Registration of the sale of all 
Registrable Shares by the requesting Holders and any other Holder who 
requests to have his Registrable Shares included in such registration 
statement within 10 days after receipt of notice by such Holder of the 
Registration Request.  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to

after its receipt of such Registration Request (including, without 
limitation, the execution of an undertaking to file post-effective amendments 
and appropriate qualification under applicable state securities and real 
estate syndication laws); and shall keep such Registration continuously

any action to effect any such Registration, qualification or compliance 
pursuant to this Section 2 in any particular jurisdiction in which the 
Company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process 
in effecting such Registration, qualification or compliance unless the 
Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right (the
"SUSPENSION RIGHT") to defer such filing (or suspend sales under any filed
registration statement or defer the updating of any filed registration statement
and suspend sales thereunder) for a period of not more than 105 days during any
one-year period ending on December 31, if the Company shall furnish to the
Holders a certificate signed by an executive officer or any director of the
Company stating that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, it would be
detrimental to the Company and its shareholders to file such registration
statement or amendment thereto at such time (or continue sales under a filed
registration statement) and therefore the Company has elected to defer the
filing of such registration statement (or suspend sales under a filed
registration statement).

               (b)  The Company shall not be required to effect more than two
(2)  Registrations pursuant to this Section 2.

               (a)  On and after the Conversion Date (as defined in the Series A
Preferred Articles Supplementary), so long as the Investor and its Affiliates 
hold at least 50% of the Registrable Shares, if the Company proposes to register
under the Securities Act any of its common equity securities with an expected
aggregate offering price to the public of at least $100 million (other than
pursuant to (i) a registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act, (ii) a registration on Form S-4 or any successor form, or (iii)
an offering of securities in connection with an employee benefit, share
dividend, share ownership or dividend 

                                       4

reinvestment plan) and the registration form to be used may be used for the 
registration of Registrable Shares, the Company will give prompt written 
notice to all Holders of Registrable Shares of its intention to effect such a 
registration (each a "PIGGYBACK NOTICE") and, subject to subparagraph 3(c) 
below, the Company will include in such registration all Registrable Shares 
with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion 
therein within ten days after the date of sending the Piggyback Notice (a 
"PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION"), unless, if the Piggyback Registration is not an 
underwritten offering, the Company in its reasonable judgement determines 
that, or in the case of an underwritten Piggyback Registration, the managing 
underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion, the 
inclusion of Registrable Shares would adversely interfere with such offering, 
affect the Company's securities in the public markets, or otherwise adversely 
affect the Company.  Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Company to 
withdraw any such registration in its sole discretion.

               (b)  If a Piggyback Registration is a primary registration on
behalf of the Company and, if the Piggyback Registration is not an underwritten
offering, the Company in its reasonable judgement determines that, or in the
case of an underwritten Piggyback Registration, the managing underwriters advise
the Company in writing that in their opinion, the number of securities requested
to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an
orderly manner within a price range acceptable to the Company, the Company will
include in such registration (i) first, the securities the Company proposes to
sell and (ii) second, the Registrable Shares requested to be included in such
Registration and any other securities requested to be included in such
registration, pro rata among the holders of Registrable Shares requesting such
registration and the holders of such other securities on the basis of the number
of Shares requested for inclusion in such registration by each such holder.

               (c)  If a Piggyback Registration is a secondary registration on
behalf of holders of the Company's securities other than the holders of
Registrable Shares, and, if the Piggyback Registration is not an underwritten
offering, the Company determines that, or in the case of an underwritten
Piggyback Registration, the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing
that in their opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such
registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such
offering within a price range acceptable to the holders initially requesting
such registration, the Company will include in such registration the securities
requested to be included therein by the holders requesting such registration and
the Registrable Shares requested to be included in such registration, pro rata
among the holders of securities requesting such registration on the basis of the
number of Shares initially requested for inclusion in such registration by each
such holder.

               (d)  In the case of an underwritten Piggyback Registration, the
Company will have the right to select the investment banker(s) and manager(s) to
administer the offering.  In a registration pursuant to Section 2(a), the
Holders requesting registration shall have the right to select the investment
banker(s) and manager(s) to administer the offering, which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company.  If requested by the underwriters for any
underwritten offerings by Holders, under a registration requested pursuant to
Section 2(a), the Company will enter into a customary underwriting agreement
with such underwriters for such 

                                  5

<PAGE>

offering, to contain such representations and warranties by the Company and 
such other terms as are customarily contained in agreements of that type.  
The Holders who elect to register Registrable Shares shall be a party to such 
underwriting agreement and may, at their option, require that any or all of 
the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such 
underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of Holders. 
 Such Holders shall not be required to make any representations or warranties 
to or agreement with the Company or the underwriters other than 
representations, warranties or agreements regarding the Holders and the 
Holders' intended method of distribution and any other representation or 
warranties required by law.

          Section 4.     REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.

               (a)  The Company shall promptly notify the Holders of the
occurrence of the following events:

                    (i)   when any registration statement relating to the
     Registrable Shares or post-effective amendment thereto filed with the
     Commission has become effective;

                    (ii)  the issuance by the Commission of any stop order
     suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement relating to the
     Registrable Shares;

                    (iii) the suspension of an effective registration
     statement by the Company in accordance with the last paragraph of
     Section 2(a) hereof;

                    (iv)  the Company's receipt of any notification of the
     suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Shares covered by a
     registration statement for sale in any jurisdiction; and

                    (v)   the existence of any event, fact or circumstance that
     results in a registration statement or prospectus relating to Registrable
     Shares or any document incorporated therein by reference containing an
     untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact
     required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
     not misleading during the distribution of securities.

          The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of any such registration
statement or any state qualification as promptly as possible.  The Investor
agrees by acquisition of the Registrable Shares that upon receipt of any notice
from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the type described in Section
4(a)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) to immediately discontinue its disposition of
Registrable Shares pursuant to any registration statement relating to such
securities until the Investor's receipt of written notice from the Company that
such disposition may be made.

                                      6

               (b)  The Company shall provide to the Holders, at no cost to the
Holders, a copy of the registration statement and any amendment thereto used to
effect the Registration of the Registrable Shares, each prospectus contained in
such registration statement or post-effective amendment and any amendment or
supplement thereto and such other documents as the requesting Holders may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Shares covered by such registration statement.  The Company consents to the use
of each such prospectus and any supplement thereto by the Holders in connection
with the offering and sale of the Registrable Shares covered by such
registration statement or any amendment thereto.  The Company shall also file a
sufficient number of copies of the prospectus and any post-effective amendment
or supplement thereto with the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (or, if the Common
Shares are no longer listed thereon, with such other securities exchange or
market on which the Common Shares are then listed) so as to enable the Holders
to have the benefits of the prospectus delivery provisions of Rule 153 under the
Securities Act.

               (c)  The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Registrable Shares covered by a registration statement to be
registered with or approved by such state securities authorities as may be
necessary to enable the Holders to consummate the disposition of such shares
pursuant to the plan of distribution set forth in the registration statement;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to take any action to
effect any such Registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this
Section 4 in any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required
to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such
Registration, qualification or compliance unless the Company is already subject
to service in such jurisdiction..

               (d)  Subject to the Company's Suspension Right, if any event,
fact or circumstance requiring an amendment to a registration statement relating
to the Registrable Shares or supplement to a prospectus relating to the
Registrable Shares shall exist, immediately upon becoming aware thereof the
Company agrees to notify the Holders and prepare and furnish to the Holders a
post-effective amendment to the registration statement or supplement to the
prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other
required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
Registrable Shares, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

               (e)  The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
(including the payment of any listing fees) to obtain the listing of all
Registrable Shares covered by the registration statement on each securities
exchange on which securities of the same class or series are then listed.

               (f)  The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
comply with the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in connection with the offer
and sale of Registrable Shares pursuant to a registration statement, and, as
soon as reasonably practicable following the end of any fiscal year during which
a registration statement effecting a Registration of the 

                                       7

<PAGE>

Registrable Shares shall have been effective, to make available to its 
security holders an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 
11(a) of the Securities Act.

               (g)  The Company agrees to cooperate with the selling Holders to
facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing
Registrable Shares to be sold pursuant to a Registration and not bearing any
Securities Act legend; and enable certificates for such Registrable Shares to be
issued for such numbers of shares and registered in such names as the Holders
may reasonably request at least two business days prior to any sale of
Registrable Shares.

          Section 5.     EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION.  The Company shall pay all
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the registration,
qualification or compliance pursuant to Sections 2, 3 and 4 hereof.  All Selling
Expenses incurred in connection with the sale of Registrable Shares by any of
the Holders shall be borne by the Holder selling such Registrable Shares.  Each
Holder shall pay the expenses of its own counsel.

          Section 6.     INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.

               (a)  The Company will (i) indemnify each Holder, each Holder's
officers and directors, and each person controlling such Holder within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against all expenses, claims,
losses, damages and liabilities (including reasonable legal expenses), arising
out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a
material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus relating to
the Registrable Shares, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or based on any
omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
(ii) reimburse each Holder for all reasonable legal or other expenses incurred
in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such
expenses are incurred, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company will not be liable in
any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or
expense arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder or underwriter
for inclusion therein; and PROVIDED FURTHER, that in the case of a
nonunderwritten offering, the Company shall not be liable in any such case with
respect to any preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement to
the extent that any such expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities
result from the fact that Registrable Shares were sold to a person as to whom it
shall be established that there was not sent or given at or prior to the written
confirmation of such sale a copy of the prospectus as then amended or
supplemented under circumstances were such delivery is required under the
Securities Act, if the Company shall have previously furnished copies thereof to
such Indemnified Person in sufficient quantities to enable such Indemnified
Party to satisfy such obligations and the expense, claim, loss, damage or
liability of such Indemnified Person results from an untrue statement or
omission of a material fact contained it the preliminary prospectus or the
preliminary prospectus supplement which was corrected in the prospectus.

                                      8

<PAGE>

               (b)  Each Holder selling shares pursuant to a Registration (and,
in the case of a nonunderwritten offering, any agents of each Holder that
facilitate the distribution of Registrable Shares) will (i) indemnify the
Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the
registration statement, each underwriter, if any, of the Company's securities
covered by such registration statement, and each person who controls the Company
or such underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act,
against all expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of or based on any untrue
statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such
registration statement or prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or
based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue
statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is
made in such registration statement or prospectus, in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder
for inclusion therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company for all reasonable legal
or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending any
such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.

               (c)  Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 6
(the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") promptly after such Indemnified Party
has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, but the
omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have to the Indemnified Party pursuant to the provisions
of this Section 6 except to the extent of the actual damages suffered by such
delay in notification.  The Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such
action, including the employment of counsel to be chosen by the Indemnifying
Party to be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and payment of
expenses.  The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ its own counsel
in any such case, but the legal fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at
the expense of the Indemnified Party, unless the employment of such counsel
shall have been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection
with the defense of such action, or the Indemnifying Party shall not have
employed counsel to take charge of the defense of such action or the Indemnified
Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it
or them which are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the Indemnified Party),
in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party.  No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation,
shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.

               (d)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is
unavailable to a party that would have been an Indemnified Party under this
Section 6 in respect of any expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities
referred to herein, then each party that would 

                                       9

<PAGE>

have been an Indemnifying Party hereunder shall, in lieu of indemnifying such 
Indemnified Party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such 
Indemnified Party as a result of such expenses, claims, losses, damages and 
liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative 
fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and such Indemnified Party on 
the other in connection with the statement or omission which resulted in such 
expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities, as well as any other 
relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault shall be determined by 
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue 
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a 
material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or 
such Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to 
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. 
 The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if 
contribution pursuant to this Section were determined by pro rata allocation 
or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the 
equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 6(d).

               (e)  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

               (f)  In no event shall any Holder be liable for any expenses,
claims, losses, damages or liabilities pursuant to this Section 6 in excess of
the net proceeds to such Holder of any Registrable Shares sold by such Holder.

          Section 7.     INFORMATION TO BE FURNISHED BY HOLDERS.  Each Holder
shall furnish to the Company such information as the Company may reasonably
request and as shall be required in connection with the Registration and related
proceedings referred to in Section 2 or Section 3 hereof.  If any Holder fails
to provide the Company with such information within 10 days of receipt of the
Company's request, the Company's obligations under Section 2 or Section 3
hereof, as applicable, with respect to such Holder or the Registrable Shares
owned by such Holder, shall be suspended until such Holder provides such
information.

          Section 8.     UNDERTAKING TO PARTICIPATE IN UNDERWRITING.  If the
Holders of at least $75 million of the Registrable Shares shall propose to sell
Registrable Shares in an underwritten public offering, the Company shall make
available, for reasonable periods of time and with reasonable notice,  members
of the management of the Company and its affiliates for reasonable assistance in
selling efforts relating to such offering, to the extent customary for a public
offering (including, without limitation, to the extent customary, senior
management attendance at due diligence meetings with the underwriters and their
counsel and road shows) and shall enter into underwriting agreements containing
usual and customary terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Company
for such types of offerings.

          Section 9.     RULE 144 SALES.

                                       10

<PAGE>

               (a)  The Company covenants that it will use its best efforts to
file the reports required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act, so
as to enable any Holder to sell Registrable Shares pursuant to Rule 144 under
the Securities Act.

               (b)  In connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition
by any Holder of any Registrable Shares pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, the Company shall cooperate with such Holder to facilitate the
timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Shares
to be sold and not bearing any Securities Act legend, and enable certificates
for such Registrable Shares to be for such number of shares and registered in
such names as the selling Holder may reasonably request at least two business
days prior to any sale of Registrable Shares.

          Section 10.    TRANSFER OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  The rights and
obligations of a Holder under this Agreement may be transferred or otherwise
assigned to a transferee or assignee of Registrable Shares provided that (i)
such transferee or assignee becomes a party to this Agreement or agrees in
writing to be subject to the terms hereof to the same extent as if such
transferee or assignee were an original party hereunder and (ii) the Company is
given written notice by such Holder of such transfer or assignment stating the
name and address of such transferee or assignee and identifying the securities
with regard to which such rights and obligations are being transferred or
assigned.

          Section 11.    MISCELLANEOUS.

               (a)  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects by the laws of the State of Maryland.

               (b)  ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement constitutes the full and
entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to the
subject matter hereof.

               (c)  AMENDMENT.  No supplement, modification, waiver or
termination of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
Company and the Holders of at least two-thirds of the Registrable Shares.

               (d)  NOTICES, ETC.  Each notice, demand, request, request for
approval, consent, approval, disapproval, designation or other communication
(each of the foregoing being referred to herein as a notice) required or desired
to be given or made under this Agreement shall be in writing (except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement), and shall be effective and deemed to have
been received (i) when delivered in person, (ii) when sent by fax with receipt
acknowledged, (iii) five (5) days after having been mailed by certified or
registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or
(iv) the next business day after having been sent by a nationally recognized
overnight mail or courier service, receipt requested.  Notices shall be
addressed as follows: (a) if to the Investor, at the Investor's address or fax
number set forth below its signature hereon, or at such other address or fax
number as the Investor shall have furnished to the Company in writing, or (b) if
to any assignee or transferee of 

                                       11

<PAGE>

an Investor, at such address or fax number as such assignee or transferee 
shall have furnished the Company in writing, or (c) if to the Company, at the 
address of its principal executive offices and addressed to the attention of 
the President, or at such other address or fax number as the Company shall 
have furnished to the Investors or any assignee or transferee.  Any notice or 
other communication required to be given hereunder to a Holder in connection 
with a registration may instead be given to the designated representative of 
such Holder.

               (e)  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which may be executed by fewer than all of the parties
hereto (PROVIDED that each party executes one or more counterparts), each of
which shall be enforceable against the parties actually executing such
counterparts, and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.

               (f)  SEVERABILITY.  In the event that any provision of this
Agreement becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, unenforceable or void, this Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect without said provision.

               (g)  SECTION TITLES.  Section titles are for descriptive purposes
only and shall not control or alter the meaning of this Agreement as set forth
in the text.

               (h)  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  This Agreement shall be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

               (i)  REMEDIES.  The Company and the Investor acknowledge that
there would be no adequate remedy at law if any party fails to perform any of
its obligations hereunder, and accordingly agree that the Company and each
Holder, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in
equity, shall be entitled to compel specific performance of the obligations of
another party under this Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any State thereof having
jurisdiction.

               (j)  ATTORNEYS' FEES.  If the Company or any Holder brings an
action to enforce its rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party in the
action shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with such action,
including any appeal of such action.

                      EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS

     2.1  EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  This Agreement shall become

having received written consent from the Company.

                                    ARTICLE III

                            INCIDENTAL REGISTRATION RIGHTS

     3.1  NOTICE AND REGISTRATION.  If the Company proposes to register any
shares of Common Stock or other securities issued by it having terms
substantially similar to Eligible Securities ("Other Securities") for public
sale under the Securities Act (whether proposed to be offered for sale by the
Company or by any other Person) on a form and in a manner which would permit
registration of Eligible Securities for sale to the public under the Securities
Act, it will give prompt written notice to each Investor of its intention to do
so, and upon the written request of any of the Investors delivered to the
Company within fifteen (15) Business Days after the giving of any such notice
(which request shall specify the number of Eligible Securities intended to be
disposed of by such Investor and the intended method of disposition thereof) the
Company will use all reasonable efforts to effect, in connection with the
registration of the Other Securities, the registration under the Securities Act
of all Eligible Securities which the Company has been so requested to register
by the Investor or Investors, to the extent required to permit the disposition
(in accordance with the intended method or methods thereof as aforesaid) of
Eligible Securities so to be registered provided that:

             (a) if, at any time after giving such written notice of its 
     intention to register any Other Securities and prior to the effective date
     of the registration statement filed in connection with such registration, 
     the Company shall determine for any reason not to register the Other 
     Securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such 
     determination to the Investor or Investors seeking

                                       3
<PAGE>

     registration hereunder (hereafter referred to as the "SELLING
     INVESTORS") and thereupon the Company shall be relieved of its
     obligation to register such Eligible Securities in connection with the
     registration of such Other Securities (but not from its obligation to pay
     Registration Expenses to the extent incurred in connection therewith as 
     provided in Section 3.2);

          (b) The Company will not be required to effect any registration 
     pursuant to this Article 3 if the Company shall have been advised in 
     writing (with a copy to Investor) by a nationally recognized independent 
     investment banking firm selected by the Company to act as lead underwriter
     in connection with the public offering of securities by the Company, that 
     in such firm's opinion, a registration of the Eligible Securities which the
     Company has been requested to register by Investor at that time would 
     materially and adversely affect the Company's own scheduled offering; and

          (c) The Company shall not be required to effect any registration of
     Eligible Securities under this Article 3 incidental to the registration of
     any of its securities in connection with mergers, acquisitions, exchange 
     offers, subscription offers, dividend reinvestment plans or stock options 
     or other employee benefit plans.

     3.2 REGISTRATION EXPENSES. The Company (as between the Company and the
Selling Investors) shall be responsible for the payment of all Registration
Expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to this Article 3.

                                     ARTICLE IV

                               REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

          4. 1 REGISTRATION AND QUALIFICATION.  If and whenever the Company is
required to use all reasonable efforts to effect the registration of any 
Eligible Securities under the Securities Act as provided in Article 3, the 
Company will as promptly as is practicable:

          (a) prepare, file and use all reasonable efforts to cause to
     become effective a registration statement under the Securities Act 
     regarding the Eligible Securities to be offered;

          (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to
     such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith
     as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective and to 
     comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the 
     disposition of all Eligible Securities until the earlier of

                                       4
<PAGE>

     such time as all of such Eligible Securities have been disposed of in 
     accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the Selling 
     Investors set forth in such registration statement or the expiration of 
     twelve (12) months after such registration statement becomes effective;

          (c) furnish to each Selling Investor and to any underwriter of such 
     Eligible Securities such number of conformed copies of such registration 
     statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in each 
     case including all exhibits), such number of copies of the prospectus 
     included in such registration statement (including each preliminary 
     prospectus and any summary prospectus), in conformity with the 
     requirements of the Securities Act, such documents incorporated by 
     reference in such registration statement or prospectus, and such other 
     documents as such Selling Investor or such underwriter may reasonably 
     request;

          (d) use all reasonable efforts to register or qualify all Eligible 
     Securities covered by such registration statement under such other 
     securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling 
     Investors or any underwriter of such Eligible Securities shall 
     reasonably request, and do any and all other acts and things which may 
     be reasonably requested by the Selling Investors or any underwriter to 
     consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Eligible 
     Securities covered by such registration statement, except the Company 
     shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to do 
     business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it is not 
     so qualified, or to subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where 
     it is not then subject to taxation, or to consent to general service of 
     process in any jurisdiction where it is not then subject to service of 
     process;

          (e) use all reasonable efforts to list the Eligible Securities on 
     each national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then 
     listed, if the listing of such securities is then permitted under the 
     rules of such exchange; and

          (f) immediately notify the Selling Investors at any time when a 
     prospectus relating to a registration pursuant to Article 3 hereof is 
     required to be delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of 
     any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such 
     registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement 
     of material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be 
     stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light 
     of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and at 
     the request of any Selling Investor prepare and furnish to such Investor 
     as many copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as 
     the Selling Investor may request so that, as thereafter delivered to the 
     purchasers of

                                       5
<PAGE>

     such Eligible Securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue 
     statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required 
     to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in 
     light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

The Company may require the Investors to furnish the Company such information
regarding the Investors and the distribution of such securities as the Company
may from time to time reasonably request in writing and as shall be required by
law or by the SEC in connection with any registration.

          4.2  UNDERWRITING. (a) In the event that any registration 
     pursuant to Article 3 hereof shall involve, in whole or in part, an 
     underwritten offering, the Company may require Eligible Securities 
     requested to be registered pursuant to Article 3 to be included in such 
     underwriting on the same terms and conditions as shall be applicable to 
     the Other Securities being sold through underwriters under such 
     registration.

          (b) If requested by the underwriters for any underwritten offering 
     of Eligible Securities pursuant to a registration requested hereunder, 
     the Company will enter into and perform its obligations under an 
     underwriting agreement with such underwriters for such offering, such 
     agreement to contain such representations and warranties by the Company 
     and such other terms and provisions as are customarily contained in 
     underwriting agreements with respect to secondary distributions, 
     including, without limitation, indemnities and contribution to the 
     effect and to the extent provided in Article 6 hereof. Each Selling 
     Investor shall be a party to any such underwriting agreement and the 
     representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part 
     of, the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also 
     be made to and for the benefit of each such Selling Investor. Such 
     agreement shall also contain such representations and warranties by each 
     such Selling Investor and such other terms and provisions as are 
     customarily contained in underwriting agreements with respect to 
     secondary distributions, including, without limitation, indemnities and 
     contribution to the effect and to the extent provided in Article 6.

          4.3  QUALIFICATION FOR RULE 144 SALES. The Company will take 
     all actions reasonably necessary to comply with the filing requirements 
     described in Rule 144(c)(1) so as to enable the Investors to sell 
     Eligible Securities without registration under the Securities Act and, 
     upon the written request of any Investor, the Company will deliver to 
     such Investor a written statement as to whether it has complied with 
     such filing requirements.

                                  ARTICLE V

                    PREPARATION; REASONABLE INVESTIGATION

     5.1 PREPARATION; REASONABLE INVESTIGATION. In connection with the 
preparation and filing of each registration statement registering Eligible 
Securities under the Securities Act, the Company will give each Selling 
Investor and the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel and 
accountants, drafts of such registration statement for their review and 
comment prior to filing and such reasonable and customary access to its books 
and records and such opportunities to discuss the business of the Company 
with its officers and the independent public accountants who have certified 
its financial statements as shall be necessary, in the opinion of the Selling 
Investors and such underwriters or their respective counsel, to conduct a 
reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act.

                                 ARTICLE VI

                     INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

     6.1 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. (a) In the event of any 
registration of Eligible Securities hereunder, the Company will enter into 
customary indemnification arrangements to indemnify and hold harmless each 
Selling Investor, and each Person who participates as an underwriter in the 
offering or sale of such securities, and each Person, if any, who controls 
such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act against any 
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several, to 
which such Person may be subject under the Securities Act or otherwise 
insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions 
or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any 
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained 
in any registration statement under which such securities were registered 
under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus 
included therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document 
incorporated by reference therein, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission 
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary 
to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company will promptly 
reimburse each such Person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably 
incurred by such Person in connection with investigating or defending any 
such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; PROVIDED that the 
Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such 
loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) 
or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged 
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration 
statement, any such preliminary

                                       7
<PAGE>

prospectus or final prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and 
in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such 
Selling Investor expressly for use in the registration statement. Such 
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any 
investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Investor or any such 
Person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Selling 
Investor. The Company also shall agree to provide provision for contribution 
as shall be reasonably requested by the Selling Investors or any underwriters 
in circumstances where such indemnity is held unenforceable.

     (b) Each Selling Investor, by virtue of exercising its registration 
rights hereunder, agrees and undertakes to enter into customary 
indemnification arrangements to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same 
manner and to the same extent as set forth in clause (a) of this Article 6) 
the Company, each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who 
shall sign such registration statement, each Person who participates as an 
underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each Person, if 
any, who controls the Company or any such underwriter within the meaning of 
the Securities Act, with respect to any statement in or omission from such 
registration statement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus 
included therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, but only to the 
extent that such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in 
conformity with written information furnished by such Investor to the Company 
expressly for use in the registration statement. Such indemnity shall remain 
in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf 
of the Company or any such director, officer or controlling Person and shall 
survive the transfer of the registered securities by the Investor and the 
expiration of this Agreement. Each Investor also shall agree to provide 
provision for contribution as shall be reasonably requested by the Company or 
any underwriters in circumstances where such indemnity is held unenforceable.

     (c) Indemnification and contribution similar to that specified in the 
preceding subdivisions of this Article 6 (with appropriate modifications)

                              ARTICLE II

              EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS 

     2.1. EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. This Agreement shall become 
effective immediately; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the exercise by Investor of 
any registration rights granted pursuant to Article 3 hereof prior to the 
last day of the eighteenth (18th) month following the Closing Date shall be 
subject to Investor first having received written consent from the Company.

                          ARTICLE III

                INCIDENTAL REGISTRATION RIGHTS

     3.1. NOTICE AND REGISTRATION. If the Company proposes to register any 
shares of Common Stock or other securities issued by it having terms 
substantially similar to Eligible Securities ("Other Securities") for public 
sale under the Securities Act to be offered for sale by, and for the benefit 
of, the Company on a form and in a manner which would permit registration of 
Eligible Securities for sale to the public under the Securities Act, it will  
give prompt written notice to Investor (whether or not the direct holder of 
Eligible Securities) of its intention to do so, and upon the written request 
of Investor (the "Investor Notice") delivered to the Company within fifteen 
(15) Business Days after the giving of any such notice (which request shall 
specify the number of Eligible Securities intended to be disposed of by 
Investor and the intended method of disposition thereof) the Company will use 
all reasonable efforts to effect, in connection with the registration of the 
Other Securities, the registration under the Securities Act of all Eligible 
Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by Investor, 
to the extent required to permit the disposition (in accordance with the 
intended method or methods thereof as aforesaid) of Eligible securities so to 
be registered, provided that:

      (a) if, at any time after giving such written notice of its 
   intention to register any Other Securities and prior to the of 
   effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with 
   such registration, the Company shall determine for any reason not to 
   register the Other Securities, the Company may, at its election, give 
   written notice of such determination to Investor and thereupon the 
   Company shall be relieved of its obligation to register such Eligible 
   Securities in connection with the registration of such Other Securities 
   (but not from its obligation to pay Registration Expenses to the extent 
   incurred in connection therewith as provided in Section 3.2);

      (b) The Company will not be required to effect any registration 
    pursuant to this Article 3 if the Company shall

                                       4

<PAGE>

   have been advised in writing (with a copy to Investor) by a nationally 
   recognized independent investment banking firm selected by the Company 
   to act as lead underwriter in connection with the public offering of 
   securities by the Company, that in such firm's opinion, a registration 
   of the number of Eligible Securities which the Company has been 
   requested to register by Investor and any existing or future holder of 
   incidental registration rights (collectively, the "Selling 
   Shareholders") at that time would adversely affect the Company's own 
   scheduled offering or the market price of the Common Stock (a "Full 
   Cutback"), provided, however, that if registration of some but not all 
   of the shares requested to be registered by Investor and any other Selling 
   Shareholder would not adversely affect the Company's offering or the 
   market price of the Common Stock, the aggregate number of shares of all 
   of the Selling Shareholders that may be included in such registration 
   shall be allocated first, to the Selling Shareholders who presently 
   have demand registration rights with the Company and their permitted 
   transferees in accordance with their respective registration rights 
   agreements and second, if applicable, to the other Selling Shareholders 
   pro rata according to the total number of shares for which registration 
   was initially requested by such Selling Shareholders (a "Pro Rata Cutback");

         (c) The Company shall not be required to effect any registration of
   Eligible Securities under this Article 3 incidental to the registration 
   of any of its securities in connection with mergers, acquisitions, 
   exchange offers, subscription offers, dividend reinvestment plans or 
   stock options or other employee benefit plans; and
   
         (d) Investor shall have the right to request registration of 
   Eligible Securities pursuant to this Article 3 no more than a total of 
   two times during the life of this Agreement.  No registration request 
   by Investor shall be deemed a request for purposes of this Section 3.1(d) 
   unless all of the Eligible Securities requested to be registered 
   by Investor as specified in an Investor Notice are so registered by the 
   Company in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

     3.2. REGISTRATION EXPENSES. The Company (as between the Company and 
Investor) shall be responsible for the payment of all Registration Expenses 
in connection with any registration pursuant to this Article 3.

   3.3. NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.

     (a) At the time of the delivery of the Investor Notice, Investor must 
directly hold the number of Eligible Securities that Investor is requesting 
to be registered or follow the procedures specified herein. If at the time of 
the delivery of the Investor

                                      5
<PAGE>

Notice Investor does not directly hold the number of Eligible Securities that 
Investor is requesting to be registered, an exercise notice (the "Exercise 
Notice") must also be delivered in accordance with the partnership agreement 
of the Partnership requesting the redemption of OP Units (which together with 
any other Eligible Securities directly held by Investor) equal the number of 
Eligible Securities Investor is requesting the Company register pursuant to 
Article 3. If upon delivery of the Exercise Notice, all or any portion of the 
OP units are redeemed for cash or Unrestricted Common Stock (as defined 
below), the Investor Notice will be deemed to be amended to reflect the 
change in the number of shares of restricted Common Stock received upon such 
redemption.

     (b) Notwithstanding any provision of the Partnership Agreement to the 
contrary, this Exercise Notice may only be revoked by Investor if (i) the 
registration statement filed in connection with such registration of Eligible 
Securities does not become effective, or (ii) the Eligible Securities that 
the Investor is requesting to be registered are not included in such 
registration statement in accordance with the provisions hereof, or (iii) a 
Full Cutback has occurred, or (iv) a Pro Rata Cutback has occurred; provided, 
however, that, in such event, the Exercise Notice may be revoked only with 
respect to the number of Eligible Securities not included in such 
registration statement. Within five (5) Business Days of receipt of written 
notice of any of the events described above, Investor must provide written 
notice to the Company of the intent of Investor to withdraw the Exercise 
Notice or Investor will be deemed to have declined the right to revoke the 
Exercise Notice.

     1.4. ISSUANCE OF UNRESTRICTED COMMON STOCK. If upon any redemption of OP 
Units the Company issues to Investor Common Stock where its issuance was 
registered under the Securities Act ("Unrestricted Common Stock"), such 
shares of Unrestricted Common Stock shall not be deemed Eligible Securities 
for purposes of this Agreement and Investor will have no registration rights, 
and the Company will be relieved of all of its obligations hereunder, with 
respect to those shares of Unrestricted Common Stock.

                            ARTICLE IV

                      REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

     4.1. REGISTRATION AND QUALIFICATION.  If and whenever the Company is 
required to use all reasonable efforts to effect the registration of any 
Eligible Securities under the Securities Act as provided in Article 3, the 
Company will as promptly as is practicable:

          (a) prepare, file and use all reasonable efforts to cause to become
   effective a registration statement under the Securities Act regarding 
   the Eligible Securities to be offered;

                                      6

<PAGE>

         (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements 
   to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection 
   therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement 
   effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with 
   respect to the disposition of all Eligible Securities until the earlier 
   of such time as all of such Eligible Securities have been disposed of in 
   accordance with the intended methods of disposition by Investor set 
   forth in such registration statement or the expiration of twelve (12) 
   months after such registration statement becomes effective;
   
         (c) furnish to Investor and to any underwriter of such Eligible 
   Securities such number of conformed copies of such registration 
   statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in each 
   case including all exhibits), such number of copies of the prospectus 
   included in such registration statement (including each preliminary 
   prospectus and any summary prospectus), in conformity with the 
   requirements of the Securities Act, such documents incorporated by 
   reference in such registration statement or prospectus, and such other 
   documents as Investor or such underwriter may reasonably request;
   
         (d) use all reasonable efforts to register or qualify all Eligible 
   Securities covered by such registration statement under such other 
   securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as Investor or any 
   underwriter of such Eligible Securities shall reasonably request, and do 
   any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably requested by 
   Investor or any underwriter to consummate the disposition in such 
   jurisdictions of the Eligible Securities covered by such registration 
   statement, except the Company shall not for any such purpose be 
   required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation 
   in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so qualified, or to subject itself 
   to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not then subject to taxation, 
   or to consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it 
   is not then subject to service of process;
   
         (e) use all reasonable efforts to list the Eligible Securities on 
   each national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then 
   listed, if the listing of such securities is then permitted under the 
   rules of such exchange; and
   
         (f) immediately notify Investor at any time when a prospectus 
   relating to a registration pursuant to Article 3 hereof is required to 
   be delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event as a 
   result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, 
   as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of material fact or 
   omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or 
   necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
   
                                    7 
<PAGE>

   circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and at the 
   request of Investor prepare and furnish to such Investor as many copies 
   of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as Investor may 
   reasonably request so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of 
   such Eligible Securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue 
   statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required 
   to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in 
   light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
   
The Company may require Investor to furnish the Company such information
regarding Investor and the distribution of such Eligible Securities as the
Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing and as shall be
required by law or by the SEC in connection with any registration. The Company
may also impose such restrictions and limitations on the distribution of such
Eligible Securities as the Company reasonably believes are necessary or
advisable to comply with applicable law or to effect an orderly distribution,
including those restrictions set forth in Section 4.3 hereof.

     4.2. UNDERWRITING. (a) In the event that any registration pursuant 
     to Article 3 hereof shall involve, in whole or in part, an underwritten
     offering, the Company may require Eligible Securities requested to be 
     registered pursuant to Article 3 to be included in such underwriting on 
     the same terms and conditions as shall be applicable to the Other 
     Securities being sold through underwriters under such registration. In 
     such case, the holders of Eligible Securities on whose behalf Eligible 
     Securities are to be distributed by such underwriters shall be parties 
     to any such underwriting agreement. Such agreement shall contain such 
     representations and warranties by Investor and such other terms and 
     provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements with 
     respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation, 
     indemnities and contribution to the effect and to the extent provided in 
     Article 6. The representations and warranties in such underwriting 
     agreement by, and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to 
     and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for 
     the benefit of such holders of Eligible Securities.

     (b)  If requested by the underwriters for any underwritten offering 
     of Eligible Securities pursuant to a registration requested hereunder, 
     the Company will enter into and perform its obligations under an 
     underwriting agreement with such underwriters for such offering, such 
     agreement to contain such representations and warranties by the Company 
     and such other terms and provisions as are customarily contained in 
     underwriting agreements with respect to secondary distributions, 
     including, without limitation, indemnities and
     
                                       8
<PAGE>

     contribution to the effect and to the extent provided in Article 6 
     hereof. Investor shall be a party to any such underwriting agreement and 
     the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the 
     part of, the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall 
     also be made to and for the benefit of Investor. Such agreement shall 
     also contain such representations and warranties by Investor and such 
     other terms and provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting 
     agreements with respect to secondary distributions, including, without 
     limitation, indemnities and contribution to the effect and to the extent 
     provided in Article 6.

     4.3. BLACKOUT PERIODS. At any time when a registration statement effected
pursuant to Article 3 relating to Eligible Securities is effective, upon written
notice from the Company to Investor that the Company has determined in good
faith, with the advice of counsel, that Investor's sale of Eligible Securities
pursuant to the registration statement would require disclosure of non-public
material information the disclosure of which would have a material adverse
effect on the Company or would otherwise adversely effect a material financing,
acquisition, disposition, merger or other comparable transaction, Investor
shall suspend sales of Eligible Securities pursuant to such registration
statement until the earlier of:

        (X) the date upon which such material information is disclosed to 
     the public or ceases to be material, or

        (Y) such time as the Company notifies Investor that sales pursuant 
     to such registration statement may be resumed.

     4.4. QUALIFICATION FOR RULE 144 SALES. The Company will take all actions
reasonably necessary to comply with the filing requirements described in Rule
144(c)(1) so as to enable Investor to sell Eligible Securities without
registration under the Securities Act and, upon the written request of Investor,
the Company will deliver to Investor a written statement as to whether it has

registration of Eligible Securities hereunder, the Company will enter into 
customary indemnification arrangements to indemnify and hold harmless 
Investor, and each Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering 
or sale of such securities, and each Person, if any, who controls such 
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act against any losses, 
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several, to which such 
Person may be subject under the Securities Act or otherwise insofar as such 
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or proceedings 
in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement 
or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any 
registration statement under which such securities were registered under the 
Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus included 
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated 
by reference therein, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state 
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make 
the statements therein not misleading, and the Company will promptly 
reimburse each such Person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably 
incurred by such Person in connection with investigating or defending any 
such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; PROVIDED that the 
Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such 
loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) 
or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged 
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration 
statement, any such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, amendment or 
supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information 
furnished to the Company by Investor expressly for use in the registration 
statement. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of 
any investigation made by or on behalf of Investor or any such Person and 
shall survive the transfer of such securities by Investor. The Company also 
shall agree to provide provision for contribution as shall be reasonably 
requested by Investor or any underwriters in circumstances where such 
indemnity is held unenforceable.

     (b) Investor, by virtue of exercising its registration rights hereunder, 
agrees and undertakes to enter into customary indemnification arrangements to 
indemnify and hold harmless (in the

                                       10

same manner and to the same extent as set forth in clause (a) of this 
Article 6) the Company, each director of the Company, each officer of the 
Company who shall sign such registration statement, each Person who participates
as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each Person, 
if any, who controls the Company or any such underwriter within the meaning 
of the Securities Act, with respect to any statement in or omission from such 
registration statement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus 
included therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, but only to the 
extent that such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in 
conformity with written information furnished by Investor to the Company 
expressly for use in the registration statement. Such indemnity shall remain 
in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf 
of the Company or any such director, officer or controlling Person and shall 
survive the transfer of the registered securities by Investor and the 
expiration of this Agreement. Investor also shall agree to provide provision 
for contribution as shall be reasonably requested by the Company or any 
underwriters in circumstances where such indemnity is held unenforceable.

     (c) Indemnification and contribution similar to that specified in the 
preceding subdivisions of this Article 6 (with appropriate modifications) 
shall be given by the Company and Investor with respect to any required 
registration or other qualification of Eligible Securities under any federal 
or state law or regulation of governmental authority other than the 
Securities Act.

                        ------------------------------------

          2.1.  EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. This Agreement shall

                                   ARTICLE III

                           INCIDENTAL REGISTRATION RIGHTS
                           ------------------------------

          3.1.  NOTICE AND REGISTRATION. If the Company proposes to register 
any shares of Common Stock or other securities issued by it having terms 
substantially similar to Eligible Securities ("Other Securities") for public 
sale under the Securities Act to be offered for sale by, and for the benefit 
of, the Company on a form and in a manner which would permit registration of 
Eligible Securities for sale to the public under the Securities Act or as 
specified in Section 3.1(d) below, it will give prompt written notice to 
Investor (whether or not the direct holder of Eligible Securities) of its 
intention to do so, and upon the written request of Investor (the "Investor 
Notice") delivered to the Company within fifteen (15) Business Days after the 
giving of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of 
Eligible Securities intended to be disposed of by Investor and the intended 
method of disposition thereof) the Company will use all reasonable efforts to 
effect, in connection with the registration of the Other Securities, the 
registration under the Securities Act of all Eligible Securities which the 
Company has been so requested to register by Investor, to the extent required 
to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended method or methods 
thereof as aforesaid) of Eligible Securities so to be registered, provided 
that:

            (a)  if, at any time after giving such written notice of its 
      intention to register any Other Securities and prior to the effective 
      date of the registration statement filed in connection with such 
      registration, the Company shall determine for any reason not to 
      register the Other Securities, the Company may, at its election, give 
      written notice of such determination to Investor and thereupon the 
      Company shall be relieved of its obligation to register such
      

                                     Q-2-3


<PAGE>


Eligible Securities in connection with the registration of such Other 
Securities (but not from its obligation to pay Registration Expenses to the 
extent incurred in connection therewith as provided in Section 3.2);

      (b)  The Company will not be required to effect any registration 
pursuant to this Article 3 if the Company shall have been advised in writing 
(with a copy to Investor) by a nationally recognized independent investment 
banking firm selected by the Company to act as lead underwriter in 
connection with the public offering of securities by the Company, that in 
such firm's opinion, a registration of the number of Eligible Securities 
which the Company has been requested to register by Investor and any existing 
or future holder of incidental registration rights (collectively, the 
"Selling Shareholders") at that time would adversely affect the Company's own 
scheduled offering or the market price of the Common Stock (a "Full 
Cutback"), provided, however, that if registration of some but not all of the 
shares requested to be registered by Investor and any other Selling 
Shareholder would not adversely affect the Company's offering or the market 
price of the Common Stock, the aggregate number of shares of all of the 
Selling Shareholders that may be included in such registration shall be 
allocated first, to the Selling Shareholders who presently have demand 
registration rights with the Company and their permitted transferees in 
accordance with their respective registration rights agreements and second, 
if applicable, to the other Selling Shareholders pro rata according to the 
total number of shares for which registration was initially requested by such 
Selling Shareholders (a "Pro Rata Cutback");

      (c) The Company shall not be required to effect any registration of 
Eligible Securities under this Article 3 incidental to the registration of 
any of its securities in connection with mergers, acquisitions, exchange 
offers, subscription offers, dividend reinvestment plans or stock options or 
other employee benefit plans;

      (d) If the Company proposes to register any Other Securities to be 
offered for sale by, and for the benefit of the Company, utilizing an 
unallocated shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and the SEC does not 
permit any secondary offering by an Investor to be registered in connection 
therewith, the Company agrees to use all reasonable efforts to effect the 
registration under the Securities Act of all Eligible Securities which the 
Company has been so requested to register by Investor, to the extent such 
secondary offering may be registered utilizing a registration statement on 
Form S-3 and to the extent required to permit the disposition of Eligible 
Securities so to be registered. Any registration to be effected pursuant

                                     Q-2-4





<PAGE>

     to this Section 3.1(d) shall be subject to the limitations and 
     restrictions set forth in this Agreement; and

           (e) Investor shall have the right to request registration of 
     Eligible Securities pursuant to this Article 3 no more than a total of 
     two times during the life of this Agreement. No registration request by 
     an Investor shall be deemed a request for purposes of this Section 
     3.1(e) unless all of the Eligible Securities requested to be registered 
     by an Investor as specified in an Investor Notice are so registered by 
     the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
     
          3.2. REGISTRATION EXPENSES.  The Company (as between the Company 
and Investor) shall be responsible for the payment of all Registration 
Expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to this Article 3.

          3.3. NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.

          (a)  At the time of the delivery of the Investor Notice, Investor 
     must directly hold the number of Eligible Securities that Investor is 
     requesting to be registered or follow the procedures specified herein. 
     If at the time of the delivery of the Investor Notice Investor does not 
     directly hold the number of Eligible Securities that Investor is 
     requesting to be registered, an exercise notice (the "Exercise Notice") 
     must also be delivered in accordance with the partnership agreement of 
     the Partnership requesting the redemption of OP Units (which together 
     with any other Eligible Securities directly held by Investor) equal the 
     number of Eligible Securities Investor is requesting the Company 
     register pursuant to Article 3. If upon delivery of the Exercise 
     Notice, all or any portion of the OP Units are redeemed for cash or 
     Unrestricted Common Stock (as defined below), the Investor Notice will 
     be deemed to be amended to reflect the change in the number of shares 
     of restricted Common Stock received upon such redemption.

           (b) Notwithstanding any provision of the Partnership Agreement to 
     the contrary, this Exercise Notice may only be revoked by Investor if 
     (i) the registration statement filed in connection with such 
     registration of Eligible Securities does not become effective, or 
     (ii) the Eligible Securities that the Investor is requesting to be 
     registered are not included in such registration statement in 
     accordance with the provisions hereof, or (iii) a Full Cutback has 
     occurred, or (iv) a Pro Rata Cutback has occurred; provided, however, 
     that, in such event, the Exercise Notice may be revoked only with 
     respect to the number of Eligible Securities not included in such 
     registration statement. Within five (5) Business Days of receipt of 
     written notice of any of the events described above, Investor must 
     provide written notice
     
                                     Q-2-5


<PAGE>

     to the Company of the intent of Investor to withdraw the Exercise 
     Notice or Investor will be deemed to have declined the right to revoke 
     the Exercise Notice.
     
          3.4. ISSUANCE OF UNRESTRICTED COMMON STOCK.  If upon any redemption 
of Op Units the Company issues to Investor Common Stock where its issuance 
was registered under the Securities Act ("Unrestricted Common Stock"), such 
shares of Unrestricted Common Stock shall not be deemed Eligible Securities 
for purposes of this Agreement and Investor will have no registration rights, 
and the Company will be relieved of all of its obligations hereunder, with 
respect to those shares of Unrestricted Common Stock.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                             REGISTRATION PROCEDURES
                             -----------------------

          4.1. REGISTRATION AND QUALIFICATION.  If and whenever the Company 
is required to use all reasonable efforts to effect the registration of any 
Eligible Securities under the Securities Act as provided in Article 3, the 
Company will as promptly as is practicable:

           (a) prepare, file and use all reasonable efforts to cause to 
     become effective a registration statement under the Securities Act 
     regarding the Eligible Securities to be offered;
     
           (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements 
     to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection 
     therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement 
     effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with 
     respect to the disposition of all Eligible Securities until the earlier 
     of such time as all of such Eligible Securities have been disposed of 
     in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by Investor set 
     forth in such registration statement or the expiration of twelve (12) 
     months after such registration statement become effective;
     
           (c) furnish to Investor and to any underwriter of such Eligible 
     Securities such number of conformed copies of such registration 
     statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in each 
     case including all exhibits), such number of copies of the prospectus 
     included in such registration statement (including each preliminary 
     prospectus and any summary prospectus), in conformity with the 
     requirements of the Securities Act, such documents incorporated by 
     reference in such registration statement or prospectus, and such other 
     documents as Investor or such underwriter may reasonably request;
     
                                     Q-2-6


<PAGE>

          (d) use all reasonable efforts to register or qualify all Eligible 
     Securities covered by such registration statement under such other 
     securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as Investor or any
     underwriter of such Eligible Securities shall reasonably request, and do
     any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably requested by
     Investor or any underwriter to consummate the disposition in such 
     jurisdictions of the Eligible Securities covered by such registration
     statement, except the Company shall not for any such purpose be required
     to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any 
     jurisdiction wherein it is not so qualified, or to subject itself to
     taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not then subject to taxation,
     or to consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction where
     it is not then subject to service of process;

          (e) use all reasonable efforts to list the Eligible Securities on 
     each national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then 
     listed, if the listing of such securities is then permitted under the
     rules of such exchange; and

          (f) immediately notify Investor at any time when a prospectus 
     relating to a registration pursuant to Article 3 hereof is required
     to be delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any 
     event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration
     statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of material
     fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein
     or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
     circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and at the
     request of Investor prepare and furnish to such Investor as many copies
     of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as Investor may
     reasonably request so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers 
     of such Eligible Securities, such prospectus shall not include an 
     untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact 
     required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements 
     therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading.

The Company may require Investor to furnish the Company such information 
regarding Investor and the distribution of such Eligible Securities as the 
Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing and as shall be 
required by law or by the SEC in connection with any registration. The 
Company may also impose such restrictions and limitations on the distribution 
of such Eligible Securities as the Company reasonably believes are necessary 
or advisable to comply with applicable law or to effect an orderly 
distribution, including those restrictions set forth in Section 4.3 hereof.

          4.2.  UNDERWRITING.

          (a) In the event that any registration pursuant to Article 3 hereof
     shall involve, in whole or in part, an underwritten offering, the
     Company may require Eligible Securities requested to be registered 
     pursuant to Article 3 to be included in such underwriting on
     the same terms and conditions as shall be applicable to the Other 
     Securities being sold through underwriters under such registration. In
     such case, the holders of Eligible Securities on whose behalf Eligible
     Securities are to be distributed by such underwriters shall be parties
     to any such underwriting agreement. Such agreement shall contain such 
     representations and warranties by Investor and such other terms and
     provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements 
     with respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation, 
     indemnities and contribution to the effect and to the extent provided 
     in Article 6. The representations and warranties in such underwriting 
     agreement by, and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to 
     and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for 
     the benefit of such holders of Eligible Securities.

          (b) If requested by the underwriters for any underwritten offering 
     of Eligible Securities pursuant to a registration requested hereunder, 
     the Company will enter into and perform its obligations under an 
     underwriting agreement with such underwriters for such offering, such 
     agreement to contain such representations and warranties by the Company
     and such other terms and provisions as are customarily contained in 
     underwriting agreements with respect to secondary distributions,
     including, without limitation, indemnities and contribution to the effect
     and to the extent provided in Article 6 hereof. Investor shall be a party
     to any such underwriting agreement and the representations and 
     warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of, the Company to 
     and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to and for 
     the benefit of Investor. Such agreement shall also contain such 
     representations and warranties by Investor and such other terms and
     provisions as are customarily contained in underwriting agreements
     with respect to secondary distributions, including, without limitation,
     indemnities and contribution to the effect and to the extent provided in
     Article 6.

          4.3.  BLACKOUT PERIODS.  At any time when a registration statement 
effected pursuant to Article 3 relating to Eligible Securities is effective, 
upon written notice from the Company to Investor that the Company has 
determined in good faith, with the advice of counsel, that Investor's sale of 
Eligible Securities pursuant to the registration statement would require 
disclosure

                                     Q-2-8
<PAGE>

of non-public material information the disclosure of which would have a 
material adverse effect on the Company or would otherwise adversely effect a 
material financing, acquisition, disposition, merger or other comparable 
transaction, Investor shall suspend sales of Eligible Securities pursuant to 
such registration statement until the earlier of:

               (X)  the date upon which such material information is 
           disclosed to the public or ceases to be material, or

               (Y)  such time as the Company notifies Investor that sales 
           pursuant to such registration statement may be resumed.

           4.4  QUALIFICATION FOR RULE 144 SALES.  The Company will take all 
actions reasonably necessary to comply with the filing requirements described 
in Rule 144(c) so as to enable Investor to sell Eligible Securities without 
registration under the Securities Act and, upon the written request of 
Investor, the Company will deliver to Investor a written statement as to 
whether it has complied with such filing requirements.

                                       
                                   ARTICLE V

                    PREPARATION; REASONABLE INVESTIGATION

           5.1  Preparation; Reasonable Investigation.  In connection with 
the preparation and filing of each registration statement registering 
Eligible Securities under the Securities Act, the Company will give Investor 
and the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel and accountants, 
drafts of such registration statement for their review and comment prior to 
filing and such reasonable and customary access to its books and records and 
such opportunities to discuss the business of the Company with its officers 
and the independent public accountants who have certified its financial 
statements as shall be necessary, in the opinion of Investor and such 
underwriters or their respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable 
investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act.

                                       
                                   ARTICLE VI

                       INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

           6.1  Indemnification and Contribution.
      
           (a)  In the event of any registration of Eligible Securities 
hereunder, the Company will enter into customary indemnification 
arrangements to indemnify and hold harmless Investor, and each Person who 
participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities, 
and each Person,

                                       
                                     Q-2-9

if any, who controls such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities 
Act against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or 
several, to which such Person may be subject under the Securities Act or 
otherwise insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses 
(or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon 
(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact 
contained in any registration statement under which such securities were 
registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus or final 
prospectus included therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any 
document incorporated by reference therein, or (ii) any omission or alleged 
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or 
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Company will 
promptly reimburse each such Person for any legal or any other expenses 
reasonably incurred by such Person in connection with investigating or 
defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; 
PROVIDED that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent 
that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in 
respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue 
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in 
such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus or final 
prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with 
written information furnished to the Company by Investor expressly for use in 
the registration statement.  Such indemnity shall remain in full force and 
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Investor or 
any such Person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by 
Investor.  The Company also shall agree to provide provision for contribution 
as shall be reasonably requested by Investor or any underwriters in 
circumstances where such indemnity is held unenforceable.

      (b)  Investor, by virtue of exercising its registration rights 
hereunder, agrees and undertakes to enter into customary indemnification 
arrangements to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the 
same extent as set forth in clause (a) of this Article 6) the Company, each 
director of the Company, each officer of the Company who shall sign such 
registration statement, each Person who participates as an underwriter in the 
offering or sale of such securities and each Person, if any, who controls 
the Company or any such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, 
with respect to any statement in or omission from such registration 
statement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus included therein, or 
any amendment or supplement thereto, but only to the extent that such 
statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with 
written information furnished by Investor to

                                       
                                     Q-2-10

     the Company expressly for use in the registration statement. Such 
     indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any 
     investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any such director, 
     officer or controlling Person and shall survive the transfer of the 
     registered securities by Investor and the expiration of this Agreement. 
     Investor also shall be reasonably requested by the Company or any 
     underwriters in circumstances where such indemnity is held unenforceable.

          (c) Indemnification and contribution similar to that specified in 
     the preceding subdivisions of this Article 6 (with appropriate 
     modifications) shall be given by the Company and Investor with respect 
     to any required registration or other qualification of Eligible 
     Securities under any federal or state law or regulation of governmental 
     authority other than the Securities Act.

                                 PROMISSORY NOTE
                             DUE NOVEMBER 16, 2007

$1,000,000.00                                                Dallas,Texas
_____________                                                November 17, 1997

          FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Edward C. Coppola, Jr., an individual 
("MAKER"), unconditionally promises to pay to The Macerich Company, a 
Maryland corporation (together with any successor or assignee by operation of 
law or otherwise, the "PAYEE"), on the earlier of November 16, 2007 or such 
other date as provided herein, in the manner and at the place hereinafter 
provided, the lesser of (i) one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) and (ii) the 
unpaid principal amount of all advances made by Payee to Maker for the 
purposes of Maker's purchase of common stock of the Payee pursuant to the 
terms of The Macerich Company Amended and Restated 1994 Incentive Plan (the 
"Plan").  All advances made under this Note shall be noted hereon; PROVIDED, 
HOWEVER, that the failure to make a notation shall not limit or otherwise 
affect the obligations of Maker hereunder with respect to payments of 
principal or interest on this Note.

          Maker also promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance 
of this Note from the date such principal is advanced until such principal is 
paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of: (i) the maximum 
amount allowable pursuant to applicable law; or (ii) 7.00%.  Interest that is 
due and payable but not yet paid shall be added to principal and accrue 
interest from the date due.  Interest on this Note shall be computed on the 
basis of a 365-day year, based on the actual number of days elapsed and shall 
be payable in arrears quarterly on the fifteenth (15th) day of each March, 
June, September and December, commencing on December 15, 1997, upon any 
prepayment of this Note (to the extent accrued on the amount being prepaid) 
and at maturity.

          1.   PAYMENTS; VOLUNTARY REPAYMENT.  All payments of principal and 
interest in respect of this Note shall be made in lawful money of the United 
States of America.  Each payment made hereunder shall be credited first to 
interest then due and the remainder of such payment shall be credited to 
principal, and interest shall thereupon cease to accrue upon the principal so 
credited.  Maker shall have the right at any time and from time to time to 
prepay the principal of this Note in whole or in part, without premium or 
penalty, such prepayment hereunder being accompanied by interest on the 
principal amount of the Note being prepaid to the date of prepayment.  
Notwithstanding any payment or prepayment of principal hereunder by Maker, 
Maker acknowledges and agrees that the aggregate advances made by Payee 
hereunder shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.

                                       1
<PAGE>

          2.   MANDATORY REPAYMENT.  

          (a)  If the Board of Directors of Payee (the "Board") makes any 
dividend or other distribution to its stockholders which it determines for 
these purposes to be unusual or extraordinary (an "Extraordinary 
Distribution"), then the Board, or the Compensation Committee of the Board, 
may, in its sole discretion, require that Maker use the Net Cash Proceeds (as 
defined below) of the Extraordinary Distribution to repay this Note.  The Net 
Cash Proceeds shall be applied first to accrued and unpaid interest on this 
Note and second to the unpaid principal balance of this Note.  As used 
herein, Net Cash Proceeds means all cash or cash proceeds from an 
Extraordinary Distribution in respect of the Pledged Collateral (as defined 
in that certain Pledge Agreement (the "Pledge Agreement") dated as of 
November 17, 1997 between Maker and Payee) MINUS the amount of applicable 
federal, state and local taxes which the Board, or the Compensation Committee 
of the Board, reasonably determines will be payable by Maker in connection 
with the Extraordinary Distribution.  The Board, or the Compensation 
Committee of the Board, shall cause Payee to notify Maker in writing at least 
10 days prior to the payment date of any Extraordinary Distribution with 
respect to which it intends to require Maker to use the Net Cash Proceeds to 
repay this Note.  If Maker is required to use the Net Cash Proceeds to repay 
this Note, then within three (3) business days of receipt of the Net Cash 
Proceeds, Maker shall pay to Payee an amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds 
to be so applied.

          (b)  In the event that Maker sells, transfers, assigns or otherwise 
disposes of any of the Pledged Collateral as permitted by and in accordance 
with Section 6 of the Pledge Agreement, Maker shall concurrently repay the 
unpaid principal balance of this Note in an amount equal to the greater of: 
(i)(A) the percentage of the total Pledged Collateral (prior to such 
disposition) that the shares so disposed of represents MULTIPLIED BY (B) the 
unpaid principal amount of this Note or (ii) the amount by which the unpaid 
principal amount of this Note exceeds the Fair Market Value (as defined in 
the Pledge Agreement) of the Pledged Collateral (after giving effect to the 
release of collateral set forth in Section 6 of the Pledge Agreement).

          (c)  If there shall occur a Termination of Employment (as such term 
is defined in the Plan) of Maker, the unpaid principal amount of this Note 
together with accrued interest thereon shall become due and payable on the 
10th business day after the Termination of Employment of Maker except as 
otherwise provided in Section 1.8(d) of the Plan.

          3.   FULL RECOURSE NOTE.  This Note is the Note referred to in the 
Pledge Agreement.  This Note is a full

                                       2

recourse Note and Maker shall be liable for the full payment of principal of 
and interest on this Note.  This Note is also secured by, and is entitled to 
the benefit of, the Pledge Agreement, the terms and provisions of which are 
hereby incorporated herein as if set forth herein in full.

          4.   EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  Each of the following shall constitute an 
Event of Default:

          (a)  The sale, transfer, assignment or other disposition of any 
Pledged Collateral, other than in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
Section 2(b) of this Note and Section 6(c) of the Pledge Agreement;

          (b)  The failure by Maker to pay any principal under this Note when 
due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise, or failure to 
pay any interest or other amount due under this Note within five (5) days 
after the date due; 

          (c)  any challenge, or institution of any proceedings to challenge 
by Maker of the validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Note or 
any endorsement of this Note;

          (d)  any default by Maker of any other obligation under this Note 
or the Pledge Agreement; or

any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

$550,000.00                                             DATED AS OF MAY 2, 1997

     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, David J. Contis ("BORROWER"), an 
employee of Lender, hereby unconditionally promises to pay on demand made in 
accordance with Paragraph 3 below, to the order of Macerich Management 
Company ("LENDER"), in lawful money of the United States and in immediately 
available funds, the full amount of the unpaid principal balance of the 
Demand Loan made by Lender to the undersigned pursuant to Schedule A attached 
hereto. Such payment shall be made for the account of Lender at its office 
located at 233 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 700, Santa Monica, California 90401, 
or at such other office as Lender may notify Borrower. Borrower acknowledges 
and agrees to the following additional terms:

     1.  One-fifth (1/5) of the original amount of this loan will be 
         forgiven by Lender at the end of each successive twelve (12) 
         month period of Borrower's continued employment with Lender 
         elapsing after the date of this Demand Note. In the event 
         Borrower's employment with Lender terminates for any reason 
         before the principal amount of this loan is forgiven or 
         otherwise paid in full, an additional one-sixtieth (1/60) of 
         the original amount of this loan will be forgiven for each full 
         calendar month of Borrower's continued employment with Lender 
         completed since the then most recent anniversary date of the 
         date of this Demand Note.

     2.  Taxable income will be imputed to Borrower as a result of 
         (a) the forgiveness of each portion of this loan as specified 
         in Paragraph 1 above and (b) the lack of interest payments on 
         the principal balance due, so that Lender will issue W-2 forms 
         or 1099 forms, as Lender deems appropriate, to Borrower which 
         reflect such imputed income and, further, that Lender may be 
         required to withhold tax on such income from salary and other 
         compensation payments made to Borrower during and after the 
         period this loan is outstanding. In the event Lender notifies 
         Borrower that funds available to Lender for withholding are 
         insufficient, Borrower agrees to remit to Lender on demand an 
         appropriate amount to cover any and all taxes to be withheld by 
         Lender as contemplated by the previous sentence hereof.

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

     3.  If Borrower's employment with Lender terminates for any reason 
         before the principal amount of this loan is forgiven or 
         otherwise paid in full, all amounts then remaining unpaid on 
         this Demand Note shall be due and payable upon demand and 
         interest shall accrue on such unpaid balance from the date of 
         such termination forward at the rate of ten percent (10%) per 
         annum.

     4.  Lender has not made any representations concerning Lender's 
         willingness not to exercise, or delay exercising, its rights to 
         enforce this Note or to demand payment of this Note. Such 
         demand may be made at any time following the date Borrower's 
         employment with Lender terminates as set forth in Paragraph 3 
         above. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance of this loan 
         from the time of demand forward at the rate of ten percent 
         (10%) per annum. No delay or omission on the part of the Lender 
         in exercising any right or remedy to enforce this Note shall 
         operate as a waiver of such right or remedy under this Note. No 
         waiver by Lender of any right or remedy shall be effective 
         unless in writing and signed by the Lender on the reverse side 
         of the original of this Note and no such waiver on one occasion 
         shall be construed as a waiver on any other occasion. No 
         modification of this Note shall be effective unless the 
         modification is in writing and is signed by the Lender on the 
         reverse side of the original of this Note.

     5.  Borrower agrees that the rights granted to the Lender pursuant 
         to this Note shall accrue to any endorsee of this Note who is 
         lawfully in possession of this Note.

     THIS DEMAND NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA (WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS 
CHOICE OF LAW RULES).

     IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM, BORROWER 
HEREBY EXPRESSLY, INTENTIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THE PARTY 
MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS MADE 
BY LENDER AGAINST BORROWER OR BORROWER AGAINST LENDER.

     BORROWER AGREES TO PAY ALL REASONABLE COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LENDER IN 
ENFORCING AND COLLECTING THIS DEMAND NOTE, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S 
FEES, INCURRED IN LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY SUCH 
ATTORNEY'S FEES INCURRED IN BANKRUPTCY, REORGANIZATION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS.

                              FORMATION AND ORGANIZATION

          1.1  FORMATION.  SDG, Macerich, SSPE and MSPE hereby form a limited 
partnership (the "PARTNERSHIP") under the Act upon the terms and conditions 
set forth in this Agreement.  Each of SSPE and MSPE (and their permitted 
successors-in-interest that are admitted as partners in the Partnership) is a 
general partner in the Partnership and is referred to herein individually as 
a "GENERAL PARTNER," and each of Macerich and SDG (and their permitted 
successors-in-interest that are admitted as partners in the Partnership) is a 
limited partner in the Partnership and is referred to herein individually as 
a "LIMITED PARTNER."  Each of the General Partners and the Limited Partners 
are referred to herein individually as a "PARTNER" and, collectively, as the 
"PARTNERS."  SSPE and SDG, on the one hand, and MSPE and Macerich, on the 
other hand, are jointly referred to herein as a "PARTY" and collectively as 
"PARTIES".  Any contributions by or distributions to a Party shall be deemed 
to have been made to or by, as the case may be, the entities constituting 
such Party in proportion to each such entity's Partnership Interest.  The 
General Partners shall promptly execute, publish or file all assumed or 
fictitious name, or other similar, certificates required by law to be 
published or filed, in connection with the formation and operation of the 
Partnership in each state and locality where it is necessary or desirable to 
publish or file such certificates in order to form and operate the 
Partnership.

          1.2  NAME.  The name of the Partnership shall be "SM Portfolio

lease, sell, maintain, improve, alter, remodel, expand, manage, exchange,

any and all other businesses for which limited partnerships may be formed 
under Delaware law, and (e) to accomplish any of the foregoing purposes for

HOWEVER, that such business shall be limited to and conducted in such a 
manner as to permit any Persons owning any interests in any of the Partners 
at all times to be classified as a "real estate investment trust" within the 
meaning of Section 856 of the Code (a "REIT").  

          1.4  PRINCIPAL OFFICE.  The principal office of the Partnership 
shall be at 233 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 700, Santa Monica, California 
90401, or at such other place as the Executive Committee may, from time to 
time, determine (the "PRINCIPAL OFFICE").

          1.5  TERM.  The Partnership shall commence on the date of this 
Agreement and shall continue until the Partnership is dissolved and 
terminated in accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE 10.

          1.6  TITLE TO PROPERTY.  All real and personal property owned by 
the Partnership shall be owned by the Partnership as an entity and no Partner 
shall have any ownership interest in such property in its individual name or 
right, and each Partner's interest in the Partnership shall be personal 
property for all purposes.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, 
the Partnership shall hold all of its real and personal property in the name 
of the Partnership and not in the name of any Partner.

          1.7  PAYMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL OBLIGATIONS.  The Partnership's credit 
and assets shall be used solely for the benefit of the Partnership, and no 
asset of the Partnership shall be transferred or encumbered for, or in 
payment of, any individual obligation of a Partner.

          1.8  OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS.

               (a)  Each Partner shall be required to devote only such time 
to the affairs of the Partnership as may be necessary for the proper 
performance of such Partner's duties hereunder.  Except to the extent 
expressly provided to the contrary in this SECTION 1.8, nothing in this 
Agreement shall:  (i) limit the rights of each Partner and its Affiliates, 
and such Partner's and Affiliate's respective officers, directors, employees 
and stockholders ("RELATED PERSONS") to serve other Persons in any capacity, 
to own interests in other businesses and undertakings, to pursue and engage 
in other investments, opportunities and activities, and to derive and enjoy 
profits, compensation and other consideration in respect thereof, whether or 
not such services, interests, businesses, undertakings, investments, 
opportunities and activities (collectively, "OTHER INTERESTS") are similar to 
or competitive with the business or assets of the Partnership, (ii) afford 
any Partner any right to share in the profits, compensation and other 
consideration derived from the Other Interests of any other Partner or any 
other Partner's Related Persons, or to participate in the Other Interests of 
any other Partner or any other Partner's Related Persons, (iii) require any 
Partner to disclose to any other Partner or the Partnership the existence or 
nature of any such 

                                      2

<PAGE>

Other Interest, or (iv) obligate any Partner to first offer any such Other 
Interest to any other Partner or the Partnership, or allow any other Partner 
or the Partnership to participate therein.

               (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, until an individual 
Property has been sold or otherwise transferred by the Underlying Partnership 
or Partnership, respectively, a Party (or any Affiliate of a Party) (each a 
"PROPOSING PARTY") shall not obtain an equity interest (whether direct or 
indirect) in any real estate venture ("REAL ESTATE ACTIVITY") within the area 
described as the "Non-Competition Area" for each Property on SCHEDULE 5 
attached hereto, as such SCHEDULE 5 may be amended from time to time, 
("NON-COMPETITION AREA") unless it has first provided the other Party (the 
"NONPROPOSING PARTY") with written notice describing in reasonable detail the 
proposed transaction and offering the transaction as a Partnership 
opportunity (the "PROPOSAL") and the Nonproposing Party has failed to notify 
the Proposing Party within thirty (30) days of its receipt of such notice 
that such Nonproposing Party desires that the Partnership, rather than the 
Proposing Party individually, enter into and invest in such Real Estate 
Activity.  In the event that the Nonproposing Party delivers the notice 
described in the immediately preceding sentence directing that the 
Partnership invest in the Real Estate Activity, each Party shall make any 
Additional Capital Contributions required by the Executive Committee to fund 
the investment of the Partnership pursuant to the Proposal, the Real Estate 
Activity will be an opportunity for the Partnership and the Real Estate 
Activity shall be included as a business of the Partnership within SECTION 
1.3.  The Proposal described above shall include all information that the 
Proposing Party has with respect to the Real Estate Activity, including 
proformas, plans and specifications and economic projections relating to the 
Real Estate Activity. If the Nonproposing Party consents to the Proposing 
Party's investment in the Real Estate Activity individually or fails to 
respond to the Proposal within thirty (30) days after its receipt thereof, 
the Proposing Party or its Affiliate shall be permitted to invest in the Real 
Estate Activity in its individual capacity.

          1.9  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.  To the extent permitted by 
applicable law and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including 
SECTION 5.11 hereof), the Operating Committee and any property manager, when 
acting through the Partnership, are hereby authorized to purchase property 
and services from, sell property and services to, or otherwise deal with any 
Partner, acting on its own behalf, or any Affiliate of any Partner, provided 
that any such purchase, sale, or other transaction (and any such Affiliates' 
affiliation to a Partner) shall be fully disclosed to the Partners and shall 
be made on market terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the 
Partnership (including as to price, quality and payment terms) than if the 
sale, purchase, or other transaction had been entered into with an 
independent third party.

letters of credit to satisfy the "Deposit" requirement under the Purchase

               (b)  Each Party hereby agrees to contribute to the capital of 
the Partnership, as a Capital Contribution, an amount equal to fifty percent 
(50%) of the Closing Funding Requirement (as defined below), subject, 
however, to the remaining provisions of this SECTION 2.2.  As used herein, 
the term "CLOSING FUNDING REQUIREMENT" shall mean the sum of (i) all amounts 
required to be deposited by the Underlying Partnership with Escrow Agent 
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement in order to close the transaction 
thereunder, including amounts due to Equitable under the Purchase Agreement 
as the purchase price consideration paid for the Underlying Properties and 
the Underlying Partnership's share of all closing costs and expenses required 
to be deposited with and paid through Escrow Agent pursuant to the Purchase 
Agreement (the "ESCROW CLOSING REQUIREMENT"), (ii) all out-of-pocket costs 
and expenses paid or payable to Persons other than the Underlying 
Partnership, any Partner or any Affiliate thereof (other than those amounts 
described in CLAUSE (i) above) that have been and/or will be incurred by the 
Underlying Partnership, the Partnership, the Partners and the Partners' 
respective Affiliates in connection with the formation of the Partnership and 
the Underlying Partnership and investigating and acquiring the Properties 
(including, without limitation, costs incurred in connection with the 
negotiation of the Purchase Agreement and this Agreement and all 
out-of-pocket due diligence costs and fees (collectively, "DUE DILIGENCE, 
FORMATION AND ACQUISITION COSTS"), and (iii) the amount set forth in the 
Original Approved Pre-Closing Budget (as defined below) for the funding of 
the Underlying Partnership's initial capital improvement and operating 
reserve (as such amount may be adjusted by the mutual consent of the Partners 
in their sole and absolute discretion) (the "INITIAL RESERVE REQUIREMENTS").

               (c)  Attached hereto as SCHEDULE 1 is a budget (the "ORIGINAL 
APPROVED PRE-CLOSING BUDGET") reflecting the Partners' best and good-faith 
estimate of all Due Diligence, Formation and Acquisition Costs that will be 
incurred in connection with the Partnership and Underlying Partnership's 
formation and the acquisition of the Properties.  In the event that any Party 
incurs Due Diligence, Formation and Acquisition Costs in excess of that 
budgeted in the Original Approved Pre-Closing Budget, the written approval of 
the other Party shall be required before such additional amount may be 
included in the Closing Funding Requirement.  In the event that a Party 
requests in writing that the other Party approve any such additional 
expenditure or cost and the other Party fails to disapprove of the same in 
writing (together with its specific written objections thereto) within five 
(5) business days after its receipt of such request, such expenditure or cost 
shall be deemed approved (but in each case only if such written request 
specifically advises the Party that failure to respond within such five (5) 
business day period will result in such deemed approval).

               (d)  Each of the Parties separately agrees to deposit its 
portion of the Escrow Closing Requirement in escrow in good funds with Escrow 
Agent at least one (1) business day prior to the Underlying Partnership's 
acquisition of the Underlying Properties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
each Party shall be permitted to deposit its portion of the Escrow Closing 
Requirement into a separate escrow established with such Escrow Agent, which 
escrow shall be solely for such Party's benefit until the closing of the 
acquisition of the Underlying Properties, and shall be terminable solely by 
such Party (provided that any such termination shall not relieve or release 
such Party of its obligations hereunder, if any).  Concurrently with such 
Party's deposit of its portion of the Escrow Closing Requirement in escrow, 
such Party shall enter 

                                      5

<PAGE>

into escrow instructions with Escrow Agent authorizing Escrow Agent to 
transfer such amounts into the escrow established for the purchase and sale 
of the Underlying Properties upon the satisfaction of all conditions 
precedent for the closing of such purchase and sale.  Such escrow 
instructions shall also provide that if the closing of the purchase and sale 
of the Underlying Properties does not occur on or before the date set forth 
in SECTION 10.1(h), the escrow shall terminate and all sums held therein 
(together with any interest actually earned thereon) shall be immediately 
returned to such Party (whereupon such Party shall have no further liability 
or duty hereunder with respect to the making of such portion of the Escrow 
Closing Requirement), unless Escrow Agent receives written instructions from 
such Party to extend such escrow.  Any interest earned on amounts placed in 
escrow prior to such closing shall accrue for the benefit of the Party 
depositing same.  Each Party shall deposit into the Partnership accounts 
designated by the Operating Committee prior to the acquisition of the 
Underlying Properties such Party's share of the Initial Reserve Requirement. 
The Parties shall meet and shall exchange invoices and other evidence of Due 
Diligence, Formation and Acquisition Costs incurred by each of them or their 
Affiliates in connection with the purchase and sale transaction.  Once the 
Parties have agreed upon all Due Diligence, Formation and Acquisition Costs, 
the Party who incurred the lesser amount of Due Diligence, Formation and 
Acquisition Costs shall promptly pay to the other Party an amount sufficient 
to reimburse such other Party for the share of Due Diligence, Formation and 
Acquisition Costs incurred by such other Party in excess of its combined 50% 
share, it being the intention of the Parties that all Due Diligence, 
Formation and Acquisition Costs be shared by the Parties equally.

               (e)  Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained 
in this Agreement, if the Purchase Agreement is terminated or the purchase 
and sale of the Underlying Properties fails to occur, each Party shall bear 
fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate Due Diligence, Formation and Acquisition 
Costs.  If a Party has paid a disproportionate share of the aggregate Due 
Diligence, Formation and Acquisition Costs, the other Party shall pay to such 
Party the amount necessary such that each Party bears such costs in the 
foregoing proportions, which payment shall be made within fifteen (15) days 
after delivery of written notice, together with reasonably detailed 
supporting documentation. Each Party agrees to provide to the other Party 
such documentation as is reasonably necessary to substantiate such costs 
incurred by such Party.  Nothing contained in this SECTION 2.2(e) shall limit 
or impair any right or remedy that a Party may have against any other Party 
as a result of such other Party's breach of any obligation such other Party 
may have under this Agreement to make its Initial Capital Contribution.

          2.3  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS.

               (a)  Additional capital contributions ("ADDITIONAL CAPITAL 
CONTRIBUTIONS") may be called for in accordance with this SECTION 2.3.  The 
Executive Committee may call for Additional Capital Contributions for any 
reason.  Additional Capital Contributions may also be called for by either 
Party if necessary in order to fund Cash Flow Shortfalls or Budgeted Capital 
Items and for no other reason without the approval of the Executive 
Committee.  Except as otherwise provided in SUBSECTION (b) below, Additional 
Capital Contributions shall be made upon written demand by the requesting 
Party upon the other Party, or by the Executive Committee upon the Parties, 
as the case may be, from time to time, shall be 

                                      6
<PAGE>

payable in proportion to the Percentage Interests of the Parties, and shall 
be contributed by the Parties within ten (10) business days of the receipt of 
the notice hereinbefore described, which notice shall state the amount of 
such Additional Capital Contribution required from each Party.

               (b)  Each Party agrees to make all Additional Capital 
Contributions required to be made in accordance with this Agreement within 
the ten (10) business day period described in SUBSECTION (a) above; PROVIDED 
THAT, any Party may, during such ten (10) business day period, request that 
the Partnership seek third party financing (in lieu of the Parties making 
Additional Capital Contributions) to satisfy the Partnership's cash need. In 
the event that either Party makes such request, the period of time within 
which the Additional Capital Contributions must be made will be extended as 
hereinafter provided, and the Partnership shall use its commercially 
reasonable efforts to secure third party financing at commercially reasonable 
rates to satisfy the Partnership's cash needs. If the Partnership is unable 
to secure any such financing on terms that are mutually acceptable to and 
approved by the Parties within thirty (30) days after any Party's request to 
fund the required amounts via third party financing, the Additional Capital 
Contributions shall immediately become due and payable within five (5) 
business days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period. If any 
Party fails to make its share of the Additional Capital Contributions within 
the said five (5) business day period, then the terms and provisions of 
SUBSECTION (c) below shall apply.

               (c)  If a Party fails to make its share of any required 
Additional Capital Contributions after the Partnership has been unable to 
secure third party financing approved by both Parties pursuant to SUBSECTION 
(b) above, then such Party (the "NONCONTRIBUTING PARTY") shall be a 
Defaulting Party hereunder, and the other Party (a "CONTRIBUTING PARTY") who 
has made its share of such Additional Capital Contributions may elect to give 
notice to the Noncontributing Party of its default hereunder. If such 
Noncontributing Party cures such default within the cure period set forth in 
SECTION 5.14(a) hereof, it shall thereupon become a Contributing Party. If 
such Noncontributing Party fails to cure such default within the cure period 
set forth in SECTION 5.14(a) hereof, then the Contributing Party may, in its 
sole discretion and without limitation on its other rights and remedies under 
this Agreement, elect to exercise its rights under the following SUBSECTIONS 
(d) or (e) of this SECTION 2.3 (subject to the terms and conditions set forth 
in said SUBSECTIONS (d) and (e)).

               (d)  The Contributing Party shall have the right to withdraw 
all of its Additional Capital Contribution immediately after the expiration 
of the Noncontributing Party's cure period. Any Contributing Party that 
withdraws its Additional Capital Contribution in compliance with this 
provision shall not be deemed a Defaulting Party by reason of such withdrawal.

               (e)  The Contributing Party shall have the right to make a 
Default Loan to the Partnership pursuant to SECTION 2.4 equal to 100% of the 
Noncontributing Party's share of the Additional Capital Contributions that it 
failed to contribute.

          2.4  DEFAULT LOANS.

               (a)  Without limitation on any other rights and remedies of 
the Partners, if a Noncontributing Party shall have failed to timely pay its 
portion of the Closing Funding Requirement as provided in SECTION 2.2 or to 
make any Additional Capital Contributions as required pursuant to this 
Agreement, and fails to cure such default after receiving notice thereof 
within the applicable cure period provided under SECTION 5.14(a) hereof, the 
Contributing Party may advance the amount of such delinquency to the 
Partnership and direct the Partnership to pay the party or parties (which 
party or parties may be a Partner (or Affiliate of a Partner) hereunder, 
including the Contributing Party (or an Affiliate of the Contributing Party) 
making such advance, if such amount is owed to such Person) to whom the same 
is owed. Any such advance shall be treated as a loan (a "DEFAULT LOAN") by 
such Contributing Party to the Partnership, payable on demand, and shall bear 
interest at the Base Rate plus three percent (3%) per annum (compounded 
monthly as of the last day of each calendar month) from the date of such loan 
to the date of payment in full. In addition and without limitation on the 
foregoing, the making of such Default Loan shall also create an obligation on 
the part of the Noncontributing Party to contribute to the Partnership an 
amount equal to the amount of the Default Loan (together with interest at the 
aforesaid rate) made by the Contributing Party to the Partnership. As used 
herein, the term "BASE RATE" shall mean the commercial loan rate of interest 
announced publicly from time to time by Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, New 
York as such bank's "prime rate", as from time to time in effect, such 
interest rate to change monthly as of the first day of the calendar month 
next succeeding the calendar month in which a change in Base Rate occurs; 
PROVIDED THAT, if such rate is unavailable for any reason, then the parties 
shall meet and agree upon a different bank's "prime rate" or "reference rate" 
to serve as the Base Rate hereunder.

               (b)  The Contributing Party shall give written notice to the 
Noncontributing Party of the making of any Default Loan, and the 
Noncontributing Party may contribute the amount of such advance (plus all 
accrued interest) to the Partnership at any time (and shall contribute such 
amount at the time prescribed by SECTION 10.2 hereof). The Partnership shall 
immediately pay such amounts received from the Noncontributing Party to the 
Contributing Party. Such payments by the Noncontributing Party to the 
Partnership and from the Partnership to the Contributing Party shall be 
applied first against accrued interest and then against the principal of the 
Default Loan until the repayment in full of principal and accrued interest on 
the Default Loan. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, at 
any time when a Default Loan shall be outstanding, all distributions of Net 
Cash Flow by the Partnership from and after the making of such Default Loan 
shall be made as follows: FIRST, all such distributions to which the 
Contributing Party would normally (i.e., but for the effect and operation of 
the provisions set forth in this SECTION 2.4) be entitled to receive under 
SECTION 3.1 shall be calculated and made to such Contributing Party; SECOND, 
the balance, if any, shall be paid by the Partnership directly to the 
Contributing Party to be applied first against interest and then against 
principal of the Default Loan; and THIRD, the balance, if any, shall be paid 
to the Noncontributing Party in respect of the amounts to which it would 
normally (i.e., but for the effect and operation of the provisions set forth 
in this SECTION 2.4) be entitled to receive under SECTION 3.1 (and to the 
extent such amounts, if any, paid to the Noncontributing Party are less than 
the amounts which the Noncontributing Party would normally be entitled to 
receive under SECTION 3.1, such deficiency 


                                       8

<PAGE>

shall forever be forfeited by the Noncontributing Party and it shall have no 
right to recoup or recover the same out of future distributions hereunder). 
Only upon the payment in full of the principal of and all accrued interest on 
a Default Loan shall the Noncontributing Party's Event of Default with 
respect to which the Default Loan was made be deemed cured and after such 
cure, provided no other Event of Default of the Noncontributing Party then 
exists, the Noncontributing Party's rights under this Agreement shall be 
immediately reinstated.

               (c)  Upon request by the Contributing Party at any time from 
the date of the Contributing Party's advance pursuant to SUBSECTION (a) above 
until any such Default Loan shall be repaid in full by cash payment, the 
Noncontributing Party shall, on its own behalf and/or on behalf of the 
Partnership, execute any and all documents reasonably requested by the 
Contributing Party, including, without limitation, promissory notes or such 
other documentation as may be necessary to reflect and perfect the 
Contributing Party's rights under this SECTION 2.4 (and for such purpose the 
Noncontributing Party hereby appoints the Contributing Party its true and 
lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to execute and 
deliver such documents on behalf of such Noncontributing Party, which power 
of attorney shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest which 
cannot be revoked by death, dissolution or otherwise).

          2.5  OTHER MATTERS.

               (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Party 
shall demand or receive a return of its Capital Contributions or withdraw 
from the Partnership without the consent of all Partners. Under circumstances 
requiring a return of any Capital Contributions, no Partner shall have the 
right to receive property other than cash except as may be specifically 
provided herein.

               (b)  No Partner shall receive any interest, salary, or draw 
with respect to its Capital Contributions or its Capital Account or for 
services rendered on behalf of the Partnership or otherwise in its capacity 
as Partner, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. No Partner shall 
be entitled to interest on its Capital Contributions or on such Partner's 
Capital Account.

          2.6  NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY.  No creditor or other third party 
having dealings with the Partnership shall have the right to enforce the 
right or obligation of any Partner to make Capital Contributions or loans or 
to pursue any other right or remedy hereunder or at law or in equity, it 
being understood and agreed that the provisions of this Agreement shall be 
solely for the benefit of, and may be enforced solely by, the parties hereto 
and their respective successors and assigns. None of the rights or 
obligations of the Partners herein set forth to make Capital Contributions to 
the Partnership shall be deemed asset of the Partnership for any purpose by 
any creditor or other third party, nor may such rights or obligations be 
sold, transferred or assigned by the Partnership or pledged or encumbered by 
the Partnership to secure any debt or other obligation of the Partnership or 
of any of the Partners. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a 
deficit capital account of a Partner shall not be deemed to be a liability of 
such Partner nor an asset or property of the Partnership.

          2.7  THIRD PARTY FINANCING.  Except as otherwise provided herein to 
the contrary, the Partnership may obtain, on its own behalf, upon the 
approval of the Executive Committee, all additional money and funds 
necessary, at any time, to develop, construct, acquire and operate the 
Partnership Assets. No Partner or Affiliate of a Partner shall be required to 
guaranty or make any other financial commitment with respect to any debt or 
other obligation of the Partnership. The Operating Committee shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, on behalf of the Partnership, all 
additional money and funds necessary, at any time, to conduct the business of 
the Partnership that cannot be funded through the resources of the 
Partnership.

the Executive Committee of the quarterly statements of Net Cash Flow prepared 
and delivered pursuant to SECTION 4.3, the Partnership shall distribute such

covered by each such statement as the Executive Committee or Operating 
Committee may elect to distribute (which shall not, in any event, equal less 
than ninety percent (90%) of the total Funds From Operations for such 
quarterly period), to the Partners pro rata in accordance with their 
respective Percentage Interests, subject to the alternative allocations set 
forth in SECTION 2.4(b) in the event that a Default Loan is then outstanding. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive Committee shall approve for each 
period a distribution sufficient to satisfy the requirements of SECTION 
5.6(f) hereof.

          3.2  DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER DISSOLUTION.  Notwithstanding the 
provisions of SECTION 3.1 to the contrary, all distributions of Net Cash Flow 
to be made from and after the dissolution of the Partnership shall be made in 
accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE 10.

          3.3  TIMING OF DISTRIBUTIONS AMONG PARTNERS.  Except as provided in 
SECTION 6.3, all distributions of cash shall be distributed to the Persons

true and accurate record of all costs and expenses incurred, all charges 
made, all credits made and received, and all income derived in connection 
with the operation of the Partnership business in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles consistently applied and, to the extent 
inconsistent therewith, in accordance with this Agreement. The Partnership 
shall use the accrual method of accounting in preparation of its annual 
reports and for tax purposes and shall keep its book accordingly. Each 
Partner shall, at its sole expense, have the right, at any time, without 
notice to any other Partner, to examine, copy, and audit the Partnership's 
books and records during normal business hours.

          4.3  REPORTS.

calculation of the Net Cash Flow (if any) for such prior quarterly period, 
and setting forth the calculation of all amounts to be distributed to the 
Partners pursuant to SECTION 3.1 or SECTION 10.2, as the case may be. Annual

Affiliates under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All 
quarterly and annual statements shall be subject to the approval of the 
Executive Committee, and no action shall be taken with respect thereto until

the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Partnership.

          4.5  SPECIAL BASIS ADJUSTMENT.  In connection with any Transfer of 
a Partnership Interest permitted under ARTICLE 6, the Operating Committee

                                  MANAGEMENT

          5.1  EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  The Partnership shall at all times have 
an executive committee (the "EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE") composed of two 
individuals (the "EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS") who shall vote on Major 
Decisions and oversee the performance of the Operating Committee.

               (a)  MEMBERSHIP AND VOTING.

                    (i)  MEMBERSHIP.  The Executive Committee will consist of
     two (2) Executive Committee Members, with one (1) Executive Committee
     Member appointed by each General Partner. Concurrently with the execution
     and delivery of this Agreement, the General Partners have notified one
     another in writing of their respective initial appointed Executive
     Committee Member. Each General Partner may, at any time, appoint an
     alternate Executive Committee Member by prior written notice to the other
     General Partner's appointed Executive Committee Member and such alternates
     will have all the powers, authority and duties of a regular Executive
     Committee Member in the absence 


                                       12

<PAGE>

     or inability of a regular Executive Committee Member to serve. In no 
     event, however, shall the other Executive Committee Member be under any 
     obligation to make inquiries as to, or verify or confirm, any such 
     absence or inability to serve of a regular Executive Committee Member, 
     it being understood and agreed that the Executive Committee Members 
     shall be entitled to rely upon and accept an alternate Executive 
     Committee Member's assertion of the absence or inability to serve of the 
     regular Executive Committee Member in question. Each General Partner 
     shall cause its appointed Executive Committee Member and alternate 
     Executive Committee Member to comply with the terms of this Agreement. 
     Each General Partner will have the power to remove its Executive 
     Committee Member or alternate Executive Committee Member appointed by it 
     by written notice to the other General Partner's Executive Committee 
     Member. Vacancies on the Executive Committee will be filled by 
     appointment by the General Partner that appointed the Executive 
     Committee Member previously holding the position that is then vacant. 
     The General Partners may mutually agree to increase or decrease the size 
     of the Executive Committee proportionately, from time to time. Notices 
     to an Executive Committee Member shall be delivered to such Person's 
     attention at the address set forth in SECTION 2.1 for the General 
     Partner that appointed such Executive Committee Member, and in the 
     manner prescribed in SECTION 11.1. No appointment or removal by a 
     General Partner of an Executive Committee Member or alternate Executive 
     Committee Member shall be effective until written notice of such action 
     is received or deemed received pursuant to SECTION 11.1 by the Executive 
     Committee Member of the other General Partner.  Each General Partner, 
     its Limited Partner affiliate, and its respective Executive Committee 
     Member and alternate Executive Committee Member, when dealing with the 
     other General Partner's respective Executive Committee Member and 
     alternate Executive Committee Member, (i) shall be entitled to rely upon 
     and accept the written act, approval, consent or vote of each of such 
     other General Partner's then-appointed Executive Committee Member and 
     alternate Executive Committee Member, and (ii) shall be under no 
     obligation to make any inquiries in order to verify or confirm any of 
     such written acts, approvals, consents or votes.

               (ii) VOTING.  Each Executive Committee Member shall have one 
     vote on any decision of the Executive Committee. An Executive Committee 
     Member may give a written proxy to another Executive Committee Member to 
     vote on such Executive Committee Member's behalf in such Executive 
     Committee Member's absence. Except as expressly provided to the contrary 
     in this Agreement, all actions, decisions, capital calls, 
     determinations, waivers, approvals and consents to be taken or given by 
     the Executive Committee must be unanimously approved by the Executive 
     Committee Members (whether or not present at the meeting at which such 
     vote occurs).

               (b)  MEETINGS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE; TIME AND PLACE.  
Unless otherwise agreed by the Executive Committee, regular meetings of the 
Executive Committee shall be held no less often than quarterly at such time 
and at such place as the Executive Committee shall determine. At such regular 
meetings, the Operating Committee shall report on the financial performance 
and condition of the Partnership on a year-to-date basis (including cash 
flows, reserves, outstanding loans, and compliance efforts), progress on 
capital projects, material 


                                       13

contracts entered into, material litigation, marketing and leasing efforts, 
deviations from any Budget and such other matters relevant to the management 
and operation of the Partnership and the Properties. Special meetings of the 
Executive Committee shall be held on the call of any Executive Committee 
Member; provided that at least three (3) business days' notice is given to 
all Executive Committee Members (unless written waiver of this requirement by 
all Executive Committee Members is obtained). A quorum for any Executive 
Committee meeting shall consist of not less than two (2) Executive Committee 
Members (one appointed by each General Partner) present either in person or 
by proxy. The Executive Committee may make use of telephones and other 
electronic devices to hold meetings; provided that the Executive Committee 
Members participating in such meeting can hear one another. The Executive 
Committee may act without a meeting if the action taken is reduced to writing 
and approved by the Executive Committee in accordance with the other voting 
provisions of this Agreement. Written minutes shall be taken at each meeting 
of the Executive Committee. However, any action taken or matter agreed upon 
by the Executive Committee shall be deemed final, whether or not written 
minutes are ever prepared or finalized. 

               (c)  MAJOR DECISIONS.  No action shall be taken, no sum shall 
be expended and no obligation shall be incurred by the Operating Committee or 
any property manager with respect to any matter affecting the Partnership 
which is within the scope of a Major Decision unless such Major Decision 
shall have been approved by the Executive Committee in advance in writing. A 
"MAJOR DECISION" shall mean any decision: 

                    (i)   to sell, assign, transfer, exchange, grant easements
     over, or otherwise convey or dispose of, any of the Partnership Properties,

     Partnership Assets or any portion thereof or any interest therein, except
     as otherwise may be provided in an approved Budget;

                    (vi)  to approve proposals submitted to, or agreements

     with federal or state taxing authorities;

                    (ix)   to change or permit to be changed in any substantial

     management of the Partnership pursuant to this Agreement;

                    (x)    to compromise or settle any claim for insurance
     proceeds, or any claim for payment of awards or damages arising out of the
     exercise of eminent domain by any public or governmental authority;

                    (xi)   to make, execute or deliver on behalf of the
     Partnership any assignment for the benefit of creditors;

                    (xii)  to dissolve, terminate or liquidate the
     Partnership, or to petition a court for the dissolution, termination or
     liquidation of the Partnership, except in accordance with this Agreement;

                    (xiii) to cause the Partnership, or any of the
     Partnership Properties to be subject to the authority of any trustee,
     custodian or receiver or to be subject to any proceeding for bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debt, relief of
     debtors, or similar proceedings; 

                    (xiv)  to obligate the Partnership as a surety,
     guarantor, indemnitor or accommodation party to any obligation;

                    (xv)   to enter into, terminate, accept the surrender of,

          5.3  OPERATING COMMITTEE.  Unless otherwise agreed to by the 
General Partners, the management of the Partnership, subject to the 
restrictions on its authority set forth in SECTION 5.1, shall be vested in 
the operating committee (the "OPERATING COMMITTEE"). The Operating Committee 
shall be composed of two individuals (the "OPERATING COMMITTEE MEMBERS") who 
shall vote on all management issues relating to the business and operations 
of the Partnership.

               (a)  MEMBERSHIP AND VOTING.

                    (i)  MEMBERSHIP.  The Operating Committee will consist of
     two (2) Operating Committee Members, with one (1) Operating Committee
     Member appointed by each General Partner. Concurrently with the execution
     and delivery of this Agreement, the General Partners have notified one
     another in writing of their respective initial appointed Operating
     Committee Member. Each General Partner may, at any time, appoint one of
     its employees as an alternate Operating Committee Member by prior written
     notice to the other General Partner's appointed Operating Committee Member
     and such alternates will have all the powers, authority and duties of a
     regular Operating Committee Member in the absence or inability of a regular
     Operating Committee Member to serve. In no event, however, shall the other
     Operating Committee Member be under any obligation to make inquiries as to,
     or verify or confirm, any such absence or inability to serve of a regular
     Operating Committee Member, it being understood and agreed that the
     Operating Committee Members shall be entitled to rely upon and accept an
     alternate Operating Committee Member's assertion of the absence or
     inability to serve of the regular Operating Committee Member in question. 
     Each General Partner shall cause its appointed Operating Committee Member
     and alternate Operating Committee Member to comply with the terms of this
     Agreement. Each General Partner will have the power to remove its
     Operating Committee Member or alternate Operating Committee Member
     appointed by it by written notice to the other General Partner's Operating
     Committee Member. Vacancies on the Operating Committee will be filled by
     appointment by the General Partner that appointed the Operating Committee
     Member previously holding the position that is then vacant. The General
     Partners may mutually agree to increase or decrease the size of the
     Operating Committee proportionately, from time to time. Notices to an
     Operating Committee Member shall be delivered to such Person's attention at
     the address set forth in SECTION 2.1 for the General Partner that appointed
     such Operating Committee Member, and in the manner prescribed in SECTION
     11.1.  No appointment or removal by a General Partner of an Operating
     Committee Member or alternate Operating Committee Member shall be effective
     until written notice of such action is received or deemed received pursuant
     to SECTION 11.1 by the Operating Committee Member of the other General
     Partner.  Each General Partner, its Limited Partner affiliate, and its
     respective Operating Committee Member and alternate Operating Committee
     Member, when dealing with the other General Partner's respective Operating
     Committee Member and alternate Operating Committee Member, (i) shall be
     entitled to rely upon and accept the written act, approval, consent or vote
     of each of such other General Partner's then-appointed Operating Committee
     Member and alternate Operating Committee Member, and (ii) shall


                                       16


<PAGE>

     be under no obligation to make any inquiries in order to verify or confirm 
     any of such written acts, approvals, consents or votes. 

                    (ii)  VOTING.  Each Operating Committee Member shall have 
     one vote on any decision of the Operating Committee.  An Operating 
     Committee Member may give a written proxy to another Operating Committee 
     Member or any Partner's employee to vote on such Operating Committee 
     Member's behalf in such Operating Committee Member's absence.  Except as 
     expressly provided to the contrary in this Agreement, all actions, 
     decisions, capital calls, determinations, waivers, approvals and consents 
     to be taken or given by the Operating Committee must be unanimously 
     approved by the Operating Committee Members (whether or not present at the 
     meeting at which such vote occurs).

               (b)  REPORTS AND MEETINGS OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE; TIME AND 
PLACE.  The Operating Committee shall report to the Executive Committee on 
activities undertaken by the Operating Committee, as required by the Executive 
Committee and this Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed by the Operating 
Committee, regular meetings of the Operating Committee shall be held monthly at 
such time and at such place as the Operating Committee shall determine.  
Special meetings of the Operating Committee shall be held on the call of any 
Operating Committee Member; provided that at least three (3) business days' 
notice is given to all Operating Committee Members (unless written waiver of 
this requirement by all Operating Committee Members is obtained).  A quorum for 
any Operating Committee meeting shall consist of not less than two (2) 
Operating Committee Members (one appointed by each General Partner) present 
either in person or by proxy.  The Operating Committee may make use of 
telephones and other electronic devices to hold meetings; provided that the 
Operating Committee Members participating in such meeting can hear one another. 
The Operating Committee may act without a meeting if the action taken is 
reduced to writing and approved by the Operating Committee in accordance with 
the other voting provisions of this Agreement.  Written minutes shall be taken 
at each meeting of the Operating Committee.  However, any action taken or 
matter agreed upon by the Operating Committee shall be deemed final, whether or 
not written minutes are ever prepared or finalized.  Operating Committee 
meetings may be attended by persons other than the Operating Committee Members 
(including other employees of the Partners and their Affiliates).

               (c)  DUTIES OF THE OPERATING COMMITTEE.  The Operating Committee 
shall be generally responsible for overseeing and managing the day-to-day 
business, operations and affairs of the Partnership and carrying out the duties 
delegated to it by the Executive Committee, and shall have fiduciary 
responsibility for the safekeeping and use of all funds and assets of the 
Partnership, whether or not in its immediate possession or control.  The 
Operating Committee may, in carrying out its duties, defend against lawsuits or 
other judicial or administrative proceedings brought against the Partnership, 
provided that it promptly notifies the Executive Committee of such action.  The 
funds of the Partnership shall not be commingled with the funds of any other 
Person, and the Operating Committee shall not employ, or permit any other 
Person to employ, such funds in any manner except for the benefit of the 
Partnership. The bank accounts of the Partnership shall be maintained in such 
banking institutions as are approved


                                      17
<PAGE>

by the Operating Committee and withdrawals shall be made only in the regular 
course of Partnership business and as otherwise authorized in this Agreement on 
such signature or signatures as the Operating Committee may determine.  The 
Operating Committee shall also have the duties imposed upon it elsewhere in 
this Agreement.  The Operating Committee shall devote sufficient time, effort 
and managerial resources to the business of the Partnership as is reasonably 
required to fulfill its obligations hereunder.

          5.4  WARRANTED RELIANCE BY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND OPERATING 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON OTHERS.  In exercising their authority and performing 
their duties under this Agreement, the Executive Committee Members and the 
Operating Committee Members shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, 
reports, or statements of the following persons or groups unless they have 
actual knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such 
reliance to be unwarranted:

               (a)  one or more agents of the Partnership whom the Executive 
Committee Member or Operating Committee Member, as the case may be, reasonably 
believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; and

               (b)  any attorney, public accountant, or other person as to 
matters which the Executive Committee Member or Operating Committee Member, as 
the case may be, reasonably believes to be within such person's professional or 
expert competence.

          5.5  INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

          5.6  REIT STATUS.  The Partners hereby acknowledge that Macerich and 
SDG (and/or certain Persons directly or indirectly owning interests in Macerich 
or SDG) are and intend to qualify at all times as a REIT, and that each such 
Partner's or other Person's ability to qualify as such will depend principally 
upon the nature of the Partnership's operations.  Accordingly, the 
Partnership's operations shall be conducted at all times in a manner that will 
enable each of Macerich, SDG and each Person owning, directly or indirectly, 
interests in either Macerich or SDG to satisfy all requirements for REIT status 
under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and the regulations promulgated 
thereunder to the extent possible.  In furtherance of the foregoing (and not in 
limitation thereof), notwithstanding any other provision herein to the 
contrary, the Partnership shall conduct its operations in accordance with the 
following provisions at all times:

               (a)  The Partnership shall not render any services to any lessee 
or sublessee or any customer thereof, either directly or through an 
"independent contractor" within the meaning of Section 856(d)(3) of the Code, 
if the rendering of such services shall cause all or any part of the rents 
received by the Partnership to fail to qualify as "rents from real property" 
within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code;

               (b)  The Partnership shall not own, directly or indirectly 
(taking into account the attribution rules referred to in Section 856(d)(5) of 
the Code), in the aggregate 10% or more of the total number of shares of all 
classes of stock, 10% or more of the voting power


                                      18
<PAGE>

of all classes of voting stock or 10% or more of the assets or net profits of 
any lessee or sublessee of all or any part of any of the Properties or any 
Partnership Property;

              (c)  No lease or sublease of any space at the Properties shall 
provide for any rent based in whole or in part on the "income or profits" 
within the meaning of Section 856(d)(2)(A) of the Code derived by any lessee or 
sublessee;

              (d)  The Partnership shall not own more than 10% of the 
outstanding voting securities of any one issuer (as determined for purposes of 
Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code);

              (e)  Neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall take any action
(or fail to take any action permitted under this Agreement) that would 
otherwise cause the Partnership's and Underlying Partnership's gross income to 
consist of more than one percent (1%) of income not described in Section 
856(c)(2) of the Code or more than ten percent (10%) of income not described in 
Section 856(c)(3) of the Code, or cause any significant part of the Partnership 
Assets to consist of assets other than "real estate assets" within the meaning 
of Section 856(c)(6)(B) of the Code;

               (f)  The Partnership shall distribute to the Partners during each
Fiscal Year an amount of cash such that the portion so distributed will equal 
or exceed 100% of the amount of Partnership taxable income, if any, to be 
allocated to the Partners with respect to such Fiscal Year distributed at the 
times required to prevent the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4981 of 
the Code; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if each such Partner's distributable share of 
any Net Cash Flow of the Partnership and its distributable share of any funds 
maintained in the Partnership reserves are insufficient to meet the aforesaid 
distribution requirement with respect to such Partner, then the Partnership 
shall have satisfied the foregoing distribution requirement with respect to 
such Partner upon distributing to it such distributable share of Net Cash Flow 
and funds maintained in the Partnership reserves.  In no event shall the 
Partnership be required to borrow funds, or any Partner be required to 
contribute funds to the Partnership, in order to permit the Partnership to 
satisfy the foregoing distribution requirement.  In no event shall the 
foregoing provisions of this SUBSECTION (f) adversely affect the allocation of, 
and Percentage Interest in, Net Cash Flow of any other Partner.

               (g)  The Partnership shall not engage in any "prohibited 
transactions" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6)(B)(iii) of the Code.

The Partners hereby acknowledge that the foregoing are the current guidelines 
applicable to the qualification of REITs.  If and to the extent that any of the 
requirements to qualify for REIT status shall be changed, altered, modified or 
added to, then such changes, alterations, modifications or additions, as 
applicable, shall be deemed incorporated herein, and this SECTION 5.6 shall be 
deemed to be amended and modified as necessary to incorporate such changed, 
altered, modified or added REIT requirements.

          5.7  BUDGETS.

               (a)  PREPARATION AND APPROVAL.  As soon as reasonably possible 
hereafter, the Operating Committee shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and 
submit to the Executive Committee for approval an interim operating budget 
(each an "INTERIM OPERATING BUDGET") for the management, leasing and operation 
of each Partnership Property through the end of Fiscal Year 1998.  At least 
forty-five (45) days prior to the beginning of each Fiscal Year, the Operating 
Committee shall prepare and submit to the Executive Committee for approval a 
proposed budget (each an "ANNUAL BUDGET") for the management, leasing and 
operation of each Partnership Property for the next Fiscal Year.  The Interim 
Operating Budgets and Annual Operating Budgets shall sometimes hereinafter be 
collectively referred to individually as a "BUDGET" and collectively as the 
"BUDGETS".  The Executive Committee may approve or disapprove the entire Budget 
or certain cost items or categories of each Budget.  If the Executive Committee 
disapproves any Budget or any cost item or category thereof, the Operating 
Committee shall meet within five (5) business days after the Executive 
Committee's disapproval and seek in good faith to agree upon an acceptable 
revision to such disapproved Budget(s) or cost item or category, as the case 
may be.  Once revised, each such disapproved Budget shall be resubmitted to the 
Executive Committee for approval and such process shall continue until the 
Executive Committee has approved a Budget for each Partnership Property for the 
Fiscal Year in question.  Such Budgets will be prepared by the Operating 
Committee and approved by the Executive Committee in good faith based upon 
estimates taking into account the most recent information then available to the 
Operating Committee.  The Operating Committee shall update each Budget no less 
frequently than quarterly, and shall promptly submit any proposed revisions to 
such Budgets resulting from such updates to the Executive Committee for 
approval in the manner provided above for approval of the original Budgets.

               (b)  OPERATIONS.  The approved Budget for each Partnership 
Property shall be submitted to the property manager for such Partnership 
Property for implementation.  The Operating Committee and property managers 
shall manage and operate each Property and each Partnership Property consistent 
with the approved Budget therefor (as may be updated from time to time in 
accordance with SUBSECTION (a) above).  If the Executive Committee has not 
approved a Budget or any cost item or category of any Budget prior to the 
beginning of the next Fiscal Year, the Operating Committee shall substitute the 
Budget or the actual cost of such disapproved item or category incurred by the 
Partnership during the preceding Fiscal Year, if any; PROVIDED THAT, if any 
such item or category of expense is in the nature of utility expenses, personal 
or real property taxes, insurance expenses to be incurred in accordance with 
SECTION 5.8 hereof, debt service due and payable under any loan of the 
Partnership, or any payments that the Partnership is required to make by law, 
then the Operating Committee shall substitute the reasonably anticipated costs 
of such items or categories of expense (based on the previous year's bills 
therefor, if available).


                                      20

          5.8  INSURANCE.

               (a)  COVERAGE.  The Operating Committee shall procure and
maintain, or cause to be procured and maintained, insurance sufficient to enable
the Partnership to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual
requirements (including the requirements of Persons providing financing to the
Partnership), including as a minimum, the following:

                    (i)   Comprehensive general liability insurance covering 
     each Partnership Property in the amounts and upon terms customary for 
     businesses and assets comparable to such Partnership Property, and 
     otherwise satisfactory to the Executive Committee;

                    (ii)  With respect to completed improvements, fire and
     extended coverage insurance, and, whenever construction of any improvement
     is taking place, builders' risk insurance, in each case, on a replacement
     cost basis of not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the full
     replacement cost of such improvements;

                    (iii) Worker's compensation insurance as required by law
     including employer's liability;

                    (iv)  Fidelity insurance in an amount to protect against
     losses due to employee dishonesty, theft by any other Partnership
     contractor, and mysterious disappearances; and

                    (v)   Such additional insurance against other risks of loss
     to the Partnership Properties as, from time to time, may be required by any
     lender making a loan to the Partnership or which may be required by law.

              The Operating Committee shall furnish the Executive Committee, no 
less frequently than annually, a schedule of such insurance and copies of 
certificates evidencing the same.  The Executive Committee must consent to the 
establishment or modification of any self insurance or deductibles which 
exposes the Partnership to uninsured liability.  Each Partner shall be named as 
an additional insured to the Partnership's comprehensive general liability 
insurance policies.

          5.9  UNANIMOUS CONSENT.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Partnership may take any action contemplated under this
Agreement if approved by the unanimous consent of the General Partners.

          5.10 INDEMNIFICATION.

               (a)  The Partnership shall, to the fullest extent permitted by 
law, indemnify any and all Indemnitees from and against any and all losses, 
claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and 
costs), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts arising from any and 
all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil,


                                      21
<PAGE>

criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the 
Partnership as set forth in this Agreement in which any Indemnitee may be 
involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, unless it 
is established that:  (i) the act or omission of the Indemnitee was material to 
the matter giving rise to the claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding and 
either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate 
dishonesty; (ii) the Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit 
in money, property or services; or (iii) in the case of any criminal 
proceeding, the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that the act or 
omission was unlawful.  Any indemnification pursuant to this SECTION 5.10 shall 
be made only out of Partnership Assets, and no Partner shall be required to 
contribute or advance funds to the Partnership to enable the Partnership to 
satisfy its obligations under this SECTION 5.10.

               (b)  Reasonable expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party
to a proceeding shall be paid or reimbursed by the Partnership in advance of 
the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of (i) 
a written affirmation by the Indemnitee of the Indemnitee's good faith belief 
that it is entitled to indemnification by the Partnership pursuant to this 
SECTION 5.10(b) with respect to such expenses and proceeding, and (ii) a 
written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee, to and in favor of the 
Partnership, wherein the Indemnitee agrees to repay the amount if it shall 
ultimately be adjudged not to have been entitled to indemnification under this 
SECTION 5.10.

               (c)  The indemnification provided by this SECTION 5.10 shall be 
in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may 
be entitled under any agreement, as a matter of law or otherwise.

               (d)  The Partnership may purchase and maintain insurance, on 
behalf of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the Partners shall mutually 
determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that 
may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnership's activities, 
regardless of whether the Partnership would have the obligation to indemnify 
such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

               (e)  The provisions of this SECTION 5.10 are for the benefit of 
the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall 
not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

          5.11 COMPENSATION AND REIMBURSEMENT.  The Partnership shall not pay a 
Partner or an Affiliate of a Partner any fees or other compensation except as 
set forth in this Agreement or except as otherwise agreed by the Executive 
Committee.  The Partnership will reimburse a Partner and its Affiliates for all 
reasonable actual out-of-pocket third party expenses incurred in connection 
with the carrying out of the duties set forth in this Agreement imposed upon 
such Partner or its Affiliates, provided such expenses are approved by the 
Executive Committee or are reflected in a Budget that has been approved by the 
Executive Committee, in each case upon the presentation of reasonable 
supporting documentation of the amount and purpose of such expenses.


                                      22

          5.12 NO EMPLOYEES.  The Partnership shall not have employees.  Each 
Partner shall be solely responsible for all wages, benefits, insurance and 
payroll taxes with respect to any of its respective Executive Committee 
Members, Operating Committee Members or other employees.

          5.13 PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT.  The Partners acknowledge and agree 
that except for their respective economic interests in the Partnership, each 
Partner's respective rights, powers and privileges as a Partner hereunder shall 
be deemed to be in respect of a personal services contract, and not an 
executory contract, under the United States Bankruptcy Code and any state 
insolvency or bankruptcy laws.  Without limitation on the foregoing, each 
Partner confirms and agrees that one of the major factors that caused the 
Partners to form this Partnership and to enter into this Agreement was the 
personal trust and confidence each Partner reposed in the personal services, 
management skills and business experience of the other Partner.  The Partners 
do not desire to, and agree that they shall not be required to, accept the 
exercise of management or control rights (including rights to give approvals or 
consents under this Agreement) by any party other than a Partner.  Accordingly, 
in the event of a Bankruptcy of a General Partner or the withdrawal of a 
General Partner, such General Partner's Operating Committee Members and 
Executive Committee Members shall immediately be terminated and deemed removed 
from the Operating Committee and Executive Committee, respectively, and such 
General Partner shall have no right whatsoever to participate in the management 
or control of the Partnership; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such General Partner 
shall be entitled to all of the rights and benefits of an assignee of a 
partnership interest under the Act.

          5.14 Defaults and Remedies.

               (a)  EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  The occurrence of any of the following 
events by or with respect to a Partner of one Party or such Party (the 
"DEFAULTING PARTY"; and the other Party shall be referred to herein as a 
"NON-DEFAULTING PARTY," provided that neither a Partner of the other Party nor 
the other Party itself is already a Defaulting Party) shall be a default 
hereunder and if not cured within the applicable notice and cure period 
provided below, if any, such default shall constitute an "EVENT OF DEFAULT" 
hereunder:

                    (i)   The failure of a Partner or Party to make any payment
     as required by this Agreement that is not cured within five (5) business
     days of written notice to such Partner or Party;

                    (ii)  The failure of a Partner or Party to perform any of 
     its other obligations under this Agreement or the breach by a Partner or 
     Party of any of the terms of this Agreement, and a continuation of such 
     failure or breach for more than thirty (30) days after notice by a 
     Non-defaulting Party to the Defaulting Partner that such Defaulting Party 
     has failed to perform any of its obligations under, or has breached, this 
     Agreement; provided that if such failure or breach is of the nature that it
     can be cured but cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day 
     period, such period shall be extended for up to an additional sixty (60) 
     days so long as the Defaulting Party in good faith commences all reasonable
     curative efforts within ten (10) days of its receipt of such notice


                                      23
<PAGE>

     from the Non-defaulting Party and diligently and expeditiously continues 
     its curative efforts to completion; or

                    (iii) The occurrence of a Bankruptcy with respect to a
     Partner or the withdrawal by a Partner.

               (b)  REMEDIES.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the
Non-defaulting Party may elect to do one or more of the following:

                    (i)   Exercise its rights under SECTION 5.14(c);

                    (ii)  Dissolve the Partnership and commence to liquidate 
     its assets as provided in ARTICLE 10;

                    (iii) Enforce any covenant by the Defaulting Party to
     advance money or to take or forbear from any other action hereunder; or

                    (iv)  Pursue any other remedy permitted by this Agreement 
     or at law or in equity.

               (c)  CHANGE OF GOVERNANCE OF PARTNERSHIP.  In addition to any
other rights or remedies which a Non-defaulting Party may have under this
Agreement or under applicable laws with respect to an Event of Default, a
Non-defaulting Party shall have the option to exercise the rights set forth
below in this SECTION 5.14(c) in the event of the occurrence of any Event of
Default.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the General Partner of the
Non-defaulting Party may elect, by giving written notice to the Defaulting
Party, to assume the role of the "CONTROLLING PARTY" of the Partnership, and
shall remain as such unless and until (i) the Partners otherwise agree,
(ii) such Controlling Party is removed as such pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this SECTION 5.14(c) by reason of its having become a Defaulting
Party, or (iii) such Event of Default is cured.  During the period of time that
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the General Partner of the
Controlling Party shall have the authority to take exclusive charge and control
of the Partnership free and clear of any and all restrictions (including any and
all restrictions set forth in this ARTICLE 5 and any and all consent, voting or
approval rights granted the Executive Committee, Operating Committee or any
Partner, other than that of the Controlling Party) imposed by this Agreement,
and the Defaulting Party's right to, acting alone, make certain decisions and
take certain actions with respect to matters concerning the Partnership's
management agreements with the Non-defaulting Party (or its Affiliates) as
provided in SECTION 5.5 shall be suspended and the General Partner of the
Controlling Party shall make all such decisions and take all such actions
thereunder.  The General Partner of the Controlling Party shall have the right
to amend any fictitious business name statement, certificate of partnership, or
any similar document to reflect such election and to provide that it is the sole
Partner authorized to bind the Partnership, and to file or record any such
amended documents and change the Partnership's Principal Office, and each
Partner hereby grants to the General Partner of the Controlling Party its
irrevocable power of attorney to do the same, which power of attorney shall be
deemed to be a power coupled with an interest which may not be revoked until


                                      24
<PAGE>

the termination and winding up of the Partnership.  The provisions of this 
SECTION 5.14(c) shall take precedence over any provision to the contrary set 
forth in this Agreement.

               (d)  REMEDIES NOT eXCLUSIVE.  No remedy conferred upon the
Partnership or any Partner in this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any
other remedy herein or by law provided or permitted, but rather each shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now
or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute.


                                      ARTICLE 6

                                Transfers of Interests

          6.1  RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERS.

               (a)  Except as permitted in SECTION 6.1(b) or otherwise expressly
permitted or required by this Agreement, no Partner shall Transfer all or any 
portion of its Partnership Interest, and no partner or other controlling entity 
or Person of a Partner shall directly or indirectly Transfer its ownership 
interest in such Partner or take any action which would have such an effect, 
without the unanimous prior written consent of the Partners, which consent may 
be withheld by a Partner in its sole and absolute discretion.  Any Transfer or 
attempted Transfer by any Partner in violation of the preceding sentence shall 
be null and void and of no force or effect whatsoever.  Each Partner hereby 
acknowledges the reasonableness of the restrictions on Transfer imposed by this 
Agreement in view of the Partnership purposes and the relationship of the 
Partners and the Partnership.  Accordingly, the restrictions on Transfer 
contained herein shall be specifically enforceable.  Each Partner hereby 
further agrees to hold the Partnership and each Partner wholly and completely 
harmless from any cost, liability, or damage (including liabilities for income 
taxes and costs of enforcing this indemnity) incurred by any of such 
indemnified Persons as a result of a Transfer or an attempted Transfer in 
violation of this Agreement.

               (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, 
the following Transfers shall be permitted under this Agreement without any 
consent being required from any Partner ("PERMITTED TRANSFERS"):

                    (i)   Any Transfer of the entire Partnership Interest to an
     Affiliate of the respective Operating Partnership of the Partner, provided
     that the applicable Operating Partnership has a direct or indirect legal or
     beneficial ownership interest entitled to receive at least 25% of the
     dividends, distributions or other cash proceeds of such Affiliate;

                    (ii)  Any transaction involving (1) the Transfer, issuance 
     or redemption of stock or other equity securities of any direct or indirect
     corporate partner of a Partner, whether or not such Transfer, issuance or
     redemption occurs on any public stock exchange, (2) the Transfer, issuance
     or redemption of any partnership units in the


                                      25
<PAGE>

     respective Operating Partnership of the Partner, or (3) the direct or 
     indirect Transfer, issuance or redemption of limited partnership interests 
     in any Partner; PROVIDED THAT following any such transaction referred to in
     (1) - (3) of this SUBSECTION (ii), the entire Partnership Interest is owned
     by an Affiliate of the applicable Operating Partnership and the applicable 
     Operating Partnership continues to have a direct or indirect legal or 
     beneficial ownership interest entitled to receive at least 25% of the 
     dividends, distributions or other cash proceeds of such Affiliate. 

          6.2  TRANSFEREE REQUIREMENTS.  In no event may any Partner Transfer 
its Partnership Interest pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE 6 or 
otherwise (i) to any person who lacks the legal right, power or capacity to own 
a Partnership Interest; (ii) in violation of any provision of any mortgage or 
deed of trust (or note or bond secured thereby) constituting a lien against any 
Partnership Property or any part thereof, or of any other instrument, document 
or agreement to which the Partnership is a party or otherwise bound; (iii) in 
violation of applicable law; (iv) in the event such Transfer or issuance would 
cause any Partner who is a REIT (or any Person who, directly or indirectly, 
owns an interest in any Partner who is a REIT) to cease to comply with the 
requirements necessary to achieve REIT status; (v) if such Transfer would cause 
a termination of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes or would cause 
a constructive distribution to any Partner or to any partner of the Underlying 
Partnership under Section 752 of the Code; (vi) if such Transfer would, in the 
opinion of counsel to the Partnership, cause the Partnership to cease to be 
classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes; (vii) if such 
Transfer would cause the Partnership to become, with respect to any employee 
benefit plan subject to Title 1 of ERISA, a "party-in-interest" (as defined in 
Section 3(14) of ERISA) or a "disqualified person" (as defined in Section 
4975(c) of the Code); or (xiii) if such Transfer would, in the opinion of 
counsel to the Partnership, cause any portion of the Partnership Properties to 
constitute assets of any employee benefit plan pursuant to the Department of 
Labor Regulations Section 2510.2-101.  As used in this Agreement, the term 
"TRANSFEREE" shall mean any approved Transferee pursuant to ARTICLE 6 hereof.

          6.3  PARTNERSHIP INTEREST LOANS.

               (a)  GENERAL LOAN PROVISIONS.  Each Partner shall have the right 
to pledge its entire Partnership Interest, and the proceeds thereof as security 
for a loan or loans (or a guaranty of a loan or loans to its partner or other 
controlling Entity or Person) under a credit facility and all other obligations 
under the related loan documents (collectively, a "PARTNERSHIP INTEREST LOAN 
OBLIGATIONS") and to obtain such loan or loans secured by its Partnership 
Interest and the proceeds thereof (all loans under a single credit facility 
being, collectively, a "PARTNERSHIP INTEREST LOAN") at any time during the term 
of this Agreement upon the following terms and conditions:

                    (i)  there shall never be more than one Partnership Interest
     Loan with respect to each Partner's Partnership Interest outstanding at any
     time;


                                      26

<PAGE>

                    (ii) the Partnership Interest Loan Obligations may be
     secured by the Partner's Partnership Interest and the proceeds thereof but
     shall not be secured by or in any way collateralized by any of the
     Properties;

                    (iii) the Partnership Interest Loan shall be prepayable
     in full at any time, subject to customary notice and prepayment penalties;

                    (iv) the Partner obtaining or guaranteeing any such
     Partnership Interest Loan shall pay each other Partner's reasonable
     attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the review of the loan
     documents for each such Partnership Interest Loan with respect to the
     compliance of such loan documents with the conditions set forth in this
     SECTION 6.3;

                    (v)  At the time such Partnership Interest Loan is incurred,
     no default or Event of Default by or with respect to the Partner obtaining
     the Partnership Interest Loan shall have occurred and be continuing under
     this Agreement;

                    (vi) The lender or lenders under each such Partnership
     Interest Loan shall be a bank, or other institutional lender, provided that
     in the case of a Partnership Interest Loan made by more than one lender (or
     in which there are one or more participants), the Partners and the
     Partnership shall be entitled to deal only with an agent or other
     representative for all such lenders (and their participants, if any, or, in
     the case of a Partnership Interest Loan held by a single lender in which
     there are one or more participants, shall be entitled to deal only with
     such lender) in connection with such Partnership Interest Loan and any
     notice given to such representative (or lender) shall be deemed notice to
     all lenders and participants, and any consent or approval by such
     representative (or lender) shall be deemed given by all lenders and
     participants);

                    (vii)     The other Partners shall be reasonably satisfied
     that any loan by a Partner will not result in any adverse tax consequences
     to such Partners or the Partnership;

                    (viii)    Any loan must be an arm's length "bridge" or other
     financing on terms customary for financings of that type or otherwise
     reasonably acceptable to the other Partners;

                    (ix) (a) The loan documents for each such Partnership
     Interest Loan shall not include terms or conditions which unreasonably
     (taking into account what is then customary in loan documents for similar
     loans with similar lenders) and adversely impact the Partnership's, the
     Underlying Partnership's, the Partners' or any property manager's ability
     to operate, manage or lease any Property or any Partnership Property; and
     (b) the loan documents for each such loan shall not include terms or
     conditions that grant the lender approval or consent rights with respect to
     the operation, management or leasing of any Property or any Partnership
     Property except, in the case of CLAUSES (a) and


                                        27
<PAGE>

     (b) immediately above, as approved by the other Partners, which 
     approval shall not be unreasonably withheld;

                    (x)  The loan shall not include any participation,
     contingent interest or equity conversion features (provided that the
     foregoing limitations shall not preclude the calculation or payment of any
     prepayment penalty based upon a yield maintenance or similar formula);
     interest on the loan shall be payable on a basis no less frequently than
     monthly (or, in the case of LIBOR loans, at the end of the interest period
     applicable thereto, but not less frequently than every three months);

                    (xi) A Partnership Interest Loan shall not cause a default
     under any agreement to which the Partnership or the Partner incurring or
     guaranteeing such Partnership Interest Loan (the "PLEDGING PARTNER") is a
     party or bound and the Pledging Partner shall have obtained all third party
     consents to such loan required to be obtained by it;

                    (xii)     The loan documents shall provide that the lender
     or lenders (or such representative) will not exercise remedies thereunder
     except after giving written notice to the other Partners and the
     Partnership of any default under the loan documents concurrently with the
     giving of such notice to the defaulting Partner; the Pledging Partner shall
     agree that the loan documents shall not be amended, modified or
     supplemented without the other Partners' prior written consent; and the
     lender or representative shall, at any other Partner's request, enter into
     a separate agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to such other Partner,
     wherein the lender reasonably agrees to provide such other Partner and the
     Partnership with such notice; and

                    (xiii)    Neither the Person making the Partnership Interest
     Loan, nor any Person participating in a Partnership Interest Loan, shall
     have made a loan to the Partnership or to the Underlying Partnership or
     secured by any Partnership Assets or any Underlying Partnership Assets.

               (b)  Within a reasonable time after receipt of a request by the
Partner obtaining a Partnership Interest Loan accompanied by a copy of the
related loan documents, the other Partners shall certify whether the Partnership
Interest Loan and the loan documents relating to such Partnership Interest Loan
comply with the conditions set forth in CLAUSES (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii),
(viii), (ix), (x), (xi) as to the Partnership only, (xii) and (xiii) of this
SECTION 6.3(a), which certification shall not be unreasonably withheld, and any
such lender or representative may conclusively rely on such certification.

               (c)  The Partnership shall notify the lender or representative of
any failure by the Pledging Partner to make any payment to the Partnership or to
any other Partner required under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the lender or lenders under the Partnership Interest
Loan (or such representative) shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
cure such default within 30 days after receipt of such notice by making such
payment (which shall have the same effect as if such payment had been made by
such Partner), 

                                     28
<PAGE>

and until the expiration of such 30 day period, the other Partners shall not 
exercise any of their rights and remedies hereunder or under the Act with 
respect to such default and, if and when such secured party makes the 
payment, such default shall be considered cured and shall cease to exist for 
all purposes of this Agreement and the Act.

               (d)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time
after the date on which the Partnership receives written notice (a "PARTNERSHIP
INTEREST LOAN DEFAULT NOTICE") from a lender or representative that an "event of
default" of the Pledging Partner has occurred and exists under a Partnership
Interest Loan and instructing the Partnership to make all future distributions
or other payments then required to be made to the Pledging Partner under the
Partnership Agreement or any Default Loan to such lender or representative until
further notice from such lender or representative, such payments shall be made
to such lender or representative notwithstanding receipt by the Partnership or
any other Partner of any notice by the Pledging Partner (or any trustee or other
person acting on its behalf) to the contrary.  In addition, at any time after
the date on which the Partnership receives a Partnership Interest Loan Default
Notice and until such notice is rescinded by the lender or representative after
all "events of default" of the Pledging Partner have ceased to exist, the
Partnership shall provide to the lender or representative under the Partnership
Interest Loan copies of all notices and reports being provided hereunder or
under the Act to the Pledging Partner and such other information regarding the
Properties or the Partnership Property and the operations, assets, liabilities
and business of the Partnership as the lender or representative may reasonably
request.

               (e)  Upon any foreclosure of the security interest securing any
Partnership Interest Loan Obligations, or any transfer in lieu thereof, (i) the
secured party, purchaser, transferee or a designee thereof shall have the rights
of an "assignee" of such Partnership Interest under the Act, including, without
limitation, all rights of the Pledging Partner to (A) share in profits and
losses of the Partnership, (B) receive distributions from the Partnership under
ARTICLE 3 or 10 or SECTION 7.3(b), 8.4 or 8.6(b) hereof or the other provisions
of this Agreement or the Act and (C) all other economic rights of such Pledging
Partner with respect to the Partnership Interest (including the right to receive
any and all sale proceeds of the Partnership Interest if and when the
Partnership Interest is sold in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement), and (ii) in all other respects the Pledging Partner shall continue
as a Partner under this Agreement with all other rights hereunder (including,
without limitation, the right to exercise any voting, management or other
consensual rights), unless and until the secured party, purchaser, transferee or
designee is admitted as a substitute Partner pursuant to SECTION 6.4 at such
Person's request.  Upon satisfaction by such secured party, purchaser,
transferee or designee of the conditions set forth in Section 6.4, (i) such
Person shall be admitted as a Partner and (ii) the Pledging Partner shall cease
to be a Partner, in each case without the consent of any other Partner or other
Person being required.  Unless and until such secured party, purchaser,
transferee or designee becomes a Partner under this Agreement, such secured
party, purchaser, transferee or designee shall not be liable for any of the
liabilities and obligations of the Partnership or such Pledging Partner, whether
under this Agreement, the Act or otherwise, except as otherwise provided by law.


                                      29
<PAGE>

               (f)  Any partner or other controlling Person of a Partner shall
be entitled to grant a security interest to a lender or lenders (or
representative) referred to in CLAUSE (vi) of SECTION 6.3(a) under a Partnership
Interest Loan in the direct or indirect ownership interests that such partner or
other Person holds from time to time in such Partner or the Partnership,
provided that such security interest shall not be foreclosed (and no transfer in
lieu thereof shall occur) at any time prior to foreclosure of the security
interest in the Partnership Interest (or transfer in lieu thereof).

               (g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
provisions of this SECTION 6 shall accrue to the benefit of all lenders and
representatives under Partnership Interest Loans.

               (h)  RIGHT OF PURCHASE.  If any lender of a Partnership Interest
Loan or any third party (each a "LOAN DEFAULT TRANSFEREE") should become an
assignee of any Partner's Partnership Interest as a result of a default under
any such Partnership Interest Loan, whether by or through foreclosure of its
security interest in and to such Partnership Interest, assignment-in-lieu
thereof, or otherwise, then a Partner of the other Party shall have a one-time
right to purchase from the Loan Default Transferee such assignee's interest in
the Partnership Interest on the terms and conditions of this SECTION 6.3(h).  No
later than five (5) business days after its acquisition of such assignee's
interest in the Partnership Interest, the Loan Default Transferee shall deliver
written notice (the "LOAN DEFAULT TRANSFER NOTICE") to the other Partners
notifying such other Partners of the transfer, setting forth such Loan Default
Transferee's address for notices and stating the credit bid, purchase price or
other amount paid for the assignee's interest in the Partnership Interest (which
amount may include the discharge of indebtedness in exchange therefor).  The
other Partners may then exercise its rights under this SUBSECTION (h) by
delivering to the Loan Default Transferee, within 30 days after such other
Partner's receipt of the Loan Default Transfer Notice, written notice stating
its intention to purchase such assignee's interest in the Partnership Interest. 
The purchase price for the assignee's interest in the Partnership Interest shall
equal the credit bid, purchase price or other amount paid by such Loan Default
Transferee for such assignee's interest in the Partnership Interest as stated in
the Loan Default Transfer Notice, plus interest thereon from the date that the
Loan Default Transferee acquires title to the assignee's interest in the
Partnership Interest until the date that the sale of the assignee's interest in
the Partnership Interest to the other Partner is consummated at the default rate
stated in the loan documents.  If any other Partner exercises its option to
purchase such assignee's interest in the Partnership Interest hereunder to such
other Partner or its designee, the transfer of the assignee's interest in the
Partnership Interest to the other Partner shall be consummated no later than the
sixtieth (60th) day after the date of such Loan Default Transferee's receipt of
the other Partner's written notice exercising such purchase option.  The other
Partner may designate an Affiliate of such Partner as the purchaser of such
assignee's interest in the Partnership Interest.  Upon the consummation of any
transfer hereunder to such Partner or its designee, the Loan Default Transferee
shall be released from any and all obligations and liability hereunder except
for obligations, liabilities, duties and rights arising before such transfer
which have not been determined or ascertained as of the date of transfer.

          Upon request by a Partner who is obtaining a Partnership Interest Loan
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.3, the Partnership and the
other Partners shall each execute and deliver to the lender or representative
under such Partnership Interest Loan, in addition to the certifications
contemplated by Section 6.3(b), such agreements and other documents as may be
reasonably requested by such lender or representative in connection therewith,
provided such agreements and other documents are consistent with the provisions
of this Article 6.

          6.4  ADMISSION OF TRANSFEREE AS A PARTNER.  No Transferee pursuant to
the provisions of this ARTICLE 6 above shall become a substituted Partner until
all of the following conditions have been satisfied, as applicable:

               (a)  A certified copy of the instrument of transfer shall have
been filed with the Partnership.  The Transferee shall agree in writing for the
benefit of the Partnership to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement and
to assume and perform all obligations and duties of the transferring Partner,
and an executed, duplicate original of said assumption shall be delivered to the
Partnership.

               (b)  The proposed Partner shall have executed and acknowledged
for recordation an amendment to this Agreement and the Statement of Partnership
and such other instruments as the other Partners may reasonably deem necessary
or desirable to effect such admission or substitution.

               (c)  A transfer fee sufficient to cover all expenses in
connection with such assignment and substitution (including reasonable legal and
accounting fees) shall have been paid to the Partnership either by the
Transferee or the transferring Partner.

               (d)  The admission of a Transferee as a substituted Partner and
any release of the transferring Partner shall not be a cause for dissolution of
the Partnership under the Delaware Uniform Partnership Act.  Each Partner hereby
agrees in writing that the Partnership shall continue after such admission.

          6.5  ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS UPON TRANSFERS.  Upon the
occurrence of a Transfer during any Fiscal Year, Profits, Losses, each item
thereof, and all other items attributable to the Partnership Interest so
transferred for such Fiscal Year shall be divided and allocated between the
transferring Partner and the Transferee by taking into account their varying
interests during the Fiscal Year in accordance with Code Section 706(d), using
any conventions permitted by law and selected by the Operating Committee.  All
distributions and allocations on or before the date of a Transfer shall be made
to the transferring Partner, and all distributions and allocations thereafter
shall be made to the Transferee.  The Operating Committee and the Partnership
shall incur no liability for making allocations and distributions in accordance
with the provisions of this SECTION 6.5, whether or not the Operating Committee
or the Partnership has knowledge of any Transfer of ownership of any interest in
the Partnership.

                                       BUY-SELL

          7.1  BUY-SELL OFFERING NOTICE.  Either Party may exercise its rights
under this ARTICLE 7 at any time after a deadlock over a Buy-Sell Major Decision
relating to one (1) of the Underlying Properties or Partnership Properties (the
"SUBJECT PROPERTY") is not resolved within thirty (30) days after the Executive
Committee meeting at which the same is voted upon; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in
the case of an Underlying Property (i) such rights may only be exercised in
connection with an in-kind distribution of such Underlying Property to the
Partnership under Section 5.3 of the Underlying Partnership Agreement, and (ii)
in the event of any such in-kind distribution, the Party whose Affiliate elected
to cause such in-kind distribution shall be required to become the Initiating
Party with respect to such Property hereunder.  At any such time, either Party
(the "INITIATING PARTY") may give written notice (the "OFFERING NOTICE") to the
other Party (the "RESPONDING PARTY") of its intent to purchase all, but not less
than all, of the Subject Property.  The Offering Notice must be given within
fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the thirty (30) day period described
immediately above.  In such event, the provisions set forth in this ARTICLE 7
shall apply.  The Initiating Party shall specify in its Offering Notice the all
cash purchase price ("PURCHASE PRICE") at which the Initiating Party would be
willing to purchase a fifty percent (50%) undivided interest in the Subject
Property free and clear of all debt secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and
other security instruments thereon as of the date the Offering Notice is given
("DATE OF VALUE").  Once given, an Offering Notice may not be revoked or
withdrawn by an Initiating Party without the written consent of the Responding
Party, which consent may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion.  In no
event shall either Party be permitted to give an Offering Notice initiating its
buy-sell rights under this ARTICLE 7 more often than once in any twelve (12)
successive month period.

          7.2  EXERCISE OF BUY-SELL.  Upon receipt of the Offering Notice, the
Responding Party shall then be obligated either:

               (a)  To consent to the sale of a fifty percent (50%) undivided
interest in the Subject Property to the Initiating Party for the Purchase Price;
or

               (b)  To purchase a fifty percent (50%) undivided interest in the
Subject Property for the Purchase Price.

The Responding Party shall notify the Initiating Party of its election within
thirty (30) days after the Date of Value.  Failure to give notice within the
required time period shall be deemed consent to the sale of the Subject Property
to the Initiating Party.  For purposes of this ARTICLE 7, the terms "PURCHASING
PARTY" and "SELLING PARTY" shall mean, respectively, the Party who is obligated
to purchase and the Party who is obligated to sell a fifty percent (50%)
undivided interest in the Subject Property pursuant to either SECTION 7.2(a) or
7.2(b) (regardless of which Party is the Initiating Party and which Party is the
Responding Party).

          7.3  CLOSING.

               (a)  The Parties shall meet and exchange documents and pay
amounts due, and otherwise do all things necessary to conclude the transaction
set forth herein at the closing of such purchase (the "BUY-SELL CLOSING").  The
Buy-Sell Closing shall occur at the office of the Purchasing Party's legal
counsel at 9:00 a.m. on the first Wednesday after the ninetieth (90th) day after
the Date of Value unless the day is a Saturday, Sunday, or national or state
holiday and, in that event, on the next business day.  At the Buy-Sell Closing,
the Partnership shall distribute to each of the Initiating Party and the
Responding Party a fifty percent (50%) undivided fee simple interest in the
Subject Property. Immediately thereafter, the Purchasing Party shall purchase
the interest of the Selling Party in the Subject Property for cash in an amount
equal to the Purchase Price.  At the Buy-Sell Closing, there shall be delivered
to the Purchasing Party a duly executed and acknowledged deed in such form as
may be appropriate and required to legally transfer such fee simple title in and
to the Subject Property to the Purchasing Party, and shall also, upon the
request of the Purchasing Party, concurrently therewith (or at any time and from
time to time thereafter) be executed, acknowledged and delivered such other
documents and records as the Purchasing Party determines are reasonably
necessary or desirable to conclude the Buy-Sell Closing and to otherwise vest
title in and to the Subject Property in the Purchasing Party and allow the
Purchasing Party to develop, use, sell, rent, manage or operate the Subject
Property (including, without limitation, assignments of leases, reciprocal
easement and operating agreements, contracts, personal property and other rights
or property of the Partnership necessary or useful in the management and
operation of the Subject Property).  Additionally, the Selling Party shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver such other documents and records as the
Purchasing Party determines are reasonably necessary or desirable to provide the
Purchasing Party with the same rights and interests in the Subject Property as
were granted to the Selling Party by the Partnership.  The management agreement
for the Subject Property shall be immediately terminated effective as of the day
of the Buy-Sell Closing.  Further, from and after the date of the Buy-Sell
Closing, both the Partnership and the Selling Party shall be released from all
obligations and liabilities accruing in connection with the Subject Property,
and the Purchasing Party shall indemnify and hold the Partnership and the
Selling Party harmless from and against any and all such obligations and
liabilities accruing from and after the Buy-Sell Closing.

               (b)  At the Buy-Sell Closing, each of the Purchasing Party and
the Selling Party shall be responsible for the satisfaction of fifty percent
(50%) of any debt secured by mortgages or deeds of trust against the Subject
Property as of the Value Date and, if applicable, the "release price" necessary
to release any mortgage or deed of trust securing the Existing Financing as of
the Value Date.  It is expressly understood and agreed that (i) the transfer of
a Subject Property shall be reflected on the books and records of the
Partnership and the Underlying Partnership as a partial transfer to the general
partners of the Underlying Partnership, in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests therein, followed by a sale of such partial interest by the
general partner that is an Affiliate of the Selling Party to the Purchasing
Party (or its Assignee), and (ii) such satisfaction may occur through the
assumption of such debt by the Purchasing Party, or the refinancing of such debt
with new indebtedness secured by the Purchasing Party (in each case, with an
appropriate reduction of amounts 


                                     33

<PAGE>

otherwise owed by the Purchasing Party to the Selling Party), or through 
other tax-efficient means agreed upon by the Partners.  It is also expressly 
understood and agreed that the Buy-Sell Closing may be effected through the 
transfer of a duly executed and acknowledged deed directly from the 
Partnership or the Underlying Partnership, as the case may be, to the 
Purchasing Party (or its designee).  The Purchasing Party shall be 
responsible for and pay all costs and expenses incurred in connection with 
the sale of the Subject Property; PROVIDED THAT, each Party shall bear its 
own attorneys' fees and further the Initiating Party shall pay any yield 
maintenance or other interest premium on the pay-off of such debt.

               (c)  The Partners acknowledge and agree that each Subject
Property is extraordinary and unique, and the provisions of this ARTICLE 7 shall
be specifically enforceable.


                                      ARTICLE 8

                              EXIT CALL; PORTFOLIO SALE

          8.1  CALL RIGHTS.  At any time from and after the date which is 
eighteen (18) months after the acquisition of the Underlying Properties by 
the Underlying Partnership, either Party may, without cause and in its sole 
and absolute discretion, elect to call for the Partnership to dissolve and 
the distribution of all Partnership Properties to the Partners in kind; 
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such election may only be made in connection with an 
election, pursuant to Section 10.01(e) of the Underlying Partnership 
Agreement, to liquidate the Underlying Partnership, in which case the Party 
whose Affiliate elected such liquidation shall be the "Exercising Party" 
hereunder.  Such distribution by the Underlying Partnership shall be treated 
as occurring as follows: (i) first, as a distribution to the partners in the 
Underlying Partnership in accordance with their interests therein; and (ii) 
as a distribution by the Partnership of its assets (including its 
proportionate share of the Underlying Partnership Assets) to the Partners in 
accordance with their Partnership Interests.  Any Party may exercise its 
right to call for the dissolution of the Partnership by delivering to the 
other Party written notice stating that it is exercising its call right under 
this ARTICLE 8 (a "CALL NOTICE").  The Party exercising its rights hereunder 
shall be referred to herein as the "EXERCISING PARTY" and the other Party 
shall be referred as the "NON-EXERCISING PARTY".  Once a Call Notice is 
delivered, it cannot be rescinded or withdrawn except with the prior written 
consent of the Non-Exercising Party.

          8.2  PROCEDURES UPON CALL EXERCISE.  Within fifteen (15) business days
after the delivery of a Call Notice requiring the dissolution of the Partnership
by the Exercising Party, the Partners shall meet (a "CALL DISSOLUTION MEETING")
in order to determine and agree upon the fair market value of each Property (for
purposes of this ARTICLE 8, any such property being referred to, individually,
as a "CALL PROPERTY," and collectively, as the "CALL PROPERTIES").  It is
expressly acknowledged and agreed that the Call Dissolution Meeting may occur
over the course of a number of days and may be adjourned from time to time and
reconvened upon the agreement of the Parties.  If the Parties are unable to
agree upon the fair market value of any Call Property within thirty (30) days
after the first day of such Call Dissolution Meeting, the fair market value of
such Call Property shall be determined in accordance with the appraisal process


                                       34
<PAGE>

set forth in SECTION 8.5 below.  Upon the determination of the fair market value
of each Call Property, whether by agreement of the Parties or appraisal, the
Call Properties will be distributed to the Parties as follows:

          (a)  first, the Non-Exercising Party shall select a Call Property for
acquisition;

          (b)  second, the Exercising Party shall select a Call Property for
acquisition; and

          (c)  thereafter, the Non-Exercising Party shall select a Call Property
for acquisition and the Parties shall alternate choices in such manner until all
of the Call Properties have been allocated between the Partners.

If the total number of Call Properties is an odd number, then the 
Non-Exercising Party shall be permitted to elect, in its sole and absolute 
discretion, whether to acquire the final Call Property or to mandate that the 
Exercising Party acquire such final Call Property.  The Call Properties to be 
acquired by the Exercising Party pursuant to this SECTION 8.2 shall be herein 
referred to each as an "EXERCISING PARTY'S PROPERTY" and collectively as the 
"EXERCISING PARTY'S PROPERTIES", and the Call Properties to be acquired by 
the Non-Exercising Party pursuant to this SECTION 8.2 shall be herein 
referred to each as a "NON-EXERCISING PARTY'S PROPERTY" and collectively as 
the "NON-EXERCISING PARTY'S PROPERTIES"

          8.3  CLOSING PROCEDURE.  The Partners shall meet and exchange
documents and pay amounts due, and otherwise do all things necessary to conclude
the transactions set forth in this ARTICLE 8 at the closing (the "CALL
CLOSING").  The Call Closing shall occur at the office of the Exercising Party's
legal counsel at 9:00 a.m. on the first Wednesday after the thirtieth (30th) day
following the day that the selection procedure described in SECTION 8.2 above
shall have been completed (unless such day is a Saturday, Sunday, or national or
state holiday and, in that event, on the next business day).  At the Call
Closing each of the Exercising Party and the Non-Exercising Party shall be
responsible for the satisfaction of any debt secured by mortgages or deeds of
trust against the Exercising Party's Properties and the Non-Exercising Party's
Properties, respectively, as of such date and, if applicable, the "release
price" necessary to release any mortgage or deed of trust securing the Existing
Financing as of such date.  It is expressly understood and agreed that such
satisfaction may occur through the assumption of such debt, or the refinancing
of such debt with new indebtedness, or through other tax-efficient means agreed
upon by the Partners.  Immediately thereafter, the Partnership shall (i) deliver
to the Exercising Party a duly executed and acknowledged deed in such form as
may be appropriate and required to legally transfer fee simple title in and to
each Exercising Party's Property to the Exercising Party, and shall also, upon
the request of the Exercising Party, concurrently therewith (or at any time and
from time to time thereafter) execute, acknowledge and deliver such other
documents and records as the Exercising Party determines are reasonably
necessary or desirable to conclude the Call Closing and to otherwise vest title
in and to the Exercising Party's Properties in the Exercising Party and allow
the Exercising Party to develop, use, sell, rent, manage or operate the
Exercising Party's Properties (including, without limitation, assignments of
leases, reciprocal easement and operating agreements, contracts, personal
property and other rights or property of the Partnership necessary or useful in
the management and operation of the Exercising Partner's 


                                       35
<PAGE>

Properties), and (ii) deliver to the Non-Exercising Party a duly executed and 
acknowledged deed in such form as may be appropriate and required to legally 
transfer fee simple title in and to each Non-Exercising Party's Property to 
the Non-Exercising Party, and shall also, upon the request of the 
Non-Exercising Party, concurrently therewith (or at any time and from time to 
time thereafter) execute, acknowledge and deliver such other documents and 
records as the Non-Exercising Party determines are reasonably necessary or 
desirable to conclude the Call Closing and to otherwise vest title in and to 
the Non-Exercising Party's Properties in the Non-Exercising Party and allow 
the Non-Exercising Party to develop, use, sell, rent, manage or operate the 
Non-Exercising Party's Properties (including, without limitation, assignments 
of leases, reciprocal easement and operating agreements, contracts, personal 
property and other rights or property of the Partnership or the Underlying 
Partnership necessary or useful in the management and operation of the 
Non-Exercising Party's Properties).  The Partnership shall distribute to the 
Exercising Party all of the Exercising Party's Properties, and distribute to 
the Non-Exercising Party all of the Non-Exercising Party's Properties.  In 
the event that the aggregate fair market value of the Exercising Party's 
Properties (less any debt assumed by the Exercising Party) and the aggregate 
fair market value of the Non-Exercising Party's Properties (less any debt 
assumed by the Non-Exercising Party), as determined pursuant to SECTION 8.6 
below, are unequal, the Partnership shall designate one Call Property (the 
"DESIGNATED PROPERTY"), which Designated Property shall be deemed to have 
been distributed to the Exercising and Non-Exercising Parties in that 
proportion necessary to equate, as closely as possible, the fair market 
values of the Call Properties distributed to the Exercising and 
Non-Exercising Parties (less any debt assumed by the Parties). If the 
Designated Property is an Exercising Party Property, then the Exercising 
Party shall pay to the Non-Exercising Party cash, in an amount equal to the 
fair market value of such Designated Property multiplied by the percentage of 
the Designated Property distributed to the Non-Exercising Party.  If the 
Designated Property is a Non-Exercising Party Property, then the 
Non-Exercising Party shall pay to the Exercising Party cash in an amount 
equal to the fair market value of such Designated Property multiplied by the 
percentage of the Designated Property distributed to the Exercising Party.  
The Partnership shall be responsible for and shall pay all costs and expenses 
incurred in connection with the pay-off and satisfaction of all financing 
secured by the Partnership Properties, or any of them (including, without 
limitation, the Existing Financing) and the release of all liens created 
thereby (including, without limitation, all prepayment penalties or fees, 
recording charges and other such costs and expenses).  Except as otherwise 
provided in the immediately preceding sentence and in this sentence below, 
the Exercising Party shall be responsible for and pay all costs and expenses 
incurred in connection with the distribution of the Exercising Party's 
Properties, and the Non-Exercising Party shall be responsible for and pay all 
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the distribution of the 
Non-Exercising Party's Properties; PROVIDED THAT, each Party, the Partnership 
and the Underlying Partnership shall bear its own attorneys' fees in 
connection with such transactions.  Each Party shall also, upon the request 
of the other Party, concurrently with the Call Closing (or at any time and 
from time to time thereafter) execute, acknowledge and deliver such other 
documents and records as such other Party determines are reasonably necessary 
or desirable to conclude the Call Closing.  The management agreements for all 
Call Properties shall be terminated effective as of the day of the Call 
Closing.  Further, from and after the date of the Call Closing, the 
Partnership shall be released from all obligations and liabilities accruing 
to them in connection with the Call Properties, and each Party shall 
indemnify and hold the Underlying Partnership, the Partnership 


                                        36
<PAGE>

and the other Party harmless from and against any and all such obligations 
and liabilities with respect to or relating to the Call Properties 
distributed to such Party accruing from and after the Call Closing.  It is 
also expressly understood and agreed that (i) the transfer of Partnership 
Properties shall be reflected on the books and records of the Partnership and 
the Underlying Partnership so as to take into account, as appropriate, the 
ownership interests of the general partners of the Underlying Partnership, 
and (ii) the Call Closing may be effected through the transfer of a duly 
executed and acknowledged deed directly from the Partnership or the 
Underlying Partnership, as the case may be, to the appropriate Parties (or 
their designees). 

          8.4  WINDING UP; DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS.  Immediately following 
the Call Closing, the Partnership and the Underlying Partnership shall be 
wound up, and all remaining Partnership Properties shall be distributed to 
the Partners, in accordance with the terms and provisions of ARTICLE 10 
hereof.

          8.5  FAIR MARKET VALUE APPRAISAL PROCESS.  If the Parties are 
unable to agree upon the fair market value of any Call Property in accordance 
with and within the time period set forth in SECTION 8.2 above, then the fair 
market value of such Call Property shall be determined in accordance with the 
terms and provisions of this SECTION 8.5.  Within twenty (20) days after the 
conclusion of the Call Dissolution Meeting or the expiration of the thirty 
(30) day period described in SECTION 8.2, whichever occurs first, each Party 
shall appoint an appraiser and, within ten (10) days after their appointment, 
the appraisers so appointed shall appoint a third appraiser.  The appraisers 
so appointed shall proceed to determine the fair market value of the Call 
Property (determined assuming the Call Property was not encumbered by any 
debt).  The fair market value of the Call Property shall be the average of 
the two (2) most proximate appraisals.  If the highest and the lowest of the 
three (3) appraisals are exactly equidistant from the middle appraisal, 
however, the fair market value of the Call Property shall be an amount equal 
to the middle appraisal.  Each appraiser appointed pursuant to this 
SECTION 8.5 shall be a real estate appraiser with at least ten (10) years' 
professional experience and with knowledge of the regional shopping center 
market (or knowledge of any other relevant market with respect to any 
particular Call Property) within the area where the Call Property is located. 
 If either Party fails to appoint an appraiser within such twenty (20) day 
period, the determination of the fair market value of the Call Property shall 
be made by the appraiser chosen by the other Party and such determination 
shall be binding upon the Parties.  If the first two (2) appraisers are 
unable to agree upon the third appraiser within the ten (10) day period 
following their appointment, then they shall notify the then chairman of the 
chapter of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers that is the 
closest to the Call Property geographically and request such person to select 
a third appraiser.  Each Party shall pay the expense of the appraiser that it 
appoints and the Parties shall share the expense of the third appraiser.

          8.6  PORTFOLIO SALE.

               (a)  Any time after the date which is eighteen (18) months after
the date of the acquisition of the Properties by the Underlying Partnership, a
Party (for purposes of this SECTION 8.6, the "PORTFOLIO SELLING PARTY") shall
have the right to cause (i) the Partnership to sell all (but not less than all)
of the Partnership Properties to any unaffiliated third-party Person, 

                                      37 
<PAGE>

subject to compliance with this SECTION 8.6; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such 
right may only be exercised in connection with an election, pursuant to 
Section 10.01(e) of the Underlying Partnership Agreement, to liquidate the 
Underlying Partnership, in which case the Party whose Affiliate elected such 
liquidation shall be the "Portfolio Selling Party" hereunder.  If the 
Portfolio Selling Party desires to sell the Partnership Properties, the 
Portfolio Selling Party shall give the other Party (for purposes of this 
SECTION 8.6, the "REMAINING PARTY") written notice of its desire to do so 
(the "PORTFOLIO OFFER NOTICE"), which Portfolio Offer Notice shall state the 
aggregate price, measured in dollars and payable solely in cash or 
immediately available funds (but which may include a credit for any existing 
mortgage debt to be assumed), at which the Properties as a portfolio, will be 
offered for sale (the "PORTFOLIO OFFER PRICE").  The Remaining Party shall, 
within ninety (90) days after its receipt of the Portfolio Offer Notice, 
notify the Portfolio Selling Party in writing whether or not the Remaining 
Party will purchase the entire Partnership Interest of the Portfolio Selling 
Party in the Partnership for a purchase price equal to the amount that the 
Portfolio Selling Party (and the Affiliate of such Portfolio Selling Party 
that is a general portion of the Underlying Partnership) would receive if all 
of the Properties were sold for cash  (including a credit for any mortgage 
debt to be assumed if included in the Portfolio Offer Notice) at the 
Portfolio Offer Price, and the Partnership were liquidated, on a closing date 
set forth in such notice which shall not be less than ten (10) nor more than 
thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of the Remaining Party's response 
notice.  If the Remaining Party does not respond within the said ninety (90) 
day period, the Remaining Party shall be deemed conclusively to have declined 
to purchase the entire Partnership Interest of the Portfolio Selling Party in 
the Partnership as provided hereinabove and to have consented to the sale of 
the Properties to an unaffiliated third-party Person on the terms hereinafter 
provided.  If the Remaining Party elects to purchase the entire Partnership 
Interest of the Portfolio Selling Party in the Partnership, the Portfolio 
Offer Notice and the Remaining Party's response notice shall constitute a 
binding agreement of purchase and sale between the Portfolio Selling Party 
and the Remaining Party and the Partnership Interest sale transaction shall 
close on the date stated in the Remaining Party's response notice.  At the 
closing, the Parties will each execute and deliver to one another such 
documents as may be necessary and appropriate to consummate the transfer of 
the Selling Party's Partnership Interest (including, without limitation, an 
Assignment of Partnership Interest containing customary indemnity 
provisions), and the Remaining Party shall pay to the Selling Party, in cash, 
the purchase price for such Partnership Interest.  If applicable, all 
management agreements for the Properties and Partnership Property managed by 
any property manager affiliated with the Portfolio Selling Party shall be 
automatically terminated upon the consummation of the sale of such 
Partnership Interest.

          (b)  If the Remaining Party does not elect to purchase the entire
Partnership Interest of the Portfolio Selling Party in the Partnership, the
Portfolio Selling Party shall have the right, subject to this SUBSECTION (b), to
cause the Partnership to sell the Partnership Properties for a cash (with a
credit for mortgage debt to be assumed) purchase price equal to or greater than
ninety-eight percent (98%) of the Portfolio Offer Price; PROVIDED THAT, the
Partnership Properties must be listed with an investment banking firm
experienced in the sales of portfolio properties similar to the Partnership
Properties for the highest and best price recommended by such investment banking
firm, but not in any event less than the Project Offer Price.  The closing of
such portfolio sale shall occur not later than nine (9) months after the earlier
of (x) the expiration 

                                      38
<PAGE>

of the Remaining Party's one hundred twenty (120) day response period 
provided in SUBSECTION (a) above, and (y) the date that the Remaining Party 
delivers written notice to the Selling Party stating that it consents to the 
sale of the Partnership Properties on the terms and conditions of this 
SECTION 8.6.  If the Portfolio Selling Party does not close such sale within 
such nine (9) month period in accordance with the terms hereof, then the 
Partnership Properties may not thereafter be sold as a portfolio under this 
SECTION 8.6 without again giving notice to the Remaining Party pursuant to 
SUBSECTION (a) above.  The Remaining Party shall cooperate with the Portfolio 
Selling Party in order to sell the Partnership Properties on the terms 
provided in this SECTION 8.6.

          8.7  EFFECT OF EXISTING FINANCING.  Notwithstanding anything in 
this Agreement to the contrary, the foregoing provisions of this Article 8 
shall not be effective unless, prior to or contemporaneously with any 
transaction described herein, the Existing Financing has been satisfied in 
full.

                                   ARTICLE 9

                      WITHDRAWALS; ACTIONS FOR PARTITION

          9.1  WAIVER OF PARTITION.  No Partner shall, either directly or 
indirectly, take any action to require partition of any Partnership 
Properties, and notwithstanding any provisions of applicable law to the 
contrary, each Partner hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights it may 
have to maintain any action for partition or to compel any sale with respect 
to its Partnership Interest or with respect to the Partnership's interest in 
the Underlying Partnership, or with respect to any Partnership Properties, 
except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

          9.2  COVENANT NOT TO WITHDRAW OR DISSOLVE.  Each Partner hereby 
covenants and agrees that the Partners have entered into this Agreement based 
on their mutual expectation that all Partners will continue as Partners and 
carry out the duties and obligations undertaken by them hereunder and that, 
except as otherwise expressly required or permitted hereby, each Partner 
hereby covenants and agrees not to (a) take any action to file a certificate 
of dissolution or its equivalent with respect to itself, (b) take any action

                                  ARTICLE 10

             DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION, WINDING-UP AND TERMINATION

         10.1  CAUSES OF DISSOLUTION.  The Partnership shall be dissolved 
upon the first to occur of the following:

               (a)  January 1, 2095;

               (b)  The written agreement of the Partners or by any Party 
upon the exercise of its call right pursuant to ARTICLE 8 of this Agreement;

               (c)  The dissolution, termination, retirement, withdrawal or 
Bankruptcy of a Partner, unless the business of the Partnership is continued 
at the election of other Partners having at least a fifty percent (50%) 
Partnership Interest, made by delivery of written notice to the Partners and 
the Executive Committee given within ninety (90) days of the discovery by 
such other Partners of such dissolution, termination, retirement, withdrawal 
or Bankruptcy;

               (d)  The election of a Non-defaulting Party made at any time 
during the continuation of an Event of Default with respect to the other 
Party;

               (e)  The occurrence of any event that makes it unlawful for 
the business of the Partnership to be carried on;

               (f)  The sale or other disposition of all of the Partnership 
Properties;

               (g)  The decree of the dissolution of the Partnership by a 
court of competent jurisdiction; and

               (h)  The failure of the Underlying Partnership to acquire the 
Properties on or before April 1, 1998, unless such date is extended in 
writing by all Partners.

               To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partners agree 
that no act, thing, occurrence, event or circumstance shall cause or result 
in the dissolution or termination of the Partnership except as provided in 
this SECTION 10.1.

         10.2  WINDING UP AND LIQUIDATION.  Upon the dissolution of the 
Partnership, the Partnership shall immediately commence to wind up its 
affairs, and the Partners or the Liquidator, as the case may be, shall 
proceed with reasonable promptness to liquidate the Partnership Assets.  
Except as provided below, during the period of the winding up of the affairs 
of the Partnership, the rights and obligations of the Partners set forth in 
ARTICLE 5 with respect to the management and operation of the Partnership and 
its business shall continue.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this 
Agreement to the contrary, if any event described in SECTION 10.1(c) shall be 
continuing with respect to a Partner of one Party at the time the Partnership 
is dissolved, a Partner of the other Party (provided no such event is then 
continuing 

                                      40
<PAGE>

with respect to it), shall be entitled to act as the liquidating Partner 
hereunder or to appoint a liquidating trustee (in either event, such Partner 
or trustee being referred to herein as the "LIQUIDATOR") and (i) such 
Liquidator shall be fully empowered to act on behalf of the Partnership and 
to wind up the Partnership's affairs and liquidate the Partnership 
Properties, and (ii) the Liquidator shall be empowered to make, perform and 
implement all Major Decisions hereunder without obtaining the consent, 
approval or waiver of any Partner or Person.  The Liquidator shall be 
entitled to receive reasonable compensation for its services, and shall be 
fully indemnified, defended and held harmless by the Partnership from and 
against all claims, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees 
and costs) arising in the course of it performing its duties hereunder, 
except for any such claims, costs or expenses resulting from the gross 
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Liquidator.  From and after the 
dissolution of the Partnership, the Partnership Assets shall be liquidated 
and reduced to cash or cash equivalents as soon as practicable and the 
resulting Net Cash Flow, and all other Net Cash Flow, shall be applied and 
distributed in the following rank and order:

               (a)  To the payment of creditors of the Partnership (other 
than in respect of Default Loans) in the order of priority as provided by law;

               (b)  To the establishment and maintenance of a reserve of cash 
or other assets of the Partnership to pay contingent liabilities of the 
Partnership (other than any Default Loans) in such amounts as may be 
reasonably and in good faith determined by the Partners or the Liquidator, as 
the case may be; 

               (c)  To repay the principal amount of, and to pay any interest 
owing with respect to, any Default Loan; and

               (d)  To the Partners in accordance with their respective 
Percentage Interests.

          If, immediately prior to the liquidation of the Partnership in 
accordance with the preceding provisions, there shall continue to be 
outstanding any principal or accrued interest on any Default Loan (a "DEFAULT 
LOAN DEFICIENCY"), the Noncontributing Party with respect to such Default 
Loan shall contribute to the Partnership the amount of such Default Loan 
Deficiency, which amount shall immediately thereafter be distributed to the 
Contributing Party in satisfaction of the Default Loan.

         10.3  TIMING REQUIREMENTS; DEEMED DISTRIBUTION AND RE-CONTRIBUTION.  
In the event that the Partnership is "liquidated" within the meaning of 
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) of the Regulations, any and all distributions to 
the Partners pursuant to SECTION 10.2(c) hereof shall be made no later than 
the later to occur of (i) the last day of the taxable year of the Partnership 
in which such liquidation occurs or (ii) ninety (90) days after the date of 
such liquidation.  Subject to the foregoing, a reasonable time shall be 
allowed for the orderly winding up of the business and affairs of the 
Partnership and the liquidation of its assets in order to minimize any losses 
otherwise attendant upon such winding up.  Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this ARTICLE 10 to the contrary, if the Partnership is 
liquidated within the meaning 

                                      41
<PAGE>

of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)(3), but no dissolution event 
described in SUBSECTIONS (a) through (h) of SECTION 10.1 has occurred, the 
Partnership Properties shall not be liquidated, the Partnership's liabilities 
shall not be paid or discharged, and the Partnership's affairs shall not be 
wound up. 

         10.4  SALES RECEIVABLES.  The winding up of the Partnership shall 
not be deemed finally completed until the Partnership shall have received 
cash payments in full with respect to obligations such as notes, installment 
sale contracts and other similar receivables received by the Partnership in 
connection with the sale of Partnership Properties.  The Partners or the 
Liquidator, as the case may be, shall continue to act to enforce all of the 
rights of the Partnership pursuant to any such obligations until paid in full.

         10.5  DOCUMENTATION OF DISSOLUTION AND TERMINATION.  Upon the 
dissolution of the Partnership and the appointment of a Liquidator in 
accordance with SECTION 10.2, the Liquidator shall execute, file and record 
such certificates, instruments and documents as it shall deem necessary or 
appropriate in each state in which the Partnership or its affiliates do 
business.  Upon the completion of the winding-up of the Partnership 
(including the application or distribution of all cash or other assets placed 
in reserve in accordance with SECTION 10.2(b)), the Partnership shall be 
terminated and the Partners or the Liquidator, as the case may be, shall 
execute, file and record such certificates, instruments and documents as it 
shall deem necessary or appropriate in each state in which the Partnership or 
its affiliates do business in order to reflect or effect the termination of 
the Partnership.

                                  ARTICLE 11

                                MISCELLANEOUS

service, by mail, or facsimile transmission.  Any notice or document required

prepaid, certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the Partner 
at its respective address as shown in the records of the Partnership, shall 
be deemed to have been received five (5) days after mailing and provided

         11.3  CONSTRUCTION OF AGREEMENT.  As used herein, the singular shall 
be deemed to include the plural, and the plural shall be deemed to include 
the singular, and all pronouns shall include the masculine, feminine and 
neuter, whenever the context and facts require such construction.  The 
headings, captions, titles and subtitles herein are inserted for convenience 
of reference only and are to be ignored in any construction of the provisions 
hereof.  Except as otherwise indicated, all section and exhibit references in 
this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the sections and exhibits of and 
to this Agreement, and the terms "herein", "hereof", "hereto", "hereunder" 
and similar terms refer to this Agreement generally rather than to the 
particular provision in which such term is used.  Whenever the words 
"including", "include" or "includes" are used in this Agreement, they shall 
be interpreted in a non-exclusive manner as though the words "but [is] not 
limited to" immediately followed the same.  Time is of the essence of this 
Agreement.  The language in all parts of this Agreement shall in all cases be 
construed simply according to the fair meaning thereof and not strictly 
against the party which drafted such language.  Except as otherwise provided 
herein, references in this Agreement to any agreement, articles, by-laws, 
instrument or other document are to such agreement, articles, by-laws, 
instrument or other document as amended, modified or supplemented from time 
to time.

         11.4  SEVERABILITY.  Every provision of this Agreement is intended 
to be severable.  If any term or provision hereof is illegal or invalid for 
any reason whatsoever, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the 
validity or legality of the remainder of this Agreement.

         11.5  INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE.  The Glossary of Defined Terms and 
every exhibit, schedule, and other appendix attached to this Agreement and 
referred to herein is incorporated in this Agreement by reference.

         11.6  FURTHER ASSURANCES.  Each of the Partners shall hereafter 
execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts and 
things as may be required or useful to carry out the intent and purpose of 
this Agreement and as are not inconsistent with the terms hereof.

         11.7  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without 
regard to any conflict of laws rules thereof.

         11.8  COUNTERPART EXECUTION.  This Agreement may be executed in any 
number of counterparts with the same effect as if all of the Partners had 
signed the same document.  All counterparts shall be construed together and 
shall constitute one agreement.

         11.9  LOANS.  Any Partner may, with the approval of the Executive 
Committee or as otherwise provided by this Agreement, lend or advance money 
to the Partnership.  If any Partner shall make any loan or loans to the 
Partnership, the amount of any such loan or advance shall not be treated as a 
contribution to the capital of the Partnership but shall be a debt due from 
the Partnership.  Except as otherwise provided herein, no Partner shall be 
obligated to make any loan or advance to the Partnership.

                                      43
<PAGE>

         11.10 NO THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  This Agreement is intended to create 
enforceable rights between the parties hereto only, and creates no rights in, 
or obligations to, any other Persons whatsoever.  Without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing, as to any third party, a deficit capital account 
of a Partner shall not be deemed to be a liability of such Partner nor an 
asset or property of the Partnership.

         11.11 ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES.  Upon the written request of a Partner, 
the other Partner shall, within fifteen (15) days of its receipt of such 
request, execute and deliver a written statement certifying:  (a) that this 
Agreement is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified, that 
this Agreement is in full force and effect as modified and, stating any and 
all modifications), (b) no Event of Default has occurred with respect to such 
Partner that has not been cured and, to its actual knowledge, no Event of 
Default has occurred with respect to the requesting Partner that has not been 
cured, in each case except as specified in such statement and, (c) that to 
its actual knowledge, no event has occurred which with the passage of time or 
the giving of notice, or both, would ripen into an Event of Default 
hereunder, except as specified in such statement.

         11.12 USURY.  If any return, interest payment, or other charge 
payable under this Agreement shall at any time exceed the maximum amount 
chargeable by applicable law, then the applicable rate of return or interest 
shall be the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

         11.13 BUSINESS DAY.  "BUSINESS DAY" or "BUSINESS DAY" means any 
calendar day except Saturday, Sunday, or a federal or State of Delaware legal 
holiday.

         11.14 PROPOSING AND ADOPTING AMENDMENTS.  Amendments to this 
Agreement may be proposed by any Executive Committee Member by his submitting 
to the Executive Committee a verbatim statement of the proposed amendment, 
and such Executive Committee Member shall include in any such submission a 
recommendation as to the proposed amendment.  A proposed amendment shall be 
adopted and be effective as an amendment hereto upon the approval of the 
Executive Committee and its mutual execution and delivery by the Partners.  
This Agreement may be amended only upon the written agreement of both 
Partners, and no provision benefiting a Partner may be waived, except by a 
written instrument signed by the Partner.  The giving of consent by any 
Partner to any action by another Partner in any one instance shall not limit 
or waive the necessity to obtain such Partner's consent in any future 
instance.

         11.15 PARTNERS NOT AGENTS.  Nothing contained herein shall be 
construed to constitute any Partner the agent of another Partner, except as 
otherwise expressly provided herein, or in any manner to limit the Partners 
in the carrying on of their own respective businesses or activities.

         11.16 ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING; ETC.  This Agreement constitutes the 
entire agreement and understanding among the Partners, and supersedes any 
prior or contemporaneous understandings and/or written or oral agreements 
among them, respecting the subject matter of this Agreement.

                                      44

         11.17 ACTION WITHOUT DISSOLUTION.  To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, each Partner shall be entitled to maintain, on its own behalf or on 
behalf of the Partnership, any action or proceeding against any other Partner 
or the Partnership (including an action for damages, specific performance, or 
injunctive or declaratory relief) for or by reason of the tortious conduct of 
such party or the breach by such party of this Agreement or any other 
agreement entered into with such party in connection with the transactions 
contemplated hereunder, and the bringing of such action or proceeding shall 
not cause or require the dissolution of the Partnership or an accounting of 
the Partnership's assets or affairs.

         11.18 ATTORNEYS' FEES.  In the event of any litigation between 
Partners by reason of a breach hereunder, or to enforce or interpret any 
provision, right or obligation hereunder, the unsuccessful party or parties 
to such litigation covenants and agree to pay the successful party or parties 
all costs and expenses reasonably incurred, including reasonable attorneys' 
fees. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "attorneys' fees" and 
"attorneys' fees and costs" shall mean the fees and expenses of counsel to 
the parties hereto, which may include printing, photostating, duplicating and 
other expenses, air freight charges and fees billed for law clerks, 
paralegals, librarians and others not admitted to the bar but performing 
services under the supervision of any attorney.  Such term shall also include 
all such fees and expenses incurred with respect to appeals and bankruptcy 
proceedings, and whether or not any action or proceeding is brought with 
respect to the matter for which said fees and expenses were incurred.

         11.19 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
each Partner hereby waives trial by jury in any action, proceeding or 
counterclaim brought by a Partner or the Partnership with respect to any 
matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Agreement, 
the relationship of the Partners, any claim of injury or damage relating to 
any of the foregoing, or the enforcement of any remedy under any statute with 
respect thereto.

         11.20 CONFIDENTIALITY.  The terms of this Agreement, any non-public 
details of the transactions contemplated hereby, any financial, marketing or 
other information delivered or produced pursuant to the terms of this 
Agreement not generally disclosed to the public, the trade, or creditors, and 
any non-public information regarding any other Partner or any of its 
Affiliates learned as a result of the partnership relationship created by 
this Agreement, shall not be disclosed by any Partner (or any of its 
Affiliates) to any Person other than its Affiliates, directors, officers, 
trustees, employees, partners, attorneys and agents of such Partner and their 
affiliates, except as may be required by any regulatory authority having 
jurisdiction or by any applicable law, regulation, ordinance or order, and 
except as otherwise required to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

         11.21 PRESS RELEASES.  Each Partner agrees to refrain from 
generating or participating in any publicity statement, press release, or 
other public notice regarding the formation of this Partnership or the 
identification of its Partners, the acquisition, disposition or financing of 
the Properties by the Partnership or any other business or affairs of the 
Partnership.  All publicity statements, press releases or other public 
notices relating to the formation of this Partnership or the identification 
of its Partners, the acquisition, disposition or financing of the Properties 
by the Partnership or any other business or affairs of the Partnership must 
be approved 

                                      45
<PAGE>

by the Executive Committee.  Upon the full execution of the Purchase 
Agreement, the Partners shall issue a joint press release in a form 
acceptable to both Partners.

         11.22 EXISTING FINANCING.  The Partners hereby acknowledge and agree 
that the Underlying Properties shall be acquired by the Underlying 
Partnership subject to, and the Underlying Partnership shall assume, the 
Existing Financing and that the acquisition of the Properties subject to such 
Existing Financing is subject to the approval of the Rating Agencies (Moody's 
Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Investors Service, L.P.).  Each of the 
Partners hereby agrees to execute any commercially reasonable amendment to 
this Agreement reasonably required by such Rating Agencies in connection with 
such approval.

         11.23 CONSENTS; APPROVALS.  Unless otherwise herein provided, in any 
instance in which any Partner, any Executive Committee Member or any 
Operating Committee Member shall be requested to consent to or approve of any 
matter with respect to which such Person's consent or approval is required by 
any of the provisions of this Agreement, such consent (or refusal to consent) 
or approval (or disapproval) shall be given in writing, and such consent or 
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed unless this Agreement 
with respect to a particular consent or approval shall expressly provide that 
the same may be given or refused in the sole judgment or discretion of such 
Partner, Executive Committee Member or Operating Committee Member, as 
applicable.

                               ALLOCATIONS EXHIBIT


     Each Capitalized term used in this Allocations Exhibit either is defined 
in the Glossary of Defined Terms to the Agreement or in Section 5 of this 
Allocations Exhibit.

1.   CAPITAL ACCOUNTS.

     1.1  ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CAPITAL ACCOUNTS.  The Partnership 
shall establish and maintain for each Partner a separate account ("CAPITAL 
ACCOUNT") in accordance with the rules of Regulations Section 
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and this Allocations Exhibit.  The Capital Account of each 
Partner shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions and 
any other contributions made by such Partner to the Partnership pursuant to 
the Agreement, (ii) the amount of Net Income allocated to such Partner 
pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Allocations Exhibit, and (iii) the amount of 
any other items of income or gain specially allocated to such Partner 
pursuant to Section 3 of this Allocations Exhibit.  The Capital Account of 
each Partner shall be decreased by (i) the amount of cash or Gross Asset 
Value (net of any liabilities to which the Partnership Assets distributed are 
subject) of any distributions of cash or property made to such Partner 
pursuant to the Agreement, (ii) the amount of Net Loss allocated to such 
Partner pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Allocations Exhibit, and (iii) the 
amount of any other items of deduction or loss specially allocated to such 
Partner pursuant to Section 3 of this Allocations Exhibit. The initial 
balance of each Partner's Capital Account shall equal the amount of such 
Partner's Capital Contribution to the Partnership on the date hereof as 
described in ARTICLE 2 of the Agreement.  The Capital Accounts of each 
Partner shall be increased or decreased to reflect the revaluation of 
Partnership Assets under Section 1.3 of this Allocations Exhibit.

     1.2  TRANSFEREES.  Generally, a transferee (including any assignee) of a 
Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata portion of the Capital 
Account of the transferor; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the transfer causes a 
termination of the Partnership under Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, the 
Partnership's properties and liabilities shall be deemed, solely for federal 
income tax purposes, to have been contributed to a new Partnership in 
exchange for an interest in the new Partnership, and the terminated 
Partnership distributes interests in the new Partnership to the purchasing 
Partner and the other remaining Partners in proportion to their respective 
Percentage Interests in liquidation of the terminated Partnership.  In such 
event, the Gross Asset Values of the Partnership properties shall be adjusted 
immediately prior to such deemed contribution pursuant to Section 1.3(b) of 
this Allocations Exhibit.  The Capital Accounts of such reconstituted 
Partnership shall be maintained in accordance with the principles of this 
Allocations Exhibit.

     1.3  REVALUATIONS OF PARTNERSHIP ASSETS.

          (a)  Consistent with the provisions of Regulations Section 
     1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), and as provided in this Section 1.3, the Gross 
     Asset Values of all Partnership Assets shall

                                      A-1

<PAGE>

     be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or 
     Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership Assets, as of the times 
     of the adjustments provided in Section 1.3(b) of this Allocations 
     Exhibit, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been 
     recognized on an actual sale of each such property and allocated 
     pursuant to this Allocations Exhibit.

          (b)  Such adjustments shall be made as of the following times: (i) 
     immediately prior to the acquisition of an additional interest in the 
     Partnership, after the date hereof, by any new or existing Partner in 
     exchange for more than a de minimis Capital Contribution; (ii) 
     immediately prior to the distribution by the Partnership to a Partner of 
     more than a de minimis amount of property as consideration for an 
     interest in the Partnership; and (iii) immediately prior to the 
     liquidation of the Partnership within the meaning of Regulations Section 
     1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that adjustments pursuant to 
     clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be made only if the Partners determine 
     that such adjustments are necessary or appropriate to reflect the 
     relative economic interests of the Partners in the Partnership.

          (c)  In accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(e) 
     the Gross Asset Value of Partnership Assets distributed in kind shall be 
     adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized 
     Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as of the time any such 
     asset is distributed.

          (d)  In determining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss for purposes 
     of this Allocations Exhibit, the aggregate cash amount and fair market 
     value of all Partnership Assets (including cash or cash equivalents) 
     shall be determined by the Partners using such reasonable methods of 
     valuation as they may adopt, or in the case of a liquidating 
     distribution pursuant to ARTICLE 10 of the Agreement, be determined and 
     allocated by the Liquidator using such reasonable methods of valuation 
     as it may adopt.  The Partners, or the Liquidator, as the case may be, 
     shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership 
     (in such manner as it determines in its sole and absolute discretion 
     necessary to arrive at a fair market value for individual properties).

     1.4  COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS.  The provisions of this Allocations 
Exhibit relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to 
comply with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), and shall be interpreted and 
applied in a manner consistent with such Regulations.  In the event the 
Partners shall determine that it is prudent to modify the manner in which the 
Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto (including, without 
limitation, debits or credits relating to liabilities which are secured by 
contributed or distributed property or which are assumed by the Partnership, 
or any of the Partners), are computed in order to comply with such 
Regulations, the Partners may make such modification, provided that it is not 
likely to have a material effect on the amounts distributable to any Person 
pursuant to ARTICLE 10 of the Agreement upon the dissolution of the 
Partnership.  The Partners also shall (i) make any adjustments that are 
necessary or appropriate to maintain equality between the Capital Accounts of 
the Partners and the amount of Partnership capital reflected on the 
Partnership's balance sheet, as computed for book purposes, in accordance 
with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(q), and (ii) make any appropriate 

                                       A-2

<PAGE>

modifications in the event unanticipated events might otherwise cause the 
Agreement and this Allocations Exhibit not to comply with Regulations Section 
1.704-(b).

special allocations set forth in Section 3 of this Allocations Exhibit, Net 
Income and Net Loss for any Fiscal Year or other applicable period shall be 
allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage 
Interests.

Exhibit, the following special allocations shall be made in the following 
order:

     3.1  MINIMUM GAIN CHARGEBACK.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of 
this Allocations Exhibit, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum 
Gain during any Fiscal Year, each Partner shall be specially allocated items 
of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent 
years) in an amount equal to such Partner's share of the net decrease in 
Partnership Minimum Gain, as determined under Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). 
 Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to 
the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant 
thereto.  The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with 
Regulations Section 1.704-2(f)(6).  This Section 3.1 is intended to comply 
with the minimum gain chargeback requirements of Regulations Section 
1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

     3.2  PARTNER MINIMUM GAIN CHARGEBACK.  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Allocations Exhibit (except Section 3.1), if there is a net 
decrease in Minimum Gain Attributable to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt during 
any Fiscal Year, each Partner who has a share of the Partnership Minimum Gain 
Attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with 
Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of 
Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent 
years) in an amount equal to such Partner's share of the net decrease in 
Partnership Minimum Gain Attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, 
determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5).  Allocations 
pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the 
respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant thereto. 
 The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with 
Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4).  This Section 3.2 is intended to comply 
with the minimum gain chargeback requirements of Regulations Section 
1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

     3.3  INTEREST ON DEFAULT LOANS.  Interest Deductions with respect to any 
Default Loan shall be allocated to the Noncontributing Partner with respect 
to such Default Loan.

     3.4  PARTNER NONRECOURSE DEDUCTIONS.  Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions 
for any Fiscal Year shall be specially allocated to the Partner who bears the 
economic risk of loss, under Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(1), with respect 
to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such

                                       A-3

<PAGE>

Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with 
Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(2).

     3.5  CODE SECTION 754 ADJUSTMENTS.  To the extent an adjustment to the 
adjusted tax basis of any Partnership Asset pursuant to Section 732, 734 or 
743 of the Code is required, pursuant to Regulations Section 
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital 
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be 
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the 
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of 
gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner 
consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be 
adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Regulations.

     3.6  CURATIVE ALLOCATIONS.  The allocations set forth in Sections 3.1, 
3.2, 3.3 and 3.5 (the "REGULATORY ALLOCATIONS") are intended to comply with 
certain requirements of Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2.  
Notwithstanding any provisions of Sections 2 and 3 to the contrary (other 
than the Regulatory Allocations), the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken 
into account in allocating other items of income, gain, loss and deduction 
among the Partners so that, to the extent possible, the cumulative net amount 
for the allocations of Partnership items under Sections 2 and 3 hereof shall 
be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated had the Regulatory 
Allocations not occurred. This Section 3.8 is intended to minimize to the 
extent possible and to the extent necessary any economic distortions which 
may result from application of the Regulatory Allocations and shall be 
interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.

4.   ALLOCATIONS FOR TAX PURPOSES.

     4.1  GENERALLY.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4, for 
federal income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction (a 
"TAX ITEM") shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its 
correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated among 
the Partners pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 of this Allocations Exhibit. 

     4.2  SECTIONS 1245/1250 RECAPTURE.  If any portion of gain from the sale 
of property is treated as gain which is ordinary income by virtue of the 
application of Code Sections 1245 or 1250 ("AFFECTED GAIN"), then (i) such 
Affected Gain shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportion 
that the depreciation and amortization deductions giving rise to the Affected 
Gain were allocated and (ii) other Tax Items of gain of the same character 
that would have been recognized, but for the application of Code Sections 
1245 and/or 1250, shall be allocated away from those Partners who are 
allocated Affected Gain pursuant to Clause (i) so that, to the extent 
possible, the other Partners are allocated the same amount and type, of 
capital gain that would have been allocated to them had Code Sections 1245 
and/or 1250 not applied.  For purposes hereof, in order to determine the 
proportionate allocations of depreciation and amortization deductions for 
each Fiscal Year or other applicable period, such deductions shall be deemed 
allocated on the same basis as Net Income and Net Loss for such period.

     4.3  TAX ALLOCATIONS:  CODE SECTION 704(c).  In accordance with Code 
Section 704(c) and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, income, gain, loss 
and deduction with respect to any 

                                      A-4

<PAGE>

property contributed to the capital of the Partnership shall, solely for tax 
purposes, be allocated among the Partners so as to take account of any 
variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Partnership for 
federal income tax purposes and its initial Gross Asset Value.  In the event 
the Gross Asset Value of any Partnership asset is adjusted pursuant to 
Section 1.3 of this Allocations Exhibit, subsequent allocations of income, 
gain, loss and deduction with respect to such asset shall take account of any 
variation between the adjusted basis of such asset to the Partnership for 
federal income tax purposes and its Gross Asset Value in the same manner as 
under Code Section 704(c) and the Regulations promulgated thereunder.  
Without limiting the foregoing, the Partners shall allocate income, gain, 
loss and deduction with respect to any property acquired as of the date 
hereof, the adjusted basis of which differs from its Gross Asset Value, among 
the Partners on a property by property basis, subject to the application of 
the "ceiling limitation," in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-3(b).  
The Partners shall allocate income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to 
any property acquired after the date hereof, the adjusted basis of which 
differs from its Gross Asset Value, among the Partners under any method the 
they may elect, so long as such method is set forth in the Regulations 
promulgated under Section 704(c) of the Code on the date such property is 
acquired.

5.   DEFINITIONS.

          "AFFECTED GAIN" is defined in SECTION 4.2.

          "DEPRECIATION" means, for each Fiscal Year, an amount equal to the 
depreciation, amortization, or other cost recovery deduction allowable with 
respect to an asset for such Fiscal Year, except that if the Gross Asset 
Value of an asset differs from its adjusted basis for federal income tax 
purposes at the beginning of such Fiscal Year, Depreciation shall be an 
amount which bears the same ratio to such beginning Gross Asset Value as the 
federal income tax depreciation, amortization or other cost recovery 
deduction for such Fiscal Year bears to such beginning adjusted tax basis; 
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes 
of an asset at the beginning of such Fiscal Year is zero, Depreciation shall 
be determined with reference to such beginning Gross Asset Value using any 
reasonable method selected by the Partners.

          "FISCAL YEAR" means each calendar year, or partial calendar year, 
occurring during the term of the Partnership, or such other Fiscal Year as 
may be adopted by the Executive Committee from time to time.

          "GROSS ASSET VALUE" means, with respect to any asset, the asset's 
adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes, except as follows:

          (i)  the initial Gross Asset Value of any asset contributed by a 
               Partner to a Partnership shall be the gross fair market value 
               of such asset on the date of contribution to the Partnership, 
               as determined by the Partners;

          (ii) the Gross Asset Values of all Partnership Assets shall be 
               adjusted in accordance with Section 1.3 of this Allocations 
               Exhibit; and

<PAGE>

          (iii) the Gross Asset Value of an asset shall be adjusted each 
                Fiscal Year by the Depreciation with respect to such asset 
                taken into account for purposes of computing Net Income and 
                Net Loss for such year.

          "MINIMUM GAIN ATTRIBUTABLE TO PARTNER NONRECOURSE DEBT" shall mean

the Code (for this purpose, all items of income, gain, loss or deduction 
required to be stated separately pursuant to Section 703(a) of the Code shall 
be included in taxable income or loss), with the following adjustments:

          (i)  The computation of all items of income, gain, loss and 
               deduction shall be made without regard to the fact that items 
               described in Sections 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code 
               are not includable in gross income or are neither currently 
               deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes;

          (ii) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable 
               disposition of any Partnership property shall be determined as 
               if the adjusted basis of such property as of such date of 
               disposition were equal in amount to the Partnership's Gross 
               Asset Value with respect to such property as of such date;

         (iii) In lieu of the depreciation, amortization, and other cost 
               recovery deductions taken into account in computing such 
               taxable income or loss, there shall be taken into account 
               Depreciation for such Fiscal Year;

          (iv) In the event the Gross Asset Value of any Partnership property 
               is adjusted to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss 
               with respect to such property pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof, 
               the amount of any such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss 
               shall be taken into account as gain or loss from the 
               disposition of such property; and

          (v)  Any items specially allocated under Article 3 of this 
               Allocations Exhibit shall not be taken into account.
