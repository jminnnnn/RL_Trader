ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
- --------

Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (the Company) operates in three vertically
integrated business segments that include the wholly-owned and joint venture
metals recycling businesses, the Auto Parts Business and the Steel Manufacturing
Business. The wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business and certain joint venture
businesses collect, process and recycle metals by operating one of the largest
metals recycling businesses in the United States. The Auto Parts Business
operates as Pick-N-Pull in the United States and as Pick-Your-Part in Canada,
and the Company believes it is one of the country's leading self-service used
auto parts networks. Additionally, Pick-N-Pull is a supplier of autobodies to
the Metals Recycling Business which processes the autobodies into sellable
recycled metal. The Steel Manufacturing Business purchases recycled metals from
the Metals Recycling Business and use its mini-mill to process the recycled
metals into finished steel products. As a result of the Company's vertically
integrated business, it is able to transform autobodies and other unprocessed
metals into finished steel products. The Company believes that its Metals
Recycling, Steel Manufacturing, and Auto Parts Businesses are cost competitive
in their markets.

The Company's wholly-owned metals recycling business (the Metals Recycling
Business) and its joint ventures have major collection and processing facilities
in the following locations:

            Portland, OR                      Madbury, NH
            Eugene, OR                        Everett, MA
            Sacramento, CA                    Providence, RI
            Oakland, CA                       Long Island, NY
            Fresno, CA                        Jersey City, NJ
                                              Los Angeles, CA

The Company's wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business' eleven yards, including
the major facilities shown above, sold 1.8 million ferrous tons, of which 0.2
million tons were brokered, in fiscal 2004. Approximately 63% of our recycled
ferrous metal volume was sold to Asian steel producers. As a result of the
strategic geographic locations at many of the major deep-water ports in the
United States, the Metals Recycling Business and its joint venture partners
benefit.

Through its joint ventures, the Company participates in the ownership of an
additional 28 metals recycling collection and processing facilities including
the major facilities shown above. These processing joint ventures sold 3.6
million ferrous tons in fiscal 2004. Additionally, one joint venture provides
international and domestic services, which broker metal processed by third
parties. In fiscal 2004, this brokerage business approximated 2.7 million tons.

The Auto Parts Business purchases salvaged vehicles, sells used parts from those
vehicles through its retail stores and wholesale operations, and sells the
remaining portion of the vehicles to metal recyclers. With a network of 23
retail locations in the United States and 3 retail locations in Canada, our
business model has created a competitive position in our markets due to the
consistent approach of offering customers a large selection of cars to obtain
parts and our efficient processing of autobodies. We believe our model can be
efficiently duplicated in other geographic locations and we continue to evaluate
strategic relationships in markets that we believe would provide an economic
benefit to the business.

The Company's Steel Manufacturing Business consists of its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Inc. The Steel Manufacturing Business
produces steel reinforcing bar (rebar), wire rod, merchant bar, coiled rebar and
other specialty products. The Company believes that the Steel Manufacturing
Business has a competitive position in its market due to its readily available
source of recycled metals, efficient production processes, well-located shipping
and transportation facilities, access to competitively priced electric power and
proximity to California and other major western markets.

On May 5, 2004, the Company announced its intention to explore various strategic
alternatives, including the possible sale or merger of its Steel Manufacturing
Business. To date, there has not been any decision made to change the direction
of the Steel Manufacturing Business and it continues to be managed as an ongoing
business segment of the Company.

BUSINESS STRATEGY
- -----------------

The Company's business strategy emphasizes continued growth of the ferrous
recycled metals business and auto parts business through accretive acquisitions,
new store developments and joint ventures, and maintaining its status as an
efficient and competitive producer of both recycled metal and finished steel
products, as well as a low-cost provider of retail and wholesale used auto
parts, through investments in state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment and
increased production efficiencies.

The Company considers itself, first and foremost, a ferrous metals recycling
company with historically over 60% of its operating income, before corporate
expenses and eliminations and impairment and other nonrecurring charges, derived
from the Metals Recycling Business and its Joint Ventures in the metals
recycling business. The Metals Recycling Business is one of the leading
processors in each of the markets in which it operates. The combined operations
of the wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business and joint venture partners make us
the largest United States exporter of scrap metals. The Company intends to
continue its focus on increasing the Company's position as one of the premier
recycled metals processors in the country.

The Company's Metals Recycling Business enters into export sales contracts by
selling forward 45 to 90 days and purchases metals on a daily basis. By knowing
the price for which the processed material will be sold and the costs involved
in processing the metals, the Company is generally able to take advantage of
this differential in timing between purchases and sales and negotiate prices
with suppliers that secure profitable transactions.

GROWTH STRATEGY. The Company has developed a multi-part growth strategy, which
includes the following elements:
     o    EXPAND METALS RECYCLING OPERATIONS. The Company will continue to seek
          expansion opportunities within both its existing markets and elsewhere
          by working to increase its sources of ferrous metals and through
          selective acquisitions or through joint ventures with other metals
          processors and suppliers of metal.
     o    EXPAND AUTO PARTS BUSINESS. In fiscal 2003, the Company acquired our
          partners' interest in the joint venture and formed the Auto Parts
          Business segment. The Auto Parts Business provides the Company with
          strong vertical integration in Northern California. Pick-N-Pull is one
          of the country's leading self-service used auto parts networks. Over
          the last 15 years it has developed a strong management team and
          internal systems that are believed to provide it with the ability to
          efficiently replicate the business model in other locations. In fiscal
          2004, the Auto Parts Business acquired the assets and leased the sites
          for three self-service used auto parts stores in Canada. We intend to
          seek additional expansion opportunities for the Auto Parts Business
          throughout North America.
     o    COMPLETE VALUE CREATING ACQUISITIONS. The Company intends to complete
          acquisitions it believes will create shareholder value and over the
          long-term will earn after tax income in excess of its cost of capital.
          With a strong balance sheet, cash flows and available borrowing
          capacity, the Company believes it is in an attractive position to
          complete an acquisition should one fitting the Company's long-term
          strategic plans become available and if a reasonable price can be
          attained.

INVEST IN STATE-OF-THE-ART PROCESSING AND MANUFACTURING. The Company's objective
is to be an efficient and competitive producer of both recycled metals and
finished steel products in order to maximize the operating margin for both
operations. To meet this objective, the Company has focused on and will continue
to emphasize the cost-effective purchasing and efficient processing of metals.
The Company has made significant investments in state-of-the art equipment to
ensure that its operations have cost effective technology to produce high
quality products and to maximize economies of scale. The Company will continue
to invest in equipment to improve the efficiency and capabilities of its
businesses. During the last five years, the Company spent $65.8 million on
capital improvements in the wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business and Steel
Manufacturing Business. The Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business
continue to invest in state-of-the-art processing equipment and environmental
technology to retain their competitive advantage and grow the business. Capital
spending by these joint ventures in fiscal 2001 through 2004 totaled over $80
million.

The wholly-owned and the Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business
continually review the state of processing equipment and evaluate whether the
current equipment is capable of efficiently processing the required quantities
and grades. Some of our significant planned additions during fiscal 2005
include:
     o    Install a state-of-the-art mega shredder in the Oakland, CA facility,
          which will reduce operating costs and improve product quality as well
          as allow us to shred materials that were not previously shredded;
     o    Replace key pieces of loading equipment, including adding a ship
          loading conveyor system in its Tacoma facility to reduce operating
          costs and increase efficiency;
     o    The Company is developing a reconfiguration and modernization plan for
          the Portland, Oregon facility that will encompass the consideration of
          a new state-of-the-art mega shredder, more efficient nonferrous
          processing and ship loading facilities. Spending will likely take
          place over a period of several years to complete the reconfiguration
          and modernization plan.
     o    The joint ventures will install three state-of-the-art mega shredders,
          a nonferrous sorting system and will complete significant work on
          docks, and storm water processing and collection systems, all aimed at
          improving production efficiency.

In addition, all three of the Metals Recycling Business' export facilities
continue to invest in sorting technologies to recover increased volumes of
high-valued nonferrous metal from the shredding process.

The Steel Manufacturing Business operates an electric arc furnace and two
rolling mills. Management continually reviews operations to identify bottlenecks
in the process and areas where efficiencies can be obtained with an appropriate
cost benefit. Some of our significant planned additions during fiscal 2005
include:
     o    Replace the electric arc furnace in the melt shop to reduce energy
          consumption, reduce conversion costs and improve production capacity
          in addition to increasing the product quality;
     o    Replace the billet craneway to allow for more efficient handling of
          billets into the rolling mills and reheat furnaces.
     o    Repairs to the hotbed on rolling mill #1 will improve product quality.

USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. One of Pick-N-Pull's primary business strategies
is to utilize information systems technology to collect data regarding
production, processing costs and customer sales. To this end, Pick-N-Pull
continues to invest in its core information systems to leverage its competitive
advantage.

CAPTURE BENEFITS OF INTEGRATION. The Company has historically sought to capture
the potential benefits of business integration whenever possible. The Company
believes it enjoys a competitive advantage over non-vertically integrated
mini-mill steel producers as a result of its extensive metals recycling
operation. Beginning with the source of raw materials, the Auto Parts Business
has the capability to supply the Metals Recycling Business with a portion of its
autobodies for use in its metals recycling process. The Metals Recycling
Business then has the capability to provide the Steel Manufacturing Business
with a predictable, high quality supply of recycled metals in an optimal mix of
grades for efficient melting. Likewise, the Steel Manufacturing Business ensures
a steady market for a portion of the Metals Recycling Business' production.

METALS RECYCLING BUSINESS
- -------------------------

The Company is one of the largest metals processors and exporters in the United
States, with eleven wholly-owned metals collection and processing facilities.
The Company purchases, processes and sells ferrous metals to foreign and
domestic steel producers and to the Steel Manufacturing Business. The Metals
Recycling Business also engages in the brokerage business by purchasing
processed metal from other recycled metals processors for shipment to either the
Steel Manufacturing Business or third party customers without further
processing. To a lesser extent, the Company also buys, processes and sells
nonferrous metals to both the domestic and export markets.

Due to the large capital investment required for metals recycling equipment and
the scarcity of potential yard sites that are properly zoned and have access to
waterways, highways and railroads, the recycled metals industry is characterized
by a relatively small number of large dominant metals processors, such as the
Company's Metals Recycling Business and its joint venture operations and many
smaller regional metals processors. The large processors collect raw metals from
a variety of sources, including smaller metal recyclers and dealers, and then
sort, clean and cut it into sizes and grades suitable for use by steel
manufacturers.

The Company's Portland, Oakland and Tacoma metals recycling facilities are
located at deep water terminals operated by the Company and also have rail and
highway access. As a result, the Company believes it is strategically located,
both for collection of unprocessed metals from suppliers and for efficient
distribution of processed recycled metals to western United States and foreign
steel producers.

In addition, we have invested in joint ventures that are engaged in the metals
recycling business. We are a 50% partner in six joint ventures and a 30% partner
in another smaller joint venture. The joint ventures in the metal recycling
business includes 28 metals collection and processing facilities, including
deep-water export terminals located in:

     o    Los Angeles, California;
     o    Everett, Massachusetts;
     o    Portland, Maine;
     o    Providence, Rhode Island;
     o    Jersey City, New Jersey, and
     o    Albany, New York.

In fiscal 2004 and 2003, these joint ventures processed and sold approximately
3.6 million and 3.3 million long tons of ferrous metals, respectively. In fiscal
2004 and 2003, these joint ventures brokered approximately 2.7 million and 1.7
million long tons of ferrous metals, respectively. In addition, these joint
ventures added operating income of $61.6 million and $24.4 million during fiscal
2004 and 2003, respectively.

</TABLE>

The Company sells recycled metals to foreign and unaffiliated domestic steel
producers or their representatives and to the Steel Manufacturing Business. The
Company has developed long-standing relationships with Asian and United States
steel producers. The Company's primary Asian recycled metals customers are
located in China and South Korea, with additional sales to Thailand, India,
Japan and Taiwan. Over the last five years, in excess of 60% of our export sales
have been to China with South Korean companies purchasing approximately 25% of
our total exports. In fiscal 2004, South Korean companies purchased 53% of our
export sales with China purchasing 34%. In addition, new customers in Thailand
and India purchased 10% of our total export sales. The Company has established
representatives in South Korea, China and Japan to better serve these markets.
The Metals Recycling Business' five largest customers accounted for 69% of
recycled metals sales to unaffiliated customers in fiscal 2004. However, the
Company's recycled metals customers vary from year to year due to demand,
competition, relative currency values and other factors. Substantially all
recycled metals sales are denominated in United States dollars and substantially
all ferrous recycled metals shipments to foreign customers are supported by
letters of credit.

Ferrous recycled metals prices are subject to market cycles which are influenced
by many factors including worldwide demand from steel producers and readily
available supplies of ferrous materials that can be processed into sellable
scrap. Market prices for recycled ferrous metals reached historical highs during
fiscal 2004 with the Company's wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business average
selling price for fiscal 2004 reaching $184 per ton compared to $122 per ton in
fiscal 2003 and $94 per ton in fiscal 2002. Prices for both domestic and foreign
recycled metals are generally established through a competitive bidding process
based on prevailing market rates. Foreign recycled metals sales contracts
typically provide for shipment within 45 to 90 days after the price is agreed
to, which, in most cases, includes freight. The Company attempts to respond to
changing export price levels by adjusting its purchase prices at its metals
recycling yards to maintain its operating margin dollars per ton. However, the
Company's ability to fully maintain its operating margin per ton through periods
of rapidly declining prices can be limited by the impact of lower purchase
prices on the volume of recycled metals flowing to the Company from marginal
unprocessed metal suppliers. Accordingly, the Company believes it generally
benefits from rising recycled metals prices, which provide the Company greater
ability to maintain or expand both margins and unprocessed metals flow into its
yards.

The Company also sells recycled nonferrous metals to foreign customers. Demand
from Asian countries, especially China, continues to increase. The Company's
efficiency in recovering nonferrous metals from its shredding process

provides increasing supplies to sell to foreign customers. Also, the Company
purchases nonferrous metals, in smaller quantities, directly from other
suppliers for sale overseas. The nonferrous cargoes are loaded into ocean going
containers which are shipped to the customer. The following table sets forth
information about the amount of nonferrous recycled metals sold by the Company's
wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business during the last five fiscal years:

</TABLE>

SOURCES OF UNPROCESSED METALS. The most common forms of raw metals purchased by
the Company are obsolete machinery and equipment such as automobiles, railroad
cars, railroad tracks, home appliances and demolition metal from buildings and
other obsolete structures. The metals are acquired from suppliers at posted
prices at the Company's eleven metals recycling yards, from Company drop boxes
at a diverse base of suppliers' industrial sites and through negotiated
purchases from railroads and other large suppliers. The Company purchases
unprocessed metals from a large number of suppliers, including railroads,
industrial manufacturers, automobile salvage yards, metals dealers, landfills
and individuals. Metals recycling yards situated nearest to unprocessed metals
sellers and major transportation routes have a competitive advantage because of
the significance of freight charges relative to the value of metals. The
Portland, Tacoma and Oakland yards receive raw metals using major railroad
routes, deep water ports and major highways. Most of our other yards have access
to railways to both receive and then ship metals to our three major yards using
railroad cars, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. The
locations of our facilities allow us to competitively purchase raw metals from
the San Francisco Bay area (one of the largest metropolitan regions in the
country) north up the West Coast to British Columbia and to the east including
Idaho, Montana, Utah and Nevada.

The Company is a 50% partner in two joint ventures operating out of Richmond,
California which are industrial plant demolition contractors. These joint
ventures dismantle industrial plants, perform environmental remediation, resell
any machinery or pieces of steel that are salvaged from the plants in a usable
form and sell other recovered metals, primarily to the Company. The Company
purchased substantially all of the ferrous metals generated by these joint
ventures during fiscal 2004 and 2003, which included 63,000 long tons and 53,000
long tons, respectively. Purchase terms are negotiated at arms-length between
the Company and the other partners to the joint ventures.

METALS RECYCLING. The Company processes raw metal by sorting, shearing,
shredding, torching and processing metal into pieces of a size, density and
purity required by customers for use in their melting furnaces. Smaller, more
homogenous pieces of processed metals have more value because they melt more
easily than larger pieces and more completely fill a steel mill's furnace charge
bucket. Over 70% of the ferrous metals collected by the Company's metals
recycling facilities requires processing before sale.

One of the most efficient ways to process and sort metal is by the use of
shredding systems. The Portland and Oakland facilities each operate a large
shredder capable of processing up to 1,500 tons of metal per day and the Tacoma
facility has a mega shredder capable of shredding over 2,500 tons per day. The
Oakland facility is planning to install a mega-shredder in fiscal 2005, which
will give it the ability to shred 2,500 tons per day as well as more efficiently
process larger and thicker pieces of metal than were previously processed using
other more costly techniques. Mega shredders are designed to provide a denser
product and a more pure form of ferrous metal, which is preferred as the metal
can be more efficiently used by steel mills. Having a larger machine gives the
Company the ability to broaden the types of material that can be fed into the
shredder, and thus processed more efficiently than other more traditional
processes. Shredders reduce automobile bodies, home appliances and other light
gauge sheet metal

into fist-size pieces of shredded recycled metal in seconds. The shredded
material is then carried by conveyor under magnetized drums, which attract the
ferrous recycled metal and separate it from the nonferrous metals and other
residue found in the shredded material, resulting in a relatively pure and clean
shredded steel product. The remaining nonferrous metal and residue then pass
through a process that mechanically separates the nonferrous metals from the
residue. The remaining nonferrous metals are either hand sorted and graded
before being sold or sold unsorted.

DEEP WATER TERMINAL FACILITIES. The Company delivers ferrous and nonferrous
recycled metals to foreign steel producers by ship or container. The Company
achieves cost efficiencies by operating deep water terminal facilities at
Portland, Tacoma and Oakland. The Company owns the Oakland and Tacoma facilities
and leases the Portland location from a related party. Additionally, because the
Company operates the terminal facilities, it is not normally subject to the same
berthing delays often experienced by users of unaffiliated terminals. The
Company's loading costs are believed to be lower than they would be if the
Company was to utilize third party terminal facilities.

During fiscal 2002, the Company's Portland, Oregon metals recycling facility
embarked on a dock and loading facility renovation. The renovation was suspended
in fiscal 2003 when issues with the dock's substructure were detected. Upon
review of new engineering designs focused on operational efficiency and safety
specifications, an impairment charge of $3.5 million was recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2004 to write-off renovation costs incurred prior to the suspension.
The Company is now developing a larger plan to upgrade and modernize its metals
processing facility in Portland which includes the dock and loading facility.
Expenditures related to the modernization would occur over a period of several
years.

Through its Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business, the Company
participates in the ownership of export terminals in Los Angeles, California,
Everett, Massachusetts, Portland, Maine, Providence, Rhode Island, Albany, New
York and Jersey City, New Jersey. The joint ventures deliver by ship recycled
metals to steel producers throughout the world. As a result of owning or leasing
these facilities, the joint ventures are not subject to berthing delays
sometimes experienced by users of unaffiliated terminal facilities.

COMPETITION. The Company competes for both the purchase of metals from suppliers
and the sale of processed recycled metals to finished steel producers.
Competition for metals purchased in the Metals Recycling Business' markets comes
primarily from well financed large recyclers of metal as well as smaller metals
yards and dealers. Many of these recyclers have varying types and sizes of
processing equipment that include fixed and mobile shears and large and small
ferrous metal shredders, all with varying effects on the selling price of
recycled metal. The Company also competes with brokers who buy product on behalf
of domestic and foreign mills. The predominant competitive factors that impact
the Company's recycled metals sales and its ability to obtain unprocessed metals
are price, including shipping costs, availability, and reliability of service
and product quality.

The Company competes with a number of domestic and foreign recycled metals
processors for export sales. Price, including shipping costs, and availability
are the two most important competitive factors, but reliability and quality are
also important.

SEASONALITY. The Company makes a number of large ferrous metals shipments to
foreign steel producers each year. The Company's control over the timing of
shipments is limited by customers' requirements, shipping schedules and other
factors. Variations in the number of shipments from quarter to quarter can
result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues, earnings and inventory
levels.

BACKLOG. On August 31, 2004, the Company's Metals Recycling Business had a
backlog of firm orders of $78.7 million, as compared to $44.9 million on August
31, 2003. The backlog on August 31, 2004 was related to export ferrous metal
shipments.

AUTO PARTS BUSINESS
- -------------------

The Auto Parts Business competes in the auto dismantling and used auto parts
industry. Our stores are self-service stores in which customers remove used auto
parts from a vehicle in our inventory and then pay a standard price for that
part. Unlike more traditional full service stores, we do not remove parts for
customers or perform automotive repairs. The Company believes it has developed
one of the largest networks of self-service used auto parts stores in the United
States with 23 stores in six states and an additional 3 stores in western
Canada. Seventeen of the U.S. stores are located in Northern California, with
the remaining stores located in Nevada, Utah, Illinois, Indiana and Texas. The
Company purchases salvaged vehicles and sells the parts from those vehicles
through its retail store facilities and wholesale operations, and then sells the
remaining portion of the vehicles to metal recyclers, including the Company's
Metals Recycling Business.

The Company is dedicated to supplying low-cost used auto parts to its customers.
In general, management believes that the price of its parts are significantly
lower than full service auto dismantling prices, retail car part store prices
and car dealership prices. Each store offers an extensive selection of vehicles
from which consumers can remove parts. The average store is located on 14 acres
and contains approximately 1,600 cars available to the customer. The Company
carries domestic and foreign cars, vans and light trucks and rotates its
inventory frequently which provides its customers with access to new parts
inventory.

The Company typically seeks to locate its facilities with convenient access to
major streets and major population centers. By operating its stores at locations
that are convenient and visible to the target customer, the stores become the
first stop a customer makes in acquiring their used auto parts. Convenient
locations also make it easier and less expensive for suppliers to deliver
vehicles.

significant components of sales made by the Company's Auto Parts Business and
predecessor companies during the last five fiscal years:

</TABLE>

The Company sells used auto parts from each of its retail locations. Upon
arriving at a store, a customer typically pays an admission charge and signs a
liability waiver before entering the facility. When a customer finds a desired
part on a vehicle, the customer removes it and pays a standard retail price for
the part.

Once the vehicle is removed from the customer area, certain remaining parts that
can be sold wholesale (cores) are removed from the vehicle. In California, these
cores, such as engines, transmissions and alternators, are consolidated at a
central facility. From this facility, the parts are sold, via an auction system,
to a variety of different wholesale buyers. Due to larger volumes generated via
this consolidation process, the Company has been able to obtain increasingly
higher prices for these cores.

                                       10

                        SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
                                    FORM 10-K

After the core removal process is complete, the remaining auto body is crushed
and sold as scrap metal in the wholesale market. The autobodies are sold on a
price per ton basis. This price is subject to fluctuations in the recycled
ferrous metal markets. During fiscal 2004, the Auto Parts Business had sales of
$8.7 million to the Metals Recycling Business, thereby making it the Auto Parts
Business' single largest customer. The Company's wholesale business consists of
its core and scrap sales.

COMPETITION. The Company competes with both full-service and self-service auto
dismantlers as well as larger well-financed retail auto parts businesses for
retail customers. Also, the Company competes for its vehicle inventory with
other dismantlers, used car dealers, auto auctions and metal recyclers. Vehicle
costs can fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions and prices for
recycled metal.

SOURCES OF VEHICLES. The Company obtains vehicles from four primary sources: tow
companies, private parties, auto auctions and charities. The Company employs car
buyers who travel to vendors and bid on vehicles. The Company also has a program
to purchase vehicles from private parties called "Cash for Junk Cars." This
program is advertised in telephone directories and newspapers. Private parties
call a toll free number and receive a quote for their vehicle. The private party
can either deliver the vehicle to one of the retail locations or the Company can
arrange for the vehicle to be picked up.

SEASONALITY. Retail sales and admissions are somewhat seasonal and principally
affected by weather and promotional events. Since the stores are open to the
natural elements, during periods of prolonged wet, cold or extreme heat, the
retail business tends to slow down due to the difficult customer working
conditions. As a result, the Company's first and third fiscal quarters tend to
generate the most retail sales and the second and fourth fiscal quarters are the
slowest in terms of retail sales.

STEEL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS
- ----------------------------

The Steel Manufacturing Business consists of the Company's wholly-owned
subsidiary, Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Inc., located in McMinnville, Oregon
(approximately 45 miles southwest of Portland) and includes two distribution
centers located in Central and Southern California. The Steel Manufacturing
Business produces steel reinforcing bar (rebar), wire rod, merchant bar, coiled
rebar and other specialty products. We believe the Steel Manufacturing Business
has a competitive position in its market due to its readily available source of
recycled metals, efficient production processes, well-located West Coast
shipping and transportation facilities, access to competitively priced electric
power and proximity to California and other major western markets. In addition,
the steel mill has access to major railroad routes which reduce the Steel
Manufacturing Business' delivery costs to major West Coast markets.

PRODUCTS AND MARKETING. The Steel Manufacturing Business produces rebar,
merchant bar, coiled products and specialty products. Sales of these products
during the last five fiscal years were as follows:

Rebar is steel rod used to increase the tensile strength of poured concrete.
Merchant bar consists of round, flat, angle and square steel bars used by
fabricators or manufacturers to produce a wide variety of products, including
gratings, steel floor and roof joists, safety walkways, ornamental furniture,
stair railings and farm equipment. Coiled products consist of wire rod and
coiled rebar. Wire rod is steel wire, delivered in coiled form, and is used by
fabricators to produce a variety of products such as chain link fencing, nails,
wire and stucco netting. Coiled rebar is rebar delivered in coils rather than in
straight lengths, a method preferred by some fabricators as it reduces the waste
and improves yield generated by cutting individual lengths to meet customer
specifications.

The Steel Manufacturing Business sells directly from its mill in McMinnville,
Oregon and from its Company owned distribution center located in El Monte,
California (Los Angeles area) and one third-party distribution center in
Stockton, California. The distribution centers facilitate sales by maintaining a
ready inventory of products close to major customers for just-in-time delivery.
The Steel Manufacturing Business communicates regularly with major customers to
determine their anticipated needs and plans its rolling mill production schedule
accordingly. The Steel Manufacturing Business also produces and inventories a
mix of products forecasted to meet the needs of other customers. Shipments to
customers are made by common carrier, either truck or rail.

During fiscal 2004, the Steel Manufacturing Business sold its steel products to
approximately 350 customers primarily located in the 10 western states. In that
period, approximately 43% of the Steel Manufacturing Business' sales were made
to customers in California. The Steel Manufacturing Business' customers are
principally steel service centers, construction industry subcontractors, steel
fabricators, wire drawers and major farm and wood product suppliers. The Steel
Manufacturing Business' 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of
its revenues during fiscal 2004.

RECYCLED METALS SUPPLY. The Company believes it operates the only mini-mill in
the Western United States which has the ability to obtain its entire recycled
metals requirement from its own affiliated metals recycling operations. There
have at times been regional shortages of recycled metals with some mills being
forced to pay higher prices for recycled metals shipped from other regions or to
temporarily curtail operations. The Company's Metals Recycling Business has the
ability to supply the Steel Manufacturing Business both with recycled metals
that it has processed and with recycled metals that it has purchased from
third-party processors. The Metals Recycling Business is also able to deliver to
the Steel Manufacturing Business an optimal mix of recycled metal grades to
achieve maximum efficiency in its melting operations. Since the Company's Steel
Mill and major metals recycling yards are located on rail routes, the Company
takes advantage of the cost benefit of shipping recycled metal by rail.

ENERGY SUPPLY. Electricity and natural gas represented approximately 6% and 2%,
respectively, of the Steel Manufacturing Business' cost of goods sold in the
year ended August 31, 2004.

The Steel Manufacturing Business purchases electric power from McMinnville Water
& Light (McMinnville), a municipal utility, and is McMinnville's largest
customer. The Steel Manufacturing Business has a five-year contract with
McMinnville that expires September 30, 2006. McMinnville obtains power from the
Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and resells it to the Steel Manufacturing
Business at its cost plus a fixed charge per kilowatt hour and a 3% city
surcharge. The rate McMinnville obtains from BPA is for firm power; therefore,
the Steel Manufacturing Business is not forced to sacrifice the reliability of
its power supply for a lower interruptible power rate as is the case with
certain other mini-mills. On October 1, 2001, the BPA increased its electricity
rates due to increased demand on the West Coast and lower supplies. This
increase was in the form of a Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause (CRAC) added to
BPA's contract with McMinnville. The CRAC is an additional monthly surcharge on
selected power charges to recover costs associated with buying higher priced
power during the West Coast power shortage. The CRAC, which can be adjusted
every six months, has varied from a low of 39% to a high of 50%. The current
rate, which became effective on April 1, 2004, is 47%. Since BPA has been
successful in its cost reduction programs, BPA will pass on a 7.5% reduction in
selected electric power rates effective October 1, 2004. The annual savings are
estimated at over $1.0 million.

The Steel Manufacturing Business purchases natural gas for use in the reheat
furnaces from IGI Resources of Boise, Idaho, pursuant to a contract that
obligates the business to purchase minimum amounts of gas at a fixed rate. This
is a take or pay contract. The current contract expires on October 31, 2005. All
natural gas used by the Steel Manufacturing Business must be transmitted via a
pipeline owned by Northwest Natural Gas Company that also serves local
residential customers of Northwest Natural Gas Company. To protect against
interruptions in gas supply, the Steel Manufacturing Business maintains stand-by
propane gas storage tanks that have the capacity to hold enough gas to operate
one of the rolling mills for at least three days without refilling.

MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND EQUIPMENT. The Steel Manufacturing Business'
melt-shop includes a 108-ton capacity electric-arc furnace, ladle refining
furnace and five-strand continuous billet caster. The melt shop has enhanced
steel chemistry refining capabilities, permitting the mill to produce special
alloy grades of steel not currently produced by other mills on the West Coast.
In December 2004, the Steel Manufacturing Business plans to replace the electric
arc furnace with a 108-ton capacity furnace that will be more energy efficient,
reduce melting time and modestly increase production volume. The melt shop
produced 652,000, 636,000 and 483,000 tons of billets during fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Melt shop production in fiscal 2002 was curtailed due to
sluggish domestic economic conditions.

The Company operates two computerized rolling mills that allow for synchronized
operations of the rolling mills and related equipment. The billets produced in
the melt shop are reheated in two natural gas-fueled furnaces and are then
hot-rolled through one of the two mills to produce finished products. Rolling
mill #1 is a 17-stand mill that was rebuilt in 1986. Rolling mill #2 is an
18-stand mill, which was installed in 1996. In 1997, a rod block and related
equipment for the manufacture of wire and coiled rebar was added to rolling mill
#2. Since then, the Company has completed a wide variety of improvement projects
to both mills designed to increase the operating efficiency of each mill as well
as increase the types of products that can be competitively produced. Management
continues to monitor the market for new products as well as discuss new
requirements our customers have to identify additional opportunities to enhance
the value of our product offerings. In fiscal 2005, the Company plans major
repairs to the hotbed in rolling mill #1. The hotbed cools the hot-rolled steel.
The repairs will improve the yield and quality of products produced.

COMPETITION. The principal competitive factors in the Steel Manufacturing
Business' market are price, product availability, quality and service. The
mill's primary domestic competitors are Nucor, with manufacturing facilities in
Utah and Washington, and Tamco with a facility in California.

In addition to domestic competition, the Steel Manufacturing Business has
historically competed intensely with foreign steel producers principally located
in Asia, Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America in certain of its product
lines, principally in shorter length rebar and in certain wire rod grades. As a
result, in the spring of 2002, the U.S. Government imposed anti-dumping and
countervailing duties against wire rod products from eight foreign countries.
These duties remain in effect today, are periodically reviewed, and do not have
a set expiration date. Recently, imports of steel were also affected by foreign
currency fluctuations. Relevant foreign currencies generally strengthened
relative to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2004 and 2003, making imports into the
U.S. more expensive. Imports were also adversely impacted by rising ocean
freight rates in fiscal 2004. As a result of the duties, changes in foreign
exchange rates and freight rates and generally good market conditions in the
foreign countries, the Company has recently experienced less competition from
foreign steel producers.

SEASONALITY. The Steel Manufacturing Business' revenues can fluctuate
significantly between quarters due to factors such as the seasonal slowdown in
the construction industry, which occurs from the late fall through early spring,
and in other industries it serves. In the past, the Steel Manufacturing Business
has generally experienced its lowest sales during the second quarter of the
fiscal year. The Company expects this pattern to continue in the future.

BACKLOG. The Steel Manufacturing Business generally ships products within days
after the receipt of purchase orders. Backlogs are seasonal and would be larger
in fiscal quarters three and four.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
- ---------------------

Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in
the Company's business. Some of the Company's businesses are subject to local,
state, federal and supranational environmental laws and regulations concerning,
among other matters, solid waste disposal, hazardous waste disposal, air
emissions, water quality and discharge, dredging and employee health.
Environmental legislation and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years
and it is likely that the Company will be subject to even more stringent
environmental standards in the future.

PORTLAND HARBOR
In December 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) named
the Portland Harbor, a 5.5 mile stretch of the Willamette River in Portland,
Oregon, as a Superfund site. The Company's metals recycling and deep water
terminal facility in Portland, Oregon is located adjacent to the Portland
Harbor. Crawford Street Corporation, a Company subsidiary, also owns property
adjacent to the Portland Harbor. The EPA has identified 69 potentially
responsible parties (PRPs), including the Company and Crawford Street
Corporation, which own or operate sites adjacent to the Portland Harbor
Superfund site. The Company leases the metals recycling and deep water terminal
facility from Schnitzer Investment Corp. (SIC), a related party, and is
obligated under its lease with SIC to bear the costs relating to the
investigation and remediation of the property. The precise nature and extent of
any clean-up of the Portland Harbor, the parties to be involved, and the process
to be followed for such a clean-up have not yet been determined. It is unclear
whether or to what extent the Company or Crawford Street Corporation will be
liable for environmental costs or damages associated with the Superfund site. It
is also unclear whether natural resource damage claims or third party
contribution or damages claims will be asserted against the Company. While the
Company and Crawford Street Corporation participated in certain preliminary
Portland Harbor study efforts, they are not parties to the consent order entered
into by the EPA with other PRPs (Lower Willamette Group) for a Remedial
Investigation/Feasibility Study; however the Company could become liable for a
share of the costs of this study at a later stage of the proceedings.

Separately, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has requested
operating history and other information from numerous persons and entities which
own or conduct operations on properties adjacent to or upland from the Portland
Harbor, including the Company and Crawford Street Corporation. The DEQ
investigations at the Company and Crawford Street sites are focused on
controlling any current releases of contaminants into the Willamette River. The
Company has agreed to a voluntary Remedial Investigation/Source Control effort
with the DEQ regarding its Portland, Oregon deep water terminal facility and the
site owned by Crawford Street Corporation. DEQ identified these sites as
potential sources of contaminants that could be released into the Willamette
River. The Company believes that improvements in the operations at these sites,
often referred to as Best Management Practices (BMPs), will be sufficient to
effectively provide source control and avoid the release of contaminants from
these sites, and has proposed to DEQ the implementation of BMPs as the
resolution of this investigation.

While the cost of the investigations associated with these properties and the
cost of employment of source control BMPs are not expected to be material at
August 31, 2004, however $0.3 million has been accrued for studies related to
the pending six mile Portland Working Harbor Willamette River sediment Superfund
site. No estimate is currently possible and none has been made as to the cost of
remediation for the Portland Harbor or the Company's adjacent properties.

MANUFACTURING MANAGEMENT, INC.
In 1994, Manufacturing Management, Inc. (MMI) recorded a reserve for the
estimated cost to cure certain environmental liabilities. This reserve was
carried over to the Company's financial statements when MMI was acquired in
1995, and at August 31, 2004 aggregated $15.1 million.

General Metals of Tacoma (GMT), a subsidiary of MMI, owns and operates a metals
recycling facility located in the State of Washington on the Hylebos Waterway, a
part of Commencement Bay, which is the subject of an ongoing remediation project
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
GMT and more than 60 other parties were named potentially responsible parties
(PRPs) for the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sediment along the

                                       14

                        SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.
                                    FORM 10-K

Hylebos Waterway. On March 25, 2002, EPA issued Unilateral Administrative Orders
(UAOs) to GMT and another party (Other Party) to proceed with Remedial Design
and Remedial Action (RD/RA) for the head of the Hylebos and to two other parties
to proceed with the RD/RA for the balance of the waterway. The issuance of the
UAOs did not require the Company to change its previously recorded estimate of
environmental liabilities for this site. The UOA for the head of the Hylebos
Waterway was converted to a voluntary consent decree in May 2004, pursuant to
which GMT and the Other Party agreed to remediate the head of the Hylebos
Waterway. The consent decree was finalized and entered by the court in September
2004, at which time approximately $7.0 million in settlement funds previously
collected by the EPA from other PRPs became available for reimbursement of
remediation costs incurred by GMT and the Other Party. As of May 31, 2004, the
Company recorded $3.5 million in other current assets representing the Company's
share of the expected EPA reimbursements and, because the expectation of
contributions from other PRPs in this amount had previously been taken into
account as a reduction in the Company's reserve for environmental liabilities,
the Company also recorded a $3.5 million increase in environmental liabilities.

There are two phases to the Clean-up of the Hylebos Waterway. The first phase
was the intertidal and bank remediation, which was conducted in 2003 and early
2004. The second phase is dredging in the Head of Hylebos Waterway, which began
on July 15, 2004. Approximately 117,500 cubic yards of an estimated 310,000
cubic yards total have been removed as of October 30, 2004. Dredging and other
in-water work is scheduled to be completed during fiscal 2005.

GMT and the Other Party may pursue legal actions against other non-settling,
non-performing PRPs to recover additional amounts that may be applied against
the head of the Hylebos remediation costs. Significant uncertainties continue to
exist regarding the total cost to remediate this site as well as the Company's
share of those costs; nevertheless, the Company's estimate of its liabilities
related to this site is based on information currently available.

The Natural Resource Damage Trustees (Trustees) for Commencement Bay have
asserted claims against GMT and other PRPs within the Hylebos Waterway area for
alleged damage to natural resources. In March 2002, the Trustees delivered a
draft settlement proposal to GMT and others in which the Trustees suggested a
methodology for resolving the dispute, but did not indicate any proposed damages
or cost amounts. In June 2002, GMT responded to the Trustees' draft settlement
proposal with various corrections and other comments, as did twenty other
participants. It is unknown at this time whether, or to what extent, GMT will be
liable for natural resource damages. The Company's previously recorded
environmental liabilities include an estimate of the Company's potential
liability for these claims.

The Washington State Department of Ecology named GMT, along with a number of
other parties, as Potentially Liable Parties (PLPs) for a site referred to as
Tacoma Metals. GMT operated on this site under a lease prior to 1982. The
property owner and current operator have taken the lead role in performing a
Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the site. The RI/FS is
now completed and the parties are currently involved in a mediation settlement
process to address cost allocations. The Company's previously recorded
environmental liabilities include an estimate of the Company's potential
liability at this site.

MMI is also a named PRP at two third-party sites at which it allegedly disposed
of transformers. At one site, MMI entered into a settlement under which it paid
$825,000 towards remediation of the site. Remediation of the site has been
completed and it is now subject to a five year monitoring program. The other
site has not yet been subject to significant remedial investigation. MMI has
been named as a PRP at several other sites for which it has agreed to de minimis
settlements. In addition to the matters discussed above, the Company's
environmental reserve includes amounts for potential future cleanup of other
sites at which MMI has conducted business or has allegedly disposed of other
materials.

PROLER
In 1996, prior to the Company's acquisition of Proler International Corp.
(Proler), Proler recorded a liability for the probable costs to remediate its
wholly-owned properties. The Company carried over the aggregate reserve to its
financial statements upon acquiring Proler, and $3.4 million remained
outstanding on August 31, 2004.

As part of the Proler acquisition, the Company became a 50% owner of Hugo
Neu-Proler Company (HNP). HNP has agreed, as part of its 1996 lease renewal with
the Port of Los Angeles (POLA), to conduct a multi-year, phased

remedial clean-up project involving certain environmental conditions on its
metals recycling facility at its Terminal Island site in Los Angeles,
California, which was completed in 2002. HNP is waiting for final certification
from POLA and the regulatory agencies overseeing the cleanup. Remediation
included excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soils, paving and
groundwater monitoring. Other environmentally protective actions included
installation of a stormwater management system and construction of a noise
barrier and perimeter wall around a substantial portion of the facility.

Additionally, other Proler joint venture sites with potential environmental
clean-up issues have been identified. Estimated clean-up costs associated with
these sites have been accrued for by the joint ventures.

METALS RECYCLING BUSINESS
After the shredding of automobile bodies and other obsolete machinery and
appliances and the separation of ferrous and salable nonferrous metals, the
remaining auto shredder residue must be managed. State and federal standards
prescribe sampling protocols requiring representative samples of auto shredder
residue to be analyzed to determine if they are likely to leach heavy metals,
PCBs or other hazardous substances in excess of acceptable levels. Auto shredder
residue from the Company's metals recycling operations in Oakland and Tacoma
undergo an in-line chemical stabilization treatment prior to beneficial use as
an alternative daily landfill cover.

STEEL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS
The Steel Manufacturing Business' electric arc furnace generates dust (EAF
dust), which is classified as a hazardous waste by the EPA because of its zinc
and lead content. The EAF dust is shipped to a firm in the United States that
applies a treatment that allows the EAF dust to be delisted as hazardous so it
can be disposed of as a non-hazardous, solid waste. By maintaining an annual
renewable export license, the Company retains flexibility of having the option
to send the EAF dust to a secondary smelter in Mexico that recycles the EAF dust
into commercial products.

The Steel Manufacturing Business has an operating permit issued under Title V of
the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990, which governs certain air quality
standards. The permit was first issued in 1998 and has since been renewed
through the year 2007. The permit allows the Steel Manufacturing Business to
melt up to 900,000 tons of recycled metals per year and produce finished steel
products totaling 450,000 tons on Rolling mill #1 and 525,000 tons on Rolling
mill #2. As the mill's production grows beyond current levels, the Steel
Manufacturing Business has anticipated that it would need to enhance its
existing facilities to properly control increased emissions in order to remain
in compliance with the Title V operating permit.

AUTO PARTS BUSINESS
In connection with the acquisition of the Auto Parts Business, the Company
conducted an environmental due diligence investigation. Based upon new
information obtained in this investigation, the Auto Parts Business accrued $2.1
million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 for
remediation costs at the Auto Parts Business's store locations. No environmental
proceedings are pending at any of these sites.

On January 6, 2004, the Auto Parts Business was served with a Notice of
Violation (NOV) of the general permit requirements on its diesel powered car
crushers at the Rancho Cordova and Sacramento locations from the Sacramento
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD). The NOV required us to
cease operation of the car crushers at these locations. Since receiving the NOV,
the Sacramento location has converted its diesel powered car crusher to electric
powered, and the Rancho Cordova location has received an interim permit from
SMAQMD to operate its diesel powered car crusher, with modifications, for one
year. We are engaged in an ongoing evaluation of our car crushing systems and
discussions with the SMAQMD to assure compliance and address the potential
regulatory enforcement penalties. We recorded a reserve during 2004 for the
estimated potential exposure for this matter.

It is not possible to predict the total size of all capital expenditures or the
amount of any increases in operating costs or other expenses that may be
incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with environmental
requirements applicable to the Company, its subsidiaries and their operations,
or whether all such cost increases can be passed on to

customers through product price increases. Moreover, environmental legislation
has been enacted, and may in the future be enacted, to create liability for past
actions that were lawful at the time taken but have been found to affect the
environment and to increase public rights of action for environmental conditions
and activities. As is the case with steel producers and recycled metals
processors in general, if damage to persons or the environment has been caused,
or is in the future caused, by the Company's hazardous materials activities or
by hazardous substances now or hereafter located at the Company's facilities,
the Company may be fined and/or held liable for such damage and, in addition,
may be required to remedy the condition. Thus, there can be no assurance that
potential liabilities, expenditures, fines and penalties associated with
environmental laws and regulations will not be imposed on the Company in the
future or that such liabilities, expenditures, fines or penalties will not have
a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company has, in the past, been found not to be in compliance with certain
environmental laws and regulations and has incurred liabilities, expenditures,
fines and penalties associated with such violations. The Company's objective is
to maintain compliance. Efforts are ongoing to be responsive to environmental
regulations.

The Company believes that it is in material compliance with currently applicable
environmental regulations as discussed above and, except as discussed above,
does not anticipate any substantial capital expenditures for new environmental
control facilities during fiscal 2005 or 2006.

ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Until recently, the Company had a practice of paying commissions to the
purchasing managers of customers in connection with export sales of recycled
ferrous metals to the Far East. The Company was recently advised that this
practice may raise questions of possible violations of U.S. and foreign laws,
and the practice was stopped. Thereafter, the Audit Committee was advised and
conducted a preliminary compliance review. On November 18, 2004, on the
recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors authorized the
Audit Committee to engage independent counsel and conduct a thorough,
independent investigation and directed that the existence and the results of the
investigation be voluntarily reported to the U.S. Department of Justice and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and that the Company cooperate fully with
those agencies. The investigation is not expected to affect the Company's
previously reported financial results, including those reported in this 10-K.
The Company cannot predict the results of the investigation or whether the
Company or any of its employees will be subject to any penalties or other
remedial actions following completion of the investigation.

Except as described above under Part I, Item 1 "Business -- Environmental
Matters", the Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings.

ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
            RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW
- --------

The Company operates in three industry segments. The Company's Metals Recycling
Business collects, processes and recycles steel and other metals through its
facilities. The Company's Steel Manufacturing Business operates a mini-mill near
Portland, Oregon, which melts recycled metal, produces finished steel products
and maintains one mill depot in Southern California and one in Central
California. The Company's Auto Parts Business purchases used and wrecked
automobiles and allows retail customers the opportunity of extracting parts for
purchase in its self-service auto parts stores, with 17 located in California,
three in Canada, two in Nevada and one store in each of Texas, Utah, Illinois
and Indiana. Additionally, the Company is a non-controlling partner in joint
ventures that are either in the metals recycling business or are suppliers of
unprocessed metals. These joint ventures in the metals recycling business sell
recycled metals that have been processed at their facilities (Processing) and
also buy and sell third parties' processed metals (Brokering).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
- ------------------------------------------

The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of
operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The
preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and
assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions, and these differences may be material.

The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated
financial statements:

INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using
the average cost method. The production and accounting process utilized by the
Company to record recycled metals inventory quantities relies on significant
estimates. The Company relies upon perpetual inventory records that utilize
estimated recoveries and yields that are based upon historical trends and
periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities. Over time, these
estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced;
however, actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality,
moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal. To assist in validating
the reasonableness of the estimates, the Company not only runs periodic tests,
but also performs monthly physical inventories. Physical inventories may detect
significant variations in volume, but because of variations in product density,
holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product,
physical inventories will not generally detect smaller variations. To mitigate
this risk, the Company adjusts it physical inventories when the volume of a
commodity is low and a physical inventory can more accurately predict the
remaining volume. In addition, the Company establishes inventory reserves to
further mitigate the risk of significant adjustments when determined reasonable.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue when it has a contract or purchase order from a
customer with a fixed price, the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer
and collectibility is reasonably assured. Title for both metals and finished
steel products transfers upon shipment based on either C.I.F. or F.O.B. terms.
For retail sales by the Company's Auto Parts Business, revenues are recognized
when customers pay for salvaged vehicle parts or when wholesale products are
shipped to the customer location.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS
The Company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks.
To manage these risks, the Company employs both its own environmental staff and
outside consultants. These consultants and finance personnel meet regularly to
stay updated on environmental risks. The Company estimates future costs for
known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an
undiscounted basis when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability
and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. The regulatory and government
management of these projects is extremely complex, which is one of the primary
factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future
remediation of potential sites. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can
be reasonably established, and no other amount within the range is better than
another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded in the financial
statements. Adjustments to the liabilities are made when additional information
becomes available that affects the estimated costs to remediate. In a number of
cases, it is possible the Company may receive reimbursement through prior
insurance or from other potentially responsible parties identified in a claim.
In these situations, recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other
parties are recorded as an asset when realization of the claim for recovery is
deemed probable and reasonably estimable.

GOODWILL
In assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future
cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective
assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may
be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded. We have
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets, and are required to assess goodwill for impairment at a
minimum annually, using a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the
fair value of the reporting unit. The first step is a screen for impairment and
the second step measures the amount of any impairment. These tests utilize fair
value amounts that are determined by estimated future cash flows developed by
management.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS
We are required to assess potential impairments of long-lived assets in
accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for Impairment of Long-lived Assets, if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair
value based upon the most recent information available. Estimated fair market
value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows developed
by management. The Company's long-lived assets primarily include property, plant
and equipment used in operations.

TAXES
Deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year-end based on enacted tax laws
and statutory tax rates. Tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax
expense in the year the credit arises. A valuation allowance is established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets, including net operating loss
carryforwards, to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Periodically,
the Company reviews the deferred tax assets to assess whether the valuation
allowances are necessary.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

During fiscal 2004, the Company's operations improved dramatically, resulting in
a record year for revenue and net income. Both the Company's Metals Recycling
Business and Steel Manufacturing Business recognized marked improvements over
last year. As well, the Company's Joint Ventures in the metals recycling
business benefited from rising selling prices to improve their profitability by
148%. In addition, the Auto Parts Business contributed to earnings growth during
the year.

The results of operations of the Company depend in large part upon demand and
prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the Western
United States. In fiscal 2004, strong worldwide demand and a limited supply of
recycled metals drove the Metals Recycling Business' average selling prices to
all time highs. Market prices for recycled ferrous metals fluctuate periodically
and have a significant impact on the results of operations for the wholly-owned
and Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business.

The Steel Manufacturing Business saw significantly higher average selling prices
and slightly higher sales volumes during fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003.
Sales prices and volumes benefited from strong demand for steel products on the
west coast of the United States, improvements in the U.S. economy, and lower
steel imports, which is partially attributed to the weakness of the U.S. dollar
and higher ocean freight rates.

The Auto Parts Business segment was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2003
as the result of an acquisition. It purchases salvaged vehicles, sells parts
from those vehicles through its retail facilities and wholesale operations and
sells the remaining portion of the vehicles to metal recyclers. The retail
operations are somewhat seasonal and principally affected by weather conditions
and promotional events. Since the stores are open to the natural elements,
during periods of prolonged wet, cold or extreme heat, the retail business tends
to slow down due to the difficult customer working conditions. As a result, the
Company's first and third fiscal quarters tend to generate the most retail sales
and the second and fourth fiscal quarters are the slowest in terms of retail
sales. The Auto Parts Business' other primary source of revenue is the sale of
scrap metal and other parts wholesale. Revenues for the wholesale product lines
are principally affected by commodity prices and shipping schedules. As
mentioned earlier in the discussions regarding the Metal

Recycling Business, recycled metal prices have increased dramatically over
fiscal 2003 which positively affected the revenues and profits of the Auto Parts
Business. In addition, the Auto Parts Business completed an acquisition during
fiscal 2004 which added three stores in Canada to the original 23 stores
acquired in fiscal 2003.

FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003
- -----------------------------------

REVENUES. Consolidated revenues increased $191.4 million (39%) to $688.2 million
for fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. Revenues in fiscal 2004 increased for
all Company businesses primarily as a result of increased prices and demand in
the worldwide ferrous metals market, including the addition of new export
customers located outside of China. Significant improvements in demand coupled
with lower steel imports led to increases in selling prices for finished steel
products sold by the Steel Manufacturing Business. The Auto Parts Business
benefited from the increased ferrous metals prices in its sales of autobodies.
In addition, the Auto Parts Business acquired three retail locations in Canada
that added revenue and operating income to the segment.


            METALS RECYCLING BUSINESS
The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $456.3 million, before
intercompany eliminations, which is an increase of $147.7 million (48%). Ferrous
revenues increased $137.8 million (54%) to $393.0 million as a result of higher
average selling prices net of shipping cost (average net selling prices), higher
shipping costs billed to customers and a slight increase in the volume sold. The
average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased $62 per ton, or
51%, to $184 per ton which represents $111.8 million of the revenue increase.
Average export shipping costs increased 57% over the prior year and represent
$19.9 million of the revenue increase. In addition, ferrous sales volumes
increased 1.8% or 33,000 tons which represents $4.1 million of the increase in
ferrous revenue. Export volume is up 1.1% over prior year. Moreover, over 60% of
our total ferrous sales were export shipments to Asia in the last two fiscal
years. In fiscal 2004, ferrous export sales to China decreased to 34% of the
total ferrous exports compared to more than 60% in fiscal 2003. In addition,
ferrous export sales to South Korea increased to approximately 53% of our total
ferrous export sales in fiscal 2004 compared to 28% of ferrous export sales in
fiscal 2003. New customers in Thailand and India purchased 10% of our export
sales volume in fiscal 2004.

Sales volume to the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business increased 15% to
618,000 tons due to increased demand in this finished steel business. Nonferrous
revenues increased $9.2 million (19%) to $57.0 million due primarily to higher
average prices. The average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal 2004 was
$0.48 per pound, an increase of $0.06 per pound from fiscal 2003.

            AUTO PARTS BUSINESS
The Auto Parts Business generated revenue of $81.5 million, before intercompany
eliminations, which is an increase of $16.3 million or 25% from prior year. This
increase is a result of higher wholesale revenues driven by higher average sales
prices for scrapped autobodies due to rising ferrous recycled metal prices and
the March 2004 acquisition of three retail store locations in Canada.

            STEEL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS
The Steel Manufacturing Business' generated revenues of $271.3 million, which is
an increase of $79.4 million or 41% from prior year. Sales prices increased $113
per ton or 39% which represents $70.7 million of the increase and sales volumes
increased 3% which represents $5.9 million of the revenue increase. The increase
in selling prices are a combination of increased demand and passing along
rapidly rising raw materials and energy costs required in the production
process.

COST OF GOODS SOLD. Consolidated cost of goods sold increased $117.2 million or
28% over the prior year. Cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of revenue
from 83% in fiscal 2003 to 77% in fiscal 2004. The reduction in cost of goods
sold as a percentage of revenue is due to profit margin improvements at all of
the Company's business segments, led by the Steel Manufacturing Business.

            METALS RECYCLING BUSINESS
Cost of goods sold for the Metal Recycling Business increased $102.0 million or
40% to $357.9 million. The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues
decreased from 83% in fiscal 2003 to 78% in fiscal 2004. Gross profit increased
by $45.7 million to $98.4 million for the year. The increase in gross profit was
attributable to higher average net selling prices per ton. Compared with fiscal
2003, the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton

increased 37% due primarily to higher purchase costs for unprocessed ferrous
metals and higher export sales shipping costs. Generally, the change in the cost
of unprocessed metal has a strong correlation to changes in the average selling
price; however there is generally a delay in the timing between changes in net
selling prices and the change in the cost of unprocessed metal. Thus, as selling
prices rose compared with last year, so did the cost of unprocessed metal. Since
purchase costs did not increase at the same rate as selling prices, we
experienced significant increases in margins.


            AUTO PARTS BUSINESS
The Auto Parts Business' cost of goods sold increased $10.2 million or 28% over
the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold increased from
55% to 57%. This increase was due to higher car purchase costs and increases in
labor costs. Gross profit increased $6.1 million or 21% over the prior year due
to increased revenue.

            STEEL MANUFACTURING BUSINESS
 Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business increased $51.5 million
or 27% to $242.5 million. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in
fiscal 2004 decreased to 89% from 100% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in cost of
goods sold as a percentage of revenue is attributable to higher average selling
prices, higher sales volumes and the receipt of the final $1.8 million electrode
price fixing settlement, offset by a $1.1 million pension charge. Average cost
of goods sold per ton increased $69 per ton or 24% compared to the prior fiscal
year. As this increase in cost of sales per ton was more than offset by the $114
per ton increase in average net selling price, gross profit improved by $27.9
million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003.

IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER NONRECURRING CHARGES. During fiscal 2002, the Company's
Portland, Oregon metals recycling facility embarked on a dock and loading
facility renovation. The renovation was suspended in fiscal 2003 when issues
with the dock's substructure were detected. Upon review of new engineering
designs focused on operational efficiency and safety specifications, an
impairment charge of $3.5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 to write-off renovation costs incurred prior to the suspension.

In connection with the acquisition of the Auto Parts Business, the Company
conducted an environmental due diligence investigation. Based upon new
information obtained in this investigation, the Joint Venture accrued $2.1
million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 for
remediation costs at the Auto Parts Business's store locations. No environmental
proceedings are pending at any of these sites.

OPERATING INCOME FROM JOINT VENTURES. The Company's joint ventures' revenues and

The Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled
ferrous and nonferrous metals. The increase in revenues recognized by these
joint ventures is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices and
higher volumes. Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures were
3.6 million tons for the year ended

August 31, 2004 compared with 3.3 million tons in the prior year. The volume of
ferrous metal brokered by the joint ventures increased to 2.7 million tons in
fiscal 2004 compared to 1.7 million tons in the prior year, which came primarily
from increased market share in Mexico and Latin America coupled with product
line expansion into other scrap metal related commodities. The average net
selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to $187 per
ton from $118 per ton, due to the same worldwide supply and demand factors
affecting the wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business.

In fiscal 2004, the Company's share of income from Joint Ventures in the metals
recycling business increased to $61.7 million due to higher average net selling
prices, increased margins and more efficient operations, benefiting from similar
market factors and pricing as described in the discussion above relating to the
Company's wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business. The Company's joint ventures
with Hugo Neu Corporation earned nearly all of this operating income. The
Company's share of operating income from the global brokering joint venture
increased from $2.3 million in fiscal 2003 to $11.3 million in fiscal 2004. The
Company's share of joint venture operating income in fiscal 2004 also included
an estimated $3.4 million from a joint venture contract with New York City for
the processing and disposal of curbside recycling materials that commenced in
April 2004. The contract with New York City is an interim contract, and the
Company's present intention is not to participate in the anticipated long-tem
contract, so the income stream from this contract could end at any time.
Operating income in fiscal 2004 was reduced by $6.1 million representing the
Company's share of the joint venture LIFO inventory adjustment compared with a
reduction of $2.2 million in fiscal 2003.

SELLING EXPENSES. Selling expenses increased $0.8 million over fiscal 2003
primarily due to increased advertising expenses in the Auto Parts Business.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and Administrative expenses
increased $11.0 million over fiscal 2003. The higher general and administrative
expenses were due to higher bonus expense as well as increased spending on
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and professional fees. The Company's bonus plan is
based upon the principles of Economic Value Added (EVA) and is directly tied to
the financial performance of the Company. Given the Company's recent record
financial performance, bonus expense is significantly higher in fiscal 2004.

INTEREST EXPENSE. In fiscal 2004, interest expense increased $0.3 million
compared to fiscal 2003 due to higher average debt balances during fiscal 2004.

INCOME TAX PROVISION. The 31% tax rate for fiscal 2004 compares with a tax rate
of 27% for fiscal 2003. The increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to a
reduction in estimated Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI) tax benefits on
export sales, an increase partially offset by the reversal of the $6.1 million
deferred tax valuation allowance associated with Net Operating Loss and minimum
tax credit carryforwards. The Company's tax rate is expected to increase in
fiscal 2005 due to a change in the tax law phasing out ETI tax benefits over the
next two years and the deferred tax valuation allowance being fully reversed.

FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002
- -----------------------------------

REVENUES. Consolidated revenues increased $146.2 million (42%) to $496.9 million
for fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. Revenues for the Metals Recycling
Business increased due to higher selling prices and volumes as worldwide demand
for ferrous metals strengthened through the year. Revenues for the Steel
Manufacturing Business also increased due to higher average net selling prices
and increased sales volumes. Consolidated revenues also increased by $65.2
million due to the addition of the Auto Parts Business as a consolidated
business.

The Metals Recycling Business generated revenues of $308.6 million, before
intercompany eliminations, which is an increase of $86.7 million (39%). Ferrous
revenues increased $81.8 million (47%) to $255.3 million as a result of an
increase in tons sold and higher average selling prices net of shipping cost
(average net selling prices). Ferrous sales volumes increased 255,000 tons (16%)
and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased $28 (30%)
to $122 per ton. Curtailed supplies of ferrous recycled metals from the
countries of the former Soviet Union, growing worldwide demand and the weakness
of the U.S. dollar drove the volume and price increases. In fiscal 2003, the
Metals Recycling Business made export shipments aggregating 1.2 million tons, an
increase of 89,000 tons (8%) compared with fiscal 2002. Domestic third-party
ferrous tonnage also increased by 38,000 tons (46%) to 120,000 tons. Sales to
the Company's Steel Manufacturing Business increased 31% to 535,000 tons due to
increased demand in this business. Nonferrous revenues increased $6.1 million
(15%) to $47.8 million due primarily to higher average prices. The average net
nonferrous selling price in fiscal 2003 was $0.42 per pound, an increase of
$0.06 per pound from fiscal 2002.

The Steel Manufacturing Business' revenues increased $25.3 million (15%) from
revenues recognized in the prior year to $191.9 million in fiscal 2003 primarily
due to higher average net selling prices and higher volumes for all major
product lines. The volume of finished steel products sold increased, along with
the average net selling price per ton, compared with fiscal 2002. Sales of
finished steel products were up 9% to 622,000 tons while the average net selling
price per ton increased $15 per ton (5%) to $291 per ton. The increase in the
average sales price per ton was primarily due to a higher valued product sales
mix and lower supplies of competing importing steel, which was partially
attributed to the weakness of the U.S. dollar. Also, towards the end of the
fiscal 2003 second quarter, the Company and other steel producers increased
their selling prices for rebar and coiled rebar. Additionally, merchant bar
selling prices have increased modestly to adjust to the costs of production. The
increase in sales volume was due to a 30% increase in the volume of wire rod and
a 6% increase in sales volume of rebar. The higher wire rod volume was due to
import duties imposed by the U.S. Government in the spring of 2002 on certain
wire rod products. The increase in rebar volumes is primarily due to increased
demand as wholesale customers bought inventory ahead of the effective date of
announced price increases.

As previously mentioned, the Auto Parts Business was acquired on February 14,
2003 and was considered a "step" acquisition allowing the consolidation of its
financial results as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. As such, revenues for
fiscal 2003 included $65.2 million related to the Auto Parts Business with no
comparable revenues being recognized for financial statement purposes in fiscal
2002. In order to aid the reader's understanding of the financial performance of
this segment, the pro forma fiscal 2002 revenues for the Auto Parts Business
were $58.3 million. The $6.9 million (12%) increase was primarily caused by an
increase in wholesale revenues driven by higher average sales prices for
scrapped autobodies due to rising ferrous recycled metal prices. Wholesale
prices also benefited from the implementation of a new "core" distribution
center that aggregated production volumes and provided an improved venue to sell
these products to competing customers. Retail revenues were also up due to
growth in part sales and admissions pricing.

COST OF GOODS SOLD. Consolidated cost of goods sold increased $88.6 million
(27%) to $413.0 million and was 83% percent of revenues compared with 93% in
fiscal 2002. The decrease to 83% was primarily due to improved margins, coming
principally from higher selling prices, for all of the Company's business
segments.

Cost of goods sold for the Metals Recycling Business increased $56.0 million
(28%) to $255.9 million before intercompany eliminations. The cost of goods sold
as a percentage of revenues decreased from 90% for fiscal 2002 to 83% during
fiscal 2003, contributing to a $30.7 million increase in gross profit. This
increase in gross margin in fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to higher
selling prices and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher prices paid
to suppliers of ferrous recycled metals and higher export freight rates,
resulting in an $18 per ton (18%) increase in the average ferrous metals cost of
sales per ton. Cost of sales per ferrous ton increased as higher selling prices
and higher demand for processed metal pushed up the purchase price the Company
paid for unprocessed metal. Competition from other recyclers for the purchase of
unprocessed metal was also a factor in the cost increases. The average export
freight rate climbed $4 per ton in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002.

Cost of goods sold for the Steel Manufacturing Business increased $21.8 million
(13%) to $191.0 million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 102% in
fiscal 2002 to 100% in fiscal 2003. The decrease was due to a higher average
sales price per ton and lowered fixed cost per ton, due to larger production
volumes spreading the fixed costs over more tons produced, partially offset by
higher prices paid for scrap metal. Melt shop production increased 32% and
rolling mill production increased 16% compared with fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002
production volumes were temporarily curtailed in order to reduce inventory to
better match it with customer demand. Average cost of sales per ton increased
$10 per ton (3%) compared with the prior fiscal year. As this increase in cost
of sales per ton was more than offset by the $15 per ton increase in average net
selling price, gross profit improved by $3.5 million (135%) in fiscal 2003
compared with fiscal 2002.

The Auto Parts Business' cost of sales was $0.5 million (1%) lower during fiscal
2003 as compared to the pro forma cost of sales for fiscal 2002. As a percentage
of revenues, cost of sales decreased from 63% to 55%. This improvement was due
to higher margins realized on wholesale sales partially offset by higher labor
costs.

IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER NONRECURRING CHARGES. In connection with the acquisition of
the Auto Parts Business, the Company conducted an environmental due diligence
investigation. Based upon new information obtained in this investigation, the
Joint Venture accrued $2.1 million in environmental liabilities in the second
quarter of fiscal 2003 for remediation costs at the Auto Parts Business's store
locations. No environmental proceedings are pending at any of these sites.

The Company recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges of $7.1 million
in fiscal 2002. The Company recorded nonrecurring charges of $1.9 million for
the early termination of a fixed-price Alaska barge contract of affreightment
that management determined was not cost effective. The Alaska barge contract
charge included a $0.9 million write-off of a note receivable and a $1.0 million
payment to terminate the contract. Also, an impairment charge of $1.8 million
was recorded for the elimination of an unprofitable car-crushing business and an
impairment charge of $1.1 million was recorded for the closure of an
under-performing yard in Reno, Nevada. Nonrecurring charges of $1.5 million were
recorded for the loss on the early termination of two vessel charter contracts
with a related company. The Company terminated the leases in order to take
advantage of market rates which were $7 to $8 per ton lower than the all-in
contracted rates. Shipping cost savings as a result of the contract termination
totaled approximately $2.0 million. Additionally, a loss of $0.8 million was
recorded for the sale of a non-strategic steel forging business.

The Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled
ferrous and nonferrous metals. The increase in revenues recognized by these
joint ventures is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices.
Shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures were 3.3 million tons
for the year ended August 31, 2003 compared with 3.5 million tons in the prior
year. The volume of ferrous metal brokered by the joint ventures increased to
1.7 million tons in fiscal 2003 compared to 1.2 million tons in the prior year.
The average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that
period to $118 per ton from $90 per ton, predominantly due to strong demand from
Asia, especially China and Korea. These joint ventures also increased their
sales margins by improving operational efficiencies.

In fiscal 2003, the Company's share of income from Joint Ventures in the metals
recycling business increased to $24.8 million due to higher average net selling
prices, increased margins and more efficient operations. The Company's joint
ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation, which earned the majority of the income,
instituted EVA concurrently with the Company in fiscal 2001. The use of EVA
coupled with management changes has continued to result in improved operational
efficiencies and increased profitability. Operating income in fiscal 2003 was
reduced by $2.2 million representing the Company's share of the JV LIFO
inventory adjustment compared with a reduction of $1.2 million in fiscal 2002.

Revenues of the Joint Venture suppliers of metals decreased by $52.9 million
from fiscal 2002 as compared to the fiscal 2003. Most of this decrease was
caused by the reclassification in fiscal 2003 of the Pick-N-Pull Joint Venture,
which is now consolidated and included as a new business segment, the Auto Parts
Business. Excluding the change caused by this reclassification, revenues
decreased $7.0 million during fiscal 2003 compared to last year due to lower
selling prices and lower demolition revenue. The Company's equity in income from
these Joint Ventures, excluding the impact of Pick-N-Pull, decreased $1.1
million primarily due to the slowdown in the U.S. economy.

SELLING EXPENSES. These expenses increased $2.4 million compared with fiscal
2002 primarily due to an increase in export commission expense caused from
higher ferrous recycled metals export sales.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Compared with fiscal 2002, general and
administrative expenses increased $6.2 million. The consolidation of the Auto
Parts Business represents $5.0 million of this increase. The remainder of this
increase is primarily due to increased bonus accruals directly related to the
improvement in the Company's EVA performance.

INTEREST EXPENSE. In fiscal 2003, interest expense decreased $0.5 million
compared with fiscal 2002 due to lower average interest rates and borrowings.
The Company's borrowings averaged $70.5 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $75.9
million in fiscal 2002. The average interest rate for fiscal 2003 was 2.1%
compared with 2.7% for fiscal 2002.

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES. Other income and expenses decreased $0.7 million in
fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. The difference is principally due to the
addition of the Auto Parts Business and a harbor maintenance tax refund received
in fiscal 2002. In addition, this line item includes market value adjustments
for changes in investment performance for securities held in a trust for the
purpose of funding future non-qualified pension payments. The Company recognized
gains from the trust fund assets in the amount of $0.4 million in fiscal 2003
and losses of $0.4 million in fiscal 2002.

INCOME TAX PROVISION. The Company's effective rate of 27% for fiscal 2003 was
lower than the 35% federal statutory tax rate for three primary reasons: (1) the
implementation of SFAS 142 eliminated the amortization of goodwill, some of
which had been nondeductible; (2) export sales, which under Federal law are
taxed at a lower rate than domestic sales increased; and (3) net operating loss
carryforwards that accompanied an earlier acquisition continued to provide
benefit. The fiscal 2002 tax rate of 14% benefited from the two latter items, as
well as from the one-time recognition of California tax credits that had been
generated over the previous ten years.

As part of the 1996 acquisition of Proler International Corp. (Proler), the
Company acquired $31.4 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards
(NOLs). The Company recognized no immediate tax benefit for the NOLs. Instead,
the Company set up an offsetting $31.4 million valuation allowance because the
ultimate use of the NOLs was uncertain given the then-current federal tax law
proscription against applying the NOLs to any taxable income other than the
post-acquisition income generated by Proler. A change to federal tax law in
1999, however, allowed an annual $2.4 million of NOL to be applied to taxable
income from all sources, not just from Proler. Due to this change in tax law,
the Company released an annual $2.4 million from the valuation allowance, and
recognized the corresponding $0.8 million in tax benefit, in fiscal years 2003
and 2002. This is a major reason why the Company's effective tax rates were
lower than the statutory rates for those years.

The Company also acquired $0.7 million of credits as part of the Proler
acquisition. As with the NOLs, a valuation allowance was set up to offset the
credits. No part of the valuation allowance had been released as of August 31,
2003. The credits are not likely to be used until after the NOLs have been used
or expire. The credits can be carried forward indefinitely.

In fiscal 2002, the Company qualified for $2.1 million of Enterprise Zone tax
credits in the state of California. These credits can be used to offset
California state income taxes to the extent that the Company has a California
franchise (income) tax liability on taxable income apportionable to each zone.
Any credits in excess of the tax liability can be carried forward indefinitely.

fiscal 2002 was well below the statutory rate of 35%.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.
- --------------------------------
For fiscal 2004, cash generated from operations was $73.2 million, compared to
$40.9 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in cash flow from operations was
primary related to an improvement in net income, offset by the reinvestment of
cash flow by the Hugo Neu joint ventures and an increase in inventories, which
is a result of higher inventory quantities on hand at August 31, 2004 and
increased inventory costs for raw materials at all divisions.

Capital expenditures totaled $22.2 million, $21.8 million, and $9.6 million for
fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The capital expenditures in
fiscal 2004 included production improvement projects, including partial payments
on the new state-of-the-art mega shredder at the Company's Oakland, California
recycling facility and the major furnace replacement at our Steel Manufacturing
Business.

In March 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of three self-service used
auto parts stores in Canada for a purchase price of $13.7 million. During fiscal
2004, the Company also made additional post-closing payments of $11.8 million
related to the acquisition of Pick and Pull Auto Dismantling, Inc., which closed
in February 2003.

As a result of acquisitions completed in prior years, the Company had $21.5
million of environment liabilities as of August 31, 2004. Over the next 12
months, the Company expects to pay approximately $9.3 million relating to a
previously accrued remediation projects in connection with one of its metals
recycling facilities located in the State of Washington on the Hylebos Waterway.
Additionally, the Company expects to require significant future cash outlays as
it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of other such
environmental liabilities.

As of August 31, 2004, the Company had a committed unsecured bank credit
facility totaling $150 million that matures in May 2006. The credit facility
contains a provision whereby the Company may, upon obtaining consent of the bank
group, extend the term of the agreement by one year to May 2007. The Company has
provided notice of its intention to request such an extension and the bank group
has agreed to the request. The extension is subject to the Company providing
standard representations and warranties as of the May 2006 original maturity
date. The Company currently anticipates it will be able to provide the required
representations and warranties and the agreement will be extended. The Company
also has additional unsecured credit lines totaling $20 million, which are
uncommitted. The Company's debt agreements have certain restrictive covenants.
As of August 31, 2004, the Company had aggregate bank borrowings outstanding
under these facilities of $60.0 million and was in compliance with such
covenants.

In July 2002, the Company's metals recycling joint ventures with Hugo Neu
Corporation entered into a revolving credit facility (JV Credit Facility) with a
group of banks for working capital and general corporate purposes. Prior to that
time, the joint ventures' working capital and other cash needs had been met by
advances provided equally by the Company and its partner, Hugo Neu Corporation.
During February 2004, the facility was increased to $110 million. The JV Credit
Facility expires on January 26, 2005 and is secured by the inventory and
receivables of the joint venture businesses. The Company is not a guarantor of
the JV Credit Facility. The JV Credit Facility has a number of covenants and
restrictions, including restrictions on the level of distributions to the joint
venture partners. As of August 31, 2004, there was no debt outstanding under the
credit facility and the joint ventures were in compliance with these covenants.
It is the Company's present intention to not renew the facility upon its
expiration, in which case the Company and its partner will need to revert to
funding the cash needs of the joint ventures on an equal basis.

The joint venture agreements allow for distributions to the joint venture
partners. During the two year period ended August 31, 2004, the Company recorded
$86.0 million in operating income representing its share in the earnings of the
joint ventures. However, during this time the Company received no cash
distributions. Instead, the Hugo-Neu joint ventures have been utilizing all of
their available cash flow to fund expansion of working capital, business growth,
and investment in state-of-the-art equipment to improve the efficiencies and
capabilities of their business and to pay down borrowings from the JV Credit
Facility.

The joint ventures in the metals recycling business are purchasing and
installing three new mega-shredders in fiscal 2005 for an estimated cost of $36
million. The joint venture partners anticipate using a long-term equipment
financing facility to support the purchase. The joint ventures would make
principal and interest payments on the financing facility from operating income.

The Company has certain contractual obligations to make future payments. The
following table summarizes these future obligations as of August 31, 2004 (in

Pursuant to a stock repurchase program which began in 1997, the Company is
authorized to repurchase up to 3.0 million shares of its stock when management
believes such repurchases would enhance shareholder value. During fiscal year
2004, the Company made no share repurchases. As of August 31, 2004, the Company
had repurchased a total of 1.3 million shares under this program.

The Company makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan, several
defined contribution plans and several multiemployer pension plans.
Contributions vary depending on the plan and are based upon plan provisions,
actuarial valuations and negotiated labor agreements. We anticipate making
contributions of approximately $6.0 million to the various pension plans in
fiscal 2005.

The Company believes its current cash resources, internally generated funds,
existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide
adequate financing for capital expenditures, working capital, joint ventures,
stock repurchases, debt service requirements, post retirement obligations and
future environmental obligations for the next

twelve months. In the longer term, the Company may seek to finance business
expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing.

FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. This Form 10-K, including Item 1 of
Part l and Item 7 of Part II, contains forward-looking statements, within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Act of 1934, that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. One can generally identify
these forward-looking statements because they contain "expect," "believe,"
"anticipate," "estimate," "plans" and other words which convey a similar
meaning. One can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts. Examples of factors affecting Schnitzer Steel
Industries, Inc.'s wholly-owned operations and its joint ventures (the Company)
that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following:

CYCLICALITY AND GENERAL MARKET CONSIDERATIONS: Purchase and selling prices for
recycled metals are highly cyclical in nature and subject to worldwide economic
conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of recycled metals are
subject to global supply and demand conditions which are volatile and beyond the
Company's control, resulting in periodic fluctuations in recycled metals prices
and working capital requirements. While the Company attempts to maintain and
grow margins by responding to changing recycled metals selling prices through
adjustments to its metals purchase prices, the Company's ability to do so is
limited by competitive and other market factors. Additionally, changing prices
could potentially impact the volume of recycled metal available to the Company,
the subsequent volume of processed metal sold by the Company, inventory levels
and the timing of collections and levels relating to the Company's accounts
receivable balances. Moreover, increases in recycled metals selling prices can
adversely affect the operating results of the Company's Steel Manufacturing
Business because increases in steel prices generally lag increases in ferrous
recycled metals prices.

The steel industry is also highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to general
economic conditions. Future economic downturns or a stagnant economy may
adversely affect the performance of the Company.

The Company expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its
revenues and net income. Revenues can fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter
due to factors such as the seasonal slowdown in the construction industry, which
is an important buyer of the Company's finished steel products. The timing and
extent of the slowdown is also dependent on the weather.

Another factor which may affect revenues relates to the seasonal reduction in
demand from foreign customers who tend to reduce their finished steel production
and corresponding scrap metal requirements, during the summer months to offset
higher energy costs. Also, severe weather conditions may affect the Company's
global market conditions.

The Company makes a number of large ferrous recycled metals shipments to foreign
steel producers each year. Customer requirements, shipping schedules and other
factors limit the Company's control over the timing of these shipments.
Variations in the number of foreign shipments from quarter to quarter will
result in fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings. The Company's
expectations regarding ferrous metal sales prices and volumes, as well as
earnings, are based in part on a number of assumptions which are difficult to
predict (for example, uncertainties relating to customer orders, metal
availability, estimated freight rates, ship availability, cost and volume of
unprocessed inventory and production output, etc.).

The Auto Parts Business experiences modest seasonal fluctuations in demand. The
retail stores are open to the elements. During periods of extreme temperatures
and precipitation, customers tend to delay their purchases and wait for milder
conditions. As a result, retail sales are generally higher during the spring and
fall of each calendar year and lower in the winter and summer months.

Additionally, the Auto Parts Business is subject to a number of other risks that
could prevent it from maintaining or exceeding its current levels of
profitability, such as volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices
and volumes in the markets for its products, services and raw materials;
environmental issues; local and worldwide

economic conditions; increased competition; the ultimate success of the
Company's growth and acquisition plans; and business integration and management
transition issues.

COMPETITION: The recycled metals industry is highly competitive, with the volume
of purchases and sales subject to a number of competitive factors, principally
price. The Company competes with both large and numerous smaller companies in
its markets for the purchase of recyclable metals. The Company also competes
with a number of domestic and foreign recycled metals processors and brokers for
processed and unprocessed metal as well as for sales to domestic and foreign
customers. For example, in 2001 and 2002, lower cost ferrous recycled metals
supplies from certain foreign countries adversely affected market selling prices
for ferrous recycled metals. Since then, many of these countries have imposed
export restrictions which have significantly reduced their export volumes and
lowered the worldwide supply of ferrous recycled metals. These restrictions are
believed to have had a positive effect on the Company's selling prices. Given
the intricacies in which the global markets operate, the Company cannot predict
when or if foreign countries will change their trading policies and what effect,
if any, such changes might have on the Company's operating results.

From time to time, both the United States and foreign governments impose
regulations and restrictions on trade in the markets in which the Company
operates. In fiscal 2004, the Company completed filing requirements with China
to continue to allow the shipment of recycled metals into China. The documents
are part of a certification process to ensure safe industrial and agricultural
production in China. Also, it is not unusual for various constituencies to
petition government entities to impose new restrictions or change current laws.
If imposed, these restrictions could affect the Company's margins as well as its
ability to ship goods to foreign customers. Alternatively, restrictions could
also affect the global availability of ferrous recycled metals, thereby
affecting the Company's volumes and margins. As a result, it is difficult to
predict what, if any, impact pending or future trade restrictions will have on
the operations of the Company.

For the Metals Recycling Business, some of the more significant domestic
competitors include regional steel mills and their brokers who compete for
recycled metal for the purpose of providing the mill with feedstock to produce
finished steel. During periods when market supplies of metal are in short
supply, these buyers may, at times, react by raising buying prices to levels
that are not reasonable in relation to more normal market conditions. As a
result, the Company may have to raise its buying prices to maintain its
production levels which may result in compressed margins.

The Auto Parts Business competes with both full-service and self-service auto
dismantlers as well as larger well financed retail auto parts chains for retail
customers. Periodically, the Auto Parts Business increases prices, which may
affect customer flow and buying patterns. Additionally, in markets where the
Company has only a few stores, it does not have the same pricing power it
experiences in markets where it has more than one store in which it operates. As
this segment expands, the Company may experience new competition from others
attempting to replicate the Company's business model. The ultimate impact of
these dynamics cannot be predicted. Also, the business competes for its
automobile inventory with other dismantlers, used car dealers, auto auctions and
metal recyclers. Inventory costs can fluctuate significantly depending on market
conditions and prices for recycled metal.

The domestic steel industry also is highly competitive. Steel prices can be
highly volatile and price is a significant competitive factor. The Company
competes domestically with several steel producers in the Western United States
for sales of its products. In recent years, the Company has experienced
significant foreign competition, which is sometimes subsidized by large
government agencies. There can be no assurance that such competition will not
increase in the future. In the spring of 2002, the U.S. Government imposed
anti-dumping and countervailing duties against wire rod products from eight
foreign countries. These duties have assisted the Company in increasing sales of
wire rod products; any expiration or termination of the duties could have a
corresponding adverse effect.

In December 2002, Nucor Corporation ("Nucor") assumed ownership of the assets of
Birmingham Steel Corp., and acquired a steel manufacturing business in Seattle,
Washington. Nucor Corporation, the leader in setting finished steel prices in
the Company's finished steel markets, has a significant share of the West Coast
steel market and is considered an aggressive competitor. Nucor has consolidated
much of the West Coast domestic steel production with the 2002 purchase of the
former Birmingham Steel Mill in Seattle, Washington and the former North Star
mill in Kingman,

Arizona. The Kingman mill has been idle since 2003, any future start-up of its
operations could negatively impact the Company's recycled metal and finished
steel markets, prices, margins and, potentially, cash flow.

GEOGRAPHICAL CONCENTRATION: The Company competes in the scrap metal business
through its wholly-owned Metals Recycling Business as well as through its joint
venture businesses. Over the last few years, a significant portion of the
revenues and operating profits earned in these segments have been generated from
sales to Asian countries, principally China and South Korea. In addition, the
Company's sales in these countries are also concentrated with relatively few
customers that vary depending on buying cycles and general market conditions.
Due to the concentration of sales in these countries and to a relatively small
customer base, a significant change in buying patterns, change in political
events, change in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other export restrictions
within the United States or these foreign countries, severe weather conditions
or general changes in economic conditions could adversely affect the financial
results of the Company.

UNION CONTRACTS: The Company has a number of union contracts that expire in
fiscal year 2005. Labor contract negotiations have not commenced with any of
these unions. If the Company is unable to reach agreement on the terms of a new
contract with any of these unions, the Company could be subject to work
slowdowns or work stoppages.

POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS: The Company has a number of post retirement benefit
plans that include defined benefit and multiemployer plans. The Company's
contributions to the defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial
calculations which are based on a number of estimates including the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets, allocation of plan assets between
equity or fixed income investments, expected rate of compensation increases as
well as other factors. Changes in these actual rates from year to year cause
increases or decreases in the Company's annual contributions into the defined
benefit plans and changes to the expenses recognized in a current fiscal year.
Management and the actuary evaluate these rates annually and adjust if
necessary.

The Company's union employees participate in a number of multiemployer pension
plans. The Company is not the sponsor or administrator of these multiemployer
plans. Contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of the
negotiated labor contracts. The Company is unable to determine its relative
portion or estimate its future liability under the multiemployer pension plans.

The Company learned during the fourth quarter of 2004 that one of the
multiemployer plans would not meet ERISA minimum funding standards for the plan
year ending September 30, 2004. The trustees of that plan have applied to the
Internal Revenue Service for certain relief from this minimum funding standard,
but cannot determine whether this relief will be granted. Absent relief, the
plan's contributing employers will be required to make additional contributions
or pay excise tax that may equal or exceed the full amount of that deficiency.
The Company estimates its share of the required additional contribution for the
2004 plan year is approximately $1.1 million and has accrued for such amount in
fiscal 2004.

JOINT VENTURES: The Company has significant investments in joint venture
companies, the most substantial of which are its five metals recycling joint
ventures with Hugo Neu Corporation (HNC). In each case, the day-to-day
activities of the joint venture business are managed by the Company's joint
venture partner, not the Company. As a result, the Company does not have the
same ability to control or predict the operations, cash flow, expenditures,
debt, and related financial results as it does with its consolidated businesses.
Therefore, it is difficult to predict the financial results of the joint
ventures.

In recent years, the Company's relationship with the chief executive officer of
HNC, its most significant joint venture partner, has deteriorated. There have
been disagreements regarding business decisions as well as personality clashes,
but the Company does not believe that these issues have materially affected the
operations or operating results of the joint ventures, which have shown dramatic
financial improvement since fiscal 2000. The Company is currently disputing
HNC's recent unilateral assertion of a right to be paid certain commissions on
sales by the joint venture engaged in global brokering of recycled metals, as
described in more detail in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8. As described in Liquidity and Capital Resources above, the Company's
present intention is to not renew the $110 million JV Credit Facility when it
matures in January 2005, and for the Company and HNC to revert to funding the
cash needs of the joint ventures on an equal basis. If HNC does not fund its
share of joint venture cash needs, the operations of the global brokering joint
venture, which has relied extensively on the JV Credit Facility for working
capital support, could be adversely affected.

The Company believes it desirable for the Company and HNC to end the current
joint venture relationships; however, the joint venture agreements do not
provide for a mechanism to break up the ventures. Preliminary discussions
regarding possible transactions to terminate the relationship occur from time to
time, but these discussions have not resulted in any agreement regarding the
structure, valuation or terms of such a transaction. As such discussions
periodically continue, the Company will evaluate its disclosure obligations, but
does not presently intend to make any further disclosure regarding the existence
or status of such discussions unless and until an agreement is reached, if ever.

The Company believes it desirable for the Company and HNC to end the current
joint venture relationships; however, the joint venture agreements do not

or status of such discussions unless and until an agreement is reached, if ever.

The joint venture businesses are affected by many of the same risk factors
mentioned in this document. Additionally, two of these joint ventures continue
to use LIFO inventory accounting, which tends to defer income taxes.
Historically, the effects of LIFO adjustments, which are recorded during the
fourth quarter of each fiscal year, have been difficult to predict.

ENERGY SUPPLY: The Company and its joint ventures utilize various energy sources
to operate their facilities. In particular, electricity and natural gas
currently represent approximately 9% of the cost of steel manufactured for the
Company's Steel Manufacturing Business. The Steel Manufacturing Business
purchases electric power under a long-term contract from McMinnville Water &
Light (McMinnville) which in turn relies on the Bonneville Power Administration
(BPA). Historically, these contracts have had favorable prices and are long-term
in nature. The Company has a five-year contract that expires in September 2006.
On October 1, 2001, the BPA increased its electricity rates due to increased
demand on the West Coast and lower supplies. This increase was in the form of a
Cost Recovery Adjustment Clause (CRAC) added to BPA's contract with McMinnville.
The CRAC is an additional monthly surcharge on selected power charges to recover
costs associated with buying higher priced power during the West Coast power
shortage. Because BPA can adjust the CRAC every six months, it is not possible
to predict future rate changes.

The Steel Manufacturing Business also has a contract for natural gas at $4.50
MMBTU. The current contract expires on May 31, 2009 and obligates the business
to purchase minimum amounts of gas at a fixed rate. Effective November 1, 2004,
the natural gas rate will be reduced to $4.39 per MMBTU. This is a take or pay
contract with a minimum average usage of 3,575 MMBTU per day. Gas not used is
sold on the open market and gains or losses are recorded in cost of sales.

If the Company is unable to negotiate favorable terms of electricity, natural
gas and other energy sources, this could adversely affect the performance of the
Company.

TAX LAWS: The Company has been able to reduce its effective tax rate below the
federal statutory tax rate for each of the last three years by using a
combination of Net Operating Loss carryforwards (NOLs), tax credits in State of
California Enterprise Zones, and federal Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI)
tax benefits associated with making foreign sales. In response to recent
determinations by the World Trade Organization that the ETI tax benefit
constituted an illegal export subsidy, Congress passed the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the Act), which became law on October 22, 2004. A key
provision of the Act eliminates the ETI deduction over the next two years,
offsetting it in part with a deduction for "qualified production activities
income." Until regulations are issued explaining the new deduction, any
projection of its effect on the Company's worldwide tax rate would necessarily
be imprecise, but the current projection is that the tax rate would approximate
36% in fiscal 2005.

The Company's worldwide tax rate is also apt to be higher in fiscal 2005 for two
reasons unrelated to the Act: All net operation losses (NOLs) have been used for
GAAP purposes, and further discovery of significant state tax credits is
unlikely. As noted above, both items have served to reduce the effective tax
rate in recent years.

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS: Demand from the Company's foreign customers is partially
driven by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Recent
weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies has been a
significant factor in the increases in recycled metals prices over the last
year, as well as resulted in increasing the cost of certain finished steel
imports. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the
competitiveness of the Company's products in the markets in which the Company
competes. The Company has no control over such fluctuations and, as such, these
dynamics could affect the Company's revenues and earnings.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING: Both the Metals Recycling Business and the Steel
Manufacturing Business often rely on third parties to handle and transport their
products to end users in a timely manner. The cost to transport the products, in
particular by ocean freight, can be affected by circumstances over which the
Company has no control such as fuel prices, political events, governmental
regulations on transportation and changes in market rates due to carrier
availability. In estimating future operating results, the Company makes certain
assumptions regarding shipping costs. Given the recent tightness in the ocean
freight market, the Company has experienced significant increases in its
shipping costs which have adversely affected operating income. Since it is
difficult to predict the future costs for shipping the Company's products,
actual results could differ materially from forecasts.

INSURANCE: The cost of the Company's insurance is affected not only by its own
loss experience but also by cycles in the insurance market. The Company cannot
predict future events and circumstances which could cause rates to materially
change such as war, terrorist activities or natural disasters.

ASSET ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION: Throughout the Company's history, it has made
a number of acquisitions and divestures as management attempts to improve the
value of the Company for its shareholders. Over the last few years this activity
has principally been limited to acquisitions related to the Auto Parts Business.
It is anticipated that the Company will continue to pursue additional expansion
of the Auto Parts Business as well as other business segments. Each acquisition
or disposition comes with its own inherent risks that make it difficult to
predict the ultimate success of the transaction. An acquisition or disposition
may have a negative and/or unexpected impact on the Company's cash flow,
operating income, net income, earnings per share and financial position.

INTERCOMPANY SALES: The Auto Parts Business sells autobodies to the Metals
Recycling Business, and the Metals Recycling Business sells ferrous recycled
metal to the Steel Manufacturing Business, at prices that are intended to
approximate market. When the Company consolidates its results in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, the Company eliminates the
intercompany sales and purchases and also eliminates the estimated profit
remaining in inventory ("Profit Elimination") at the end of each reporting
period. In estimating future operating and financial performance, the Company
makes assumptions regarding the forecasted Profit Elimination computation and
its impact on the quarterly financial results of the Company. Small variations
in price, sales volume, production volume, and purchase prices and volumes from
both within the Company and from third parties can result in significant
differences between forecasted Profit Elimination and actual results.

It is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual
results to differ from the Company's forward-looking statements. Consequently,
the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all
potential risks or uncertainties. Further, the Company does not assume any
obligation to update any forward-looking statement.



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure
to changes in interest rates. Because such derivative instruments are used
solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, they do not represent
incremental risk to the Company. For further discussion of derivative financial
instruments, refer to "FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS" in the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8, Note 1 of the "Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements".

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM








To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, of retained earnings
and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Schnitzer Steel Industries and its subsidiaries at August 31, 2004
and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended August 31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

NATURE OF BUSINESS

Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (the Company) operates a metal recycling
business, a self-service used auto parts business, and, through its Cascade
Steel Rolling Mills, Inc. subsidiary, a mini-mill steel manufacturing business.
The Company's facilities are located primarily in the western United States and
Canada, but our Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business have a strong
presence in the eastern United States.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company, through
subsidiaries, holds a 50% interest in nine joint ventures and a 30% interest in
one, which are accounted for using the equity method. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describe an
acquisition that occurred on February 14, 2003. Under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS No. 141), "Business Combinations," the
acquisition is considered a "step" acquisition due to the fact that the Company
had a significant joint venture interest in the acquired business for a number
of years. Additionally, since the acquisition occurred during fiscal 2003, the
Company elected to include it in the consolidated results as though it had
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2003. Thus, the 2003 statement of
operations, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows have been adjusted to
consolidate the acquisition as of September 1, 2002. Also, the acquired
businesses were consolidated with the Company's previous interest in the
business to form a separate reporting segment called the Auto Parts Business.
Additionally, consolidation accounting requires the Company to adjust its
earnings for the ownership interests it did not own during the reporting period.
For fiscal 2003, net income was reduced by $2.5 million of pre-acquisition
interests, net of income taxes, representing the share of income attributable to
the former joint venture partner prior to the acquisition. The financial results
of the acquired business for periods prior to fiscal 2003 continue to be
accounted for using the equity method and are included in the joint venture
businesses reporting segment.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term securities that have an original
maturity date of 90 days or less.

INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using
the average cost method. The production and accounting process utilized by the
Company to record recycled metals inventory quantities relies on significant
estimates, which can be affected by weight imprecision, moisture, production
yields and other factors.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Major renewals and
improvements are capitalized. Substantially all expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

Depreciation is determined principally using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives of approximately 20 to 40 years for buildings and
approximately 3 to 15 years for equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the estimated useful lives of the property or the remaining lease term,
whichever is less. When assets are retired or sold, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and resulting gains or
losses are generally included in operating income.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS No. 142), "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets" requires that intangibles with finite useful lives
be reviewed for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144 (SFAS No. 144), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets." In September 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, which
supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS No. 121),
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed of", and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the
Results of Operation-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions." SFAS No. 144 establishes a single accounting model for long-lived
assets to be disposed of by sale, whether they were previously held and used or
newly acquired, and it also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations
to include more disposal transactions. The Company assesses its long-lived
assets for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash
flows whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger
an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant
underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results,
significant changes in the manner in which an asset is utilized and substantial
negative industry or economic trends. When such events or changes in
circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived
assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be
recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future
undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the
Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount
over the fair value of the assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144.

GOODWILL
Effective September 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142,"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS No.
142). This statement changed the accounting for goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets from an amortization approach to an impairment-only approach.
As required under the transitional accounting provisions of SFAS No. 142, the
Company completed steps during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 to identify and
measure goodwill impairment at its two reporting units, which existed at the
time of adoption, the Metals Recycling Business and the Steel Manufacturing
Business. The reporting units were measured for impairment by comparing the
implied fair value of the reporting units' goodwill with the carrying amount of
the goodwill. Historical earnings were used as a basis to project future
earnings to determine whether any impairment of goodwill existed at the
reporting units. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that
goodwill associated with its Steel Manufacturing Business was impaired. The
Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge for the entire $983,000 of
remaining goodwill, effective September 1, 2002, and reported it as a
"Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" on the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. The goodwill was not deductible for tax purposes, thus
the amount was not tax affected. The implementation of SFAS No. 142 required the
use of judgments, estimates and assumptions in the determination of fair value
and impairment amounts related to the required testing. Prior to adoption of
SFAS No. 142, the Company had historically evaluated goodwill for impairment by
comparing the entity level unamortized balance of goodwill to projected
undiscounted cash flows, which did not result in an indicated impairment. The
Company performs impairment tests annually and whenever events and circumstances
indicate that the value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets
might be impaired. The following table presents the Company's intangible assets
and their related lives:

Options with an exercise price greater than the average market price were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so would
be antidilutive. These options totaled 267,000 in 2003 and 1,757,700 in 2002. No
options were antidilutive in fiscal 2004.

The Company records stock-based compensation under the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB
25) and related Interpretations. Under this method, compensation expense for its
stock incentive plans is determined using the intrinsic value method.
Accordingly, because the exercise price equals the market price on the date of
the grant, no compensation expense is recognized by the Company for stock
options issued to employees and directors. The Company recorded compensation
expense in fiscal 2004 of $0.6 million due to accelerating the vesting period on
stock options for a retired employee.

On December 31, 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148 (SFAS No. 148), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure," which amends Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (SFAS No. 123), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."
SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for voluntary change to
the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. In addition,
SFAS No. 148 requires more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. At this
time, the Company has elected to adopt the annual and interim disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 148.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTEREST AND INCOME TAXES PAID
The Company paid $2.3 million, $1.5 million and $2.4 million in interest expense
during fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In fiscal years 2004 and
2003, the Company paid $50.3 million and $17.2 million in income taxes,
respectively. During fiscal 2002, the Company received tax refunds of $0.5
million.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Cash, receivables and current liabilities in the consolidated financial
statements are considered to reflect the fair value because of the short-term
maturity of these instruments. The fair value of long-term debt is deemed to be
the same as that reflected in the consolidated financial statements given the
variable interest rates on the significant credit facilities. There are no
quoted prices for the Company's investments in joint ventures accounted for on
the equity method. A reasonable estimate of fair value could not be made without
incurring excessive costs.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue when it has a contract or purchase order from a
customer with a fixed price, the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer
and collectibility is reasonably assured. Title for both metals and finished
steel products transfers upon shipment, based on either C.I.F. or F.O.B. terms.
For retail sales by the Auto Parts Business, revenues are recognized when
customers pay for salvaged parts or when wholesale products are shipped to the
customer location. Substantially all of the Company's ferrous export sales of
recycled metal are made with letters of credit, minimizing credit risk. However,
domestic ferrous recycled metal sales, nonferrous sales and sales of finished
steel are generally made on open account. Historically, there have been very few
sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues;
therefore no provisions are made when the sale is recognized.

All shipping costs billed to customers are recorded as revenue with the related
costs being included under cost of sales.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
The Company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts, notes and advances
receivable based on a combination of factors. In cases where management is aware
of circumstances that may impair a specific customer's ability to meet its
financial obligations to the Company, management records a specific allowance
against amounts due and reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount we
reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, the Company
maintains a reserve that considers the total receivables outstanding, historical
collection rates and economic trends.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS
The estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are
accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the Company has
incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. When
only a range of amounts is established, and no amount within the range is better
than another, the minimum amount of the range is recorded. Recoveries of
environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when
realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable and reasonably
estimable.

RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal year 2004
presentation. These changes had no impact on previously reported results of
operations or shareholder's equity.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In January 2003, FASB revised FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities" (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a variable interest
entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority

of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or entitled
to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. FIN 46R also
requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not
required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The
consolidation requirements of FIN 46R apply immediately to variable interest
entities created after January 31, 2003 and to existing entities in the first
fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company has
determined that it does not have relationships with any entities which meet the
definition of a variable interest entity.

NOTE 3 - BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:

CANADIAN ACQUISITION
- --------------------
On March 8, 2004, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, PNP Auto
Parts Canada Co., acquired the assets and leased the sites of three self-service
used auto parts stores in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta and Kelowna, British
Columbia from Sheppard Holdings Ltd. of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, or its
affiliates. The three stores currently operate under the name of Pick Your Part.
This acquisition expands the geographic scope of our Auto Parts Business into
the Canadian market as part of our strategy to grow the business in North
America. The acquisition was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The
purchase price ($13.7 million) and the results of operations for these three
stores are reflected in the consolidated results of the Company beginning with
the 2004 third fiscal quarter. Of the total purchase price, $13.2 million was
related to goodwill. For further information related to goodwill, refer to Note
1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

PICK-N-PULL BUSINESS COMBINATION
- --------------------------------
On February 14, 2003, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Norprop, Inc.
("Norprop") closed its acquisition (the "Acquisition") of all of the stock of
Pick and Pull Auto Dismantling, Inc., which was the Company's 50% partner in
Pick-N-Pull Auto Dismantlers, a California general partnership (the "Joint
Venture") and all of the membership interests in Pick-N-Pull Auto Dismantlers,
Stockton, LLC ("Stockton"). The cost of the Acquisition consisted of $71.4
million of cash paid to the seller at closing, $3.3 million of debt assumed and
immediately paid off, $0.6 million of acquisition costs and $0.5 million of tax
related expenses. In addition, Norprop assumed approximately $12.5 million of
debt owed by the Joint Venture to the Company. Two additional payments were made
during fiscal 2004. The first payment of $4.7 million was made during the fiscal
quarter ended November 30, 2003, as a result of an amendment to the Purchase
Agreement. The second and final payment of $7.1 million was made during the
fiscal quarter ended February 29, 2004, and related to a purchase price
adjustment one year after closing based upon calendar year 2002 and 2003
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of the
acquired Auto Parts Business. The total purchase price was $100.1 million (or
$96.5 million net of the seller's $3.6 million share of the Joint Venture's cash
on hand at closing).

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following is a summary of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition (in millions):

      Property, plant and equipment            $     13.3
      Identified intangible assets                    3.7
      Other assets                                    5.4
      Liabilities                                    (3.8)
      Goodwill                                       81.5

                                               ==========

Goodwill of $81.5 million represents the excess of purchase price over the fair
value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired, and, as a
result of a tax election filed jointly by the Company and seller, substantially
all of it will be deductible for tax purposes over a 15-year period. Also,
approximately $1.8 million of goodwill existed on the Joint Venture's balance
sheet prior to the Acquisition but was not shown separately in accordance with
the equity method of accounting. Therefore, the total increase to goodwill
related to the Acquisition was $83.3 million. In accordance with SFAS142,
goodwill is not amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually.

NOTE 5 - IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER NONRECURRING CHARGES:

During fiscal 2002, the Company's Portland, Oregon metals recycling facility
embarked on a dock and loading facility renovation. The renovation was suspended
in fiscal 2003 when issues with the dock's substructure were detected. Upon
review of new engineering designs focused on operational efficiency and safety
specifications, an impairment charge of $3.5 million was recorded in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004 to write-off renovation costs incurred prior to the
suspension.

In connection with the acquisition of the Auto Parts Business, the Company
conducted an environmental due diligence investigation. Based upon new
information obtained in this investigation, the Joint Venture accrued $2.1
million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 for
remediation costs at the Auto Parts Business's store locations. No environmental
proceedings are pending at any of these sites.

The Company recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges of $7.1 million
in fiscal 2002. The Company recorded nonrecurring charges of $1.9 million for
the early termination of a fixed-price Alaska barge contract of affreightment
that management determined was not cost effective. The Alaska barge contract
charge included a $0.9 million write-off of a note receivable and a $1.0 million
payment to terminate the contract. Also, an impairment charge of $1.8 million
was recorded for the elimination of an unprofitable car-crushing business and an
impairment charge of $1.1 million was recorded for the closure of an
under-performing yard in Reno, Nevada. Nonrecurring charges of $1.5 million were
recorded for the loss on the early termination of two vessel charter contracts
with a related company. The Company terminated the leases in order to take
advantage of market rates which were $7 to $8 per ton lower than the all-in
contracted rates (see Note 9 "Related Party Transactions"). Shipping cost
savings as a result of the contract termination totaled approximately $2.0
million. Additionally, a loss of $0.8 million was recorded for the sale of a
non-strategic steel forging business.

In May 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to refinance its revolving
bank credit facility. The facility for $150 million is unsecured, matures in May
2006 and bears interest at varying interest rates. As of August 31, 2004, such
rates on outstanding borrowings averaged 2.7%. Interest is payable at varying
dates not to exceed the maturity of each advance under the line. The credit
facility contains a provision whereby the Company may, upon obtaining consent of
the bank group, extend the terms of the agreement by one year to May 2007. The
Company has provided notice of its intention to request such an extension and
the bank group has agreed to the request. The extension is subject to the
Company providing standard representations and warranties as of the May 2006
original maturity date. The Company currently anticipates it will be able to
provide the required representations and warranties and the agreement will be
extended.

NOTE 7 - ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES:

PORTLAND HARBOR
In December 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) named
the Portland Harbor, a 5.5 mile stretch of the Willamette River in Portland,
Oregon, as a Superfund site. The Company's metals recycling and deep water
terminal facility in Portland, Oregon is located adjacent to the Portland
Harbor. Crawford Street Corporation, a Company subsidiary, also owns property
adjacent to the Portland Harbor. The EPA has identified 69 potentially
responsible parties (PRPs), including the Company and Crawford Street
Corporation, which own or operate sites adjacent to the Portland Harbor
Superfund site. The Company leases the metals recycling and deep water terminal
facility from Schnitzer Investment Corp. (SIC), a related party, and is
obligated under its lease with SIC to bear the costs relating to the
investigation and remediation of the property. The precise nature and extent of
any clean-up of the Portland Harbor, the parties to be involved, and the process
to be followed for such a clean-up have not yet been determined. It is unclear
whether or to what extent the Company or Crawford Street Corporation will be
liable for environmental costs or damages associated with the Superfund site. It
is also unclear whether natural resource damage claims or third party
contribution or damages claims will be asserted against the Company. While the
Company and Crawford Street Corporation participated in certain preliminary
Portland Harbor study efforts, they are not parties to the consent order entered
into by the EPA with other PRPs (Lower Willamette Group) for a Remedial
Investigation/Feasibility Study; however the Company could become liable for a
share of the costs of this study at a later stage of the proceedings.

Separately, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has requested
operating history and other information from numerous persons and entities which
own or conduct operations on properties adjacent to or upland from the Portland
Harbor, including the Company and Crawford Street Corporation. The DEQ
investigations at the Company and Crawford Street sites are focused on
controlling any current releases of contaminants into the Willamette River. The
Company has agreed to a voluntary Remedial Investigation/Source Control effort
with the DEQ regarding its Portland, Oregon deep water terminal facility and the
site owned by Crawford Street Corporation. DEQ identified these sites as
potential sources of contaminants that could be released into the Willamette
River. The Company believes that improvements in the operations at these sites,
often referred to as Best Management Practices (BMPs), will be sufficient to
effectively provide source control and avoid the release of contaminants from
these sites, and has proposed to DEQ the implementation of BMPs as the
resolution of this investigation.

While the cost of the investigations associated with these properties and the
cost of employment of source control BMPs are not expected to be material at
August 31, 2004, however $0.3 million has been accrued for studies related to

the pending six mile Portland Working Harbor Willamette River sediment Superfund
site. No estimate is currently possible and none has been made as to the cost of
remediation for the Portland Harbor or the Company's adjacent properties.

MANUFACTURING MANAGEMENT, INC.
In 1994, Manufacturing Management, Inc. (MMI) recorded a reserve for the
estimated cost to cure certain environmental liabilities. This reserve was
carried over to the Company's financial statements when MMI was acquired in
1995, and at August 31, 2004, aggregated $15.1 million.

General Metals of Tacoma (GMT), a subsidiary of MMI, owns and operates a metals
recycling facility located in the State of Washington on the Hylebos Waterway, a
part of Commencement Bay, which is the subject of an ongoing remediation project
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
GMT and more than 60 other parties were named potentially responsible parties
(PRPs) for the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sediment along the
Hylebos Waterway. On March 25, 2002, EPA issued Unilateral Administrative Orders
(UAOs) to GMT and another party (Other Party) to proceed with Remedial Design
and Remedial Action (RD/RA) for the head of the Hylebos and to two other parties
to proceed with the RD/RA for the balance of the waterway. The issuance of the
UAOs did not require the Company to change its previously recorded estimate of
environmental liabilities for this site. The UOA for the head of the Hylebos
Waterway was converted to a voluntary consent decree in May 2004, pursuant to
which GMT and the Other Party agreed to remediate the head of the Hylebos
Waterway. The consent decree was finalized and entered by the court in September
2004, at which time approximately $7.0 million in settlement funds previously
collected by the EPA from other PRPs became available for reimbursement of
remediation costs incurred by GMT and the Other Party. As of May 31, 2004, the
Company recorded $3.5 million in other current assets representing the Company's
share of the expected EPA reimbursements and, because the expectation of
contributions from other PRPs in this amount had previously been taken into
account as a reduction in the Company's reserve for environmental liabilities,
the Company also recorded a $3.5 million increase in environmental liabilities.

There are two phases to the Clean-up of the Hylebos Waterway. The first phase
was the intertidal and bank remediation, which was conducted in 2003 and early
2004. The second phase is dredging in the Head of Hylebos Waterway, which began
on July 15, 2004. Approximately 117,500 cubic yards of an estimated 310,000
cubic yards total have been removed as of October 30, 2004. Dredging and other
in-water work is scheduled to be completed during fiscal 2005.

GMT and the Other Party may pursue legal actions against other non-settling,
non-performing PRPs to recover additional amounts that may be applied against
the head of the Hylebos remediation costs. Significant uncertainties continue to
exist regarding the total cost to remediate this site as well as the Company's
share of those costs; nevertheless, the Company's estimate of its liabilities
related to this site is based on information currently available.

The Natural Resource Damage Trustees (Trustees) for Commencement Bay have
asserted claims against GMT and other PRPs within the Hylebos Waterway area for
alleged damage to natural resources. In March 2002, the Trustees delivered a
draft settlement proposal to GMT and others in which the Trustees suggested a
methodology for resolving the dispute, but did not indicate any proposed damages
or cost amounts. In June 2002, GMT responded to the Trustees' draft settlement
proposal with various corrections and other comments, as did twenty other
participants. It is unknown at this time whether, or to what extent, GMT will be
liable for natural resource damages. The Company's previously recorded
environmental liabilities include an estimate of the Company's potential
liability for these claims.

The Washington State Department of Ecology named GMT, along with a number of
other parties, as Potentially Liable Parties (PLPs) for a site referred to as
Tacoma Metals. GMT operated on this site under a lease prior to 1982. The
property owner and current operator have taken the lead role in performing a
Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the site. The RI/FS is
now completed and the parties are currently involved in a mediation settlement
process to address cost allocations. The Company's previously recorded
environmental liabilities include an estimate of the Company's potential
liability at this site.

MMI is also a named PRP at two third-party sites at which it allegedly disposed
of transformers. At one site, MMI entered into a settlement under which it paid
$825,000 towards remediation of the site. Remediation of the site has been
completed and it is now subject to a five year monitoring program. The other
site has not yet been subject to significant remedial investigation. MMI has
been named as a PRP at several other sites for which it has agreed to de minimis
settlements. In addition to the matters discussed above, the Company's
environmental reserve includes amounts for potential future cleanup of other
sites at which MMI has conducted business or has allegedly disposed of other
materials.

PROLER
In 1996, prior to the Company's acquisition of Proler International Corp.
(Proler), Proler recorded a liability for the probable costs to remediate its
wholly-owned properties. The Company carried over the aggregate reserve to its
financial statements upon acquiring Proler, and $3.4 million remained
outstanding on August 31, 2004.

As part of the Proler acquisition, the Company became a 50% owner of Hugo
Neu-Proler Company (HNP). HNP has agreed, as part of its 1996 lease renewal with
the Port of Los Angeles (POLA), to conduct a multi-year, phased remedial
clean-up project involving certain environmental conditions on its metals
recycling facility at its Terminal Island site in Los Angeles, California, which
was completed in 2002. HNP is waiting for final certification from POLA and the
regulatory agencies overseeing the cleanup. Remediation included excavation and
off-site disposal of contaminated soils, paving and groundwater monitoring.
Other environmentally protective actions included installation of a stormwater
management system and construction of a noise barrier and perimeter wall around
a substantial portion of the facility.

Additionally, other Proler joint venture sites with potential environmental
clean-up issues have been identified. Estimated clean-up costs associated with
these sites have been accrued for by the joint ventures.

In connection with the acquisition of the Auto Parts Business, the Company
conducted an environmental due diligence investigation. Based upon new
information obtained in this investigation, the Joint Venture accrued $2.1
million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 for
remediation costs at the Auto Parts Business's store locations. No environmental
proceedings are pending at any of these sites.

The Company considers various factors when estimating its environmental
liabilities. Adjustments to the liabilities are made when additional information
becomes available that affects the estimated costs to remediate. The factors,
which the Company considers in its recognition and measurement of environmental
liabilities, include the following:

      o    Current regulations both at the time the reserve is established and
           during the course of the clean-up which specify standards for
           acceptable remediation;
      o    Information about the site, which becomes available as the site is
           studied and remediated;
      o    The professional judgment of both senior-level internal staff and
           external consultants who take into account similar, recent instances
           of environmental remediation issues, among other considerations;
      o    Technologies available that can be used for remediation; and
      o    The number and financial condition of other potentially responsible
           parties and the extent of their responsibility for the remediation.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES
The Company and Hugo Neu Corporation ("HNC") are the 50% members of Hugo Neu
Schnitzer Global Trade, LLC ("HNSGT"), a joint venture engaged in global
brokering of recycled metals. HNC manages the day-to-day activities of HNSGT. In
January 2004, HNC advised the Company that it would charge HNSGT a 1% commission
on HNSGT's recycled metal sales, and began deducting those commissions. While
some reasonable reimbursement of HNC's costs may be appropriate, the Company has
responded that the 1% commission is excessive and that HNC has no authority to
unilaterally impose such commissions on HNSGT. The Company has not yet commenced
litigation in this dispute. For fiscal 2004, the Company estimated that its 50%
share of the disputed commissions totaled $2.5 million. In recording operating
income from joint ventures, the Company has excluded from joint venture expenses
the excess of these disputed commissions over the Company's estimate of
reasonable reimbursements.

Until recently, the Company had a practice of paying commissions to the
purchasing managers of customers in connection with export sales of recycled
ferrous metals to the Far East. The Company was recently advised that this
practice may raise questions of possible violations of U.S. and foreign laws,
and the practice was stopped. Thereafter, the Audit Committee was advised and
conducted a preliminary compliance review. On November 18, 2004, on the
recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors authorized the
Audit Committee to engage independent counsel and conduct a thorough,
independent investigation and directed that the existence and the results of the
investigation be voluntarily reported to the U.S. Department of Justice and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and that the Company cooperate fully with
those agencies. The investigation is not expected to affect the Company's
previously reported financial results, including those reported in these
consolidated financial statements. The Company cannot predict the results of the
investigation or whether the Company or any of its employees will be subject to
any penalties or other remedial actions following completion of the
investigation.

The reasons for the difference between the effective income tax rate and the
statutory federal income tax rate are as follows:

                                            ========     ========     ========


The Company's effective tax rate of 31% for fiscal 2004 is lower than the 35%
federal statutory tax rate for two primary reasons. First, the Company continues
to benefit from federal tax law's Extraterritorial Income Exclusion (ETI), which
has the effect of taxing export sales at a lesser rate than comparable domestic
sales. The estimated ETI benefit for the year ended August 31, 2004 was
approximately 3%. Secondly, the reduced tax rate benefited from the release of
NOL valuation reserves. As part of the 1996 acquisition of Proler International,
Inc., the Company succeeded to federal income tax Net Operating Loss ("NOLs")
and minimum tax credit carryforwards. In accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP), valuation reserves were then established against
the NOLs and credits because management was uncertain whether the Company's
future taxable income and tax would be sufficient to use them. Part of the
uncertainty regarding use of the NOLs stemmed from two Federal tax law
constraints, one limiting their use to $2.4 million a year and the other
requiring that they be used by 2011. Management would assess the continuing need
for the valuation reserves each fiscal year, and would release them only to the
extent that the uncertainty regarding their use was judged to be mitigated. In
each of fiscal years 2003 and 2002, management released valuation reserves of
$0.8 million.

During fiscal 2004, however, management released the remaining $6.1 million
balance in the reserves because it determined that it was more likely than not
that future taxable income and tax would be sufficient to absorb the remaining
NOLs of $15.3 million and the credits of $0.7 million. This determination was
based upon a number of factors including profitability trends, industry
fundamentals and recent profitable acquisitions. The reversal had no effect on
cash flows, as those are only affected by the present and future use of the NOLs
against taxable income and the credits against tax.

The effective tax rates for fiscal 2004 and 2003 are higher than that for fiscal
2002 because the Company qualified for $2.1 million of California Enterprise
Zone credits in fiscal 2002. These credits can be used to offset California
state income taxes to the extent that each corporation in the consolidated group
has a California franchise (income) tax liability on taxable income
apportionable to each zone. Any credits in excess of the tax liability can be
carried forward indefinitely. The Company has qualified for additional minor
amounts of these credits in fiscal 2004 and 2003.

NOTE 9 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

Certain shareholders of the Company own significant interest in, or are related
to owners of, the entities discussed below. As such, these entities are
considered related parties for financial reporting purposes.

TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING COST OF GOODS SOLD
Historically, the Company chartered vessels from related companies at market
rates to transport recycled metal to foreign markets. The number of vessels
chartered varied from year to year depending on the availability of their
vessels. In December 2003, the related party exited the shipping business and
consequently this relationship ended. No charter fees were paid to the related
party in fiscal 2004. However, charter fees paid to the related party were $1.9
million and $9.8 million for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.

A primary reason for entering into a number of the Company's joint ventures was
to secure the supply of recyclable metal for the Metals Recycling Business. The
Company purchased recycled metals from its joint venture operations at prices
that approximate market. Purchases from these joint ventures totaled $9.7
million, $5.0 million and $10.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company leases certain land and buildings from Schnitzer Investment Corp.

Rent expense was $2.2 million, $2.1 million, and $1.9 million, for 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

In accordance with a lease agreement dated September 1988, the rent for the
Metals Recycling Business's Portland facility was adjusted in 2003 and will be
adjusted every 15 years thereafter to market rates, but only if such adjustment
results in an increase in rent. In 2008, and every five years thereafter, except
in the year of a market rate adjustment, the rent will be adjusted based on the
Consumer and Producer Price Indices.

TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
The Company performs some administrative services and provides operation and
maintenance of management information systems for certain related parties. These
services are charged to the related parties based upon cost plus a 15% margin
for overhead and profit. These administrative charges totaled $0.6 million, $0.9
million, and $1.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)
Included in other assets are $1.0 million and $1.1 million of notes receivable
from joint venture businesses at August 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

NOTE 10 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:

Primary actuarial assumptions are determined as follows:

      o   The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our
          estimate of long-term returns for equities and fixed income securities
          weighted by the allocation of assets in the plans. The rate is
          impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it
          represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by
          short-term market swings. Changes in the allocation of plan assets
          would also impact this rate.
      o   The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit
          obligations back to today's dollars. The U.S. discount rate is as of
          the measurement date, August 31. This rate is sensitive to changes in
          interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our
          obligation and expense.
      o   The expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit
          obligations using projected pay at retirement. This rate represents
          average long-term salary increases and is influenced by our
          compensation policies. An increase in this rate would increase our
          obligation and expense.


DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS
For certain nonunion employees, the Company maintains a defined benefit pension
plan. The asset value of the plan is based on the market value which represents
its fair value. The following table sets forth the change in benefit obligation,

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we
consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and
expected returns on various categories of plan assets. We apply our expected
rate of return to a market related value of the assets which reduces the
underlying variability in assets to which we apply that expected return. We
amortize gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial
assumptions and plan provisions over a period no longer than the average future
service of employees.

PLAN ASSET ALLOCATIONS. The Company's asset allocation for its pension plan is
based on the primary goal of maximizing investment returns over the long-term.
At the same time the Company has invested in a diversified portfolio so as to
provide a balance of returns and risk. In an effort to quantify this allocation,
the Company has established a target guideline to be used in determining the
investment mix.

The table below shows the Company's target allocation range along with the
actual allocations at August 31:

                                  TARGET         ACTUAL 2004       ACTUAL 2003

ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS. The following benefit payments, which reflect
expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

                                 BENEFITS

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
The Company has several defined contribution plans covering nonunion employees.
The pension cost related to these plans totaled $1.4 million, $1.2 million and
$1.1 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS
In accordance with collective bargaining agreements, the Company contributed to
multiemployer pension plans $3.1 million, $2.5 million, and $2.3 million in
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company is not the sponsor or
administrator of these multiemployer plans. Contributions were determined in
accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. The Company is unable
to determine its relative portion of or estimate its future liability under the
plans.

The Company learned during the fourth quarter of 2004 that one of the
multiemployer plans would not meet ERISA minimum funding standards for the plan
year ending September 30, 2004. The trustees of that plan have applied to the
Internal Revenue Service for certain relief from this minimum funding standard,
but cannot determine whether this relief will be granted. Absent relief, the
plan's contributing employers will be required to make additional contributions
or pay excise tax that may equal or exceed the full amount of that deficiency.
The Company estimates its share of the required additional contribution for the
2004 plan year is approximately $1.1 million and has accrued for such amount in
fiscal 2004.

OTHER BENEFITS
The Company has adopted a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan for certain
executives. A restricted trust fund has been established and invested in life
insurance policies which can be used for plan benefits, but are subject to
claims of general creditors. The trust fund and deferred compensation expense
are classified as other assets. The status of this plan is summarized as follows
as of August 31, (in thousands):
                                                 2004                 2003

The trust fund assets stock market gains and losses are included in other income
(expense). During fiscal 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized gains totaling
$0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, and losses of $0.4 million during
fiscal 2002.

NOTE 11 - STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN:

The Company has adopted a stock incentive plan for employees, consultants and
directors of the Company. The plan covers 7,200,000 shares of Class A common
stock. All options have a ten-year term and, except for options granted in
fiscal 2001, become exercisable for 20% of the shares covered by the option on
each of the first five anniversaries of the grant. The options granted in fiscal
2001 become exercisable as follows: 33% after one year from the date of grant,
66% after two years from the date of grant, and 100% after two and one-half
years from the date of grant. The vesting periods for these options varied from
the standard because the Company granted them to certain employees in lieu of
annual salary revisions.

Pro forma information for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 regarding net income
and earnings per share has been determined as if the Company had accounted for
its employee stock options under the fair value method. The per share weighted
average grant date fair value for these awards, as determined by applying the
Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $12.66, $7.82 and $6.36 during the years
ended August 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, using the following

NOTE 12 - SEGMENT INFORMATION:

The Company operates in three industry segments: metal processing and recycling
(Metals Recycling Business), mini-mill steel manufacturing (Steel Manufacturing
Business) and self-service used auto parts (Auto Parts Business). Additionally,
the Company is a non-controlling partner in joint ventures, which are either in
the metals recycling business or are suppliers of unprocessed metals. The
Company also considers these to be separate segments because they are managed
separately. These joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. As
such, the operating information provided below related to the joint ventures is
shown separately from consolidated information, except for the Company's equity
in the net income of, investment in and advances to the joint ventures.

The Metals Recycling Business buys and processes ferrous and nonferrous metals
for sale to foreign and other domestic steel producers or their representatives
and to the Steel Manufacturing Business. The Metals Recycling Business also
purchases ferrous metals from other processors for shipment directly to the
Steel Manufacturing Business.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


The Steel Manufacturing Business produces rebar, merchant bar, wire rod, coiled
rebar and other specialty products.

The Auto Parts Business purchases salvaged vehicles, sells parts from those
vehicles through its retail facilities and wholesale operations, and sells the
remaining portion of the vehicles to metal recyclers, including the Metals
Recycling Business. Note 3 describes the acquisition that occurred on February
14, 2003.

Intersegment sales from the Metals Recycling Business to the Steel Manufacturing
Business, and from the Auto Parts Business to the Metals Recycling Business, are
transferred at negotiated market rates per ton. These intercompany sales tend to
produce intercompany profits, which are eliminated until the finished products
are ultimately sold to third parties.

The Joint Ventures in the metals recycling business are also engaged in buying,
processing and selling primarily ferrous metal. Recycled metals are sold to
foreign and domestic steel mills.

The Joint Venture suppliers of metals are industrial plant demolition
contractors. These joint ventures dismantle industrial plants, perform
environmental remediation and sell recovered metals and machinery. The Company
purchases substantially all of the ferrous recycled metals generated by these
joint ventures.

The information provided below is obtained from internal information that is
provided to the Company's chief operating decision-maker for the purpose of
corporate management. The Company does not allocate corporate interest income
and expense, income taxes or other income and expenses related to corporate
activity to its operating segments.

                                                                   -------------

                        SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES. INC.

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED

                     ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED ("EVA") BONUS PLAN

                          EFFECTIVE DATE: JULY 15, 2004

The following are the terms of the Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (the
"COMPANY", "SCHNITZER STEEL" or "SSI") EVA ("ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED") Bonus Plan
(the "PLAN") for certain employees of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, including Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Inc. ("CASCADE STEEL") (but
excluding its subsidiary, Pick-N-Pull Auto Dismantlers, which is subject to a
separate EVA Bonus Plan), as amended and restated, effective July 15, 2004.
References to the "COMPANY", "SCHNITZER STEEL" or "SSI" shall be deemed to refer
instead to a wholly owned subsidiary as the context requires for a particular
employee, employed by such subsidiary.

A.     1.     Purpose of the Bonus Plan
              -------------------------

              In order to align employee incentives with shareholder and lender
              interests, incentive compensation will reward the creation of
              value for the Company. This Plan will tie incentive compensation
              to Economic Value Added ("EVA") and, thereby, reward participants
              for creating value and also "feel" the effect of a reduction in
              value.

       2.     Eligibility
              -----------

              Eligibility for the Plan is limited to regular, full time and part
              time employees (as determined by the Human Resources Policy #250
              Employee Definition) and its wholly owned subsidiaries who have
              worked for the Company for a minimum of 90 days, exclusive of the
              employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement, unless
              such agreement expressly provides otherwise (collectively, the
              "EMPLOYEES" or "PARTICIPANTS"). Newly hired regular, full time or
              part time Employees who meet the criteria for participation are
              eligible to earn their first bonus based upon their EVA Earnings
              (as defined below) from their date of hire through the end of the
              applicable fiscal year, provided they meet the minimum duration of
              employment as stated above. The Plan Administrator shall designate
              the EVA Center for each Employee (which may be determined by
              category, e.g., Employee's job designation). An Employee may be in
              one or more EVA Centers (prorata). The Company's Human Resources
              Department shall maintain the list of EVA Centers.

       3.     Bonus Calculation
              -----------------

       (a)    The bonus earned for Participants during a Plan year will be
              determined based upon the applicable fiscal year's actual EVA of
              the Participant's EVA Center(s). EVA is defined as Net Operating
              Profit After Taxes ("NOPAT") - Capital Charge (see Attachment A).

              A Participant's initial declared bonus (the "EVA BONUS
              DECLARATION" or "BONUS") will be computed as follows:

              EVA
              BONUS  =                EVA  X      TARGET    X    BONUS
              DECLARATION             EARNINGS    BONUS          MULTIPLE

              To better understand how an EVA Bonus will be declared, see the
              example below.
<PAGE>



       (b)    The BONUS MULTIPLE is determined by the EVA achieved for the
              fiscal year ("ACTUAL EVA") compared to the EVA objective for that
              year. The Bonus Multiple is mathematically determined as follows:

              Bonus Multiple = 1 + Actual EVA - Target EVA
                                   -----------------------
                                     EVA Leverage Amount
                                      (the "INTERVAL")

       (c)    The EVA LEVERAGE AMOUNT (also called the "INTERVAL") is the change
              in EVA over and above the Target EVA required to double a bonus
              (i.e., change from a 1.0 to a 2.0 times Bonus Multiple) or the
              shortfall below Target EVA needed to change from a 1.0 to a 0.0
              times Bonus Multiple. The EVA Leverage Amount varies by EVA
              Center, based on the expected volatility of the operating results.

              Expected improvement in EVA and EVA Leverage Amounts are
              determined during the calibration period, normally every two to
              three years or when there is a material change in the Company's
              business or Capital structure, which is determined at the sole
              discretion of the Plan Administrator or with respect to Executive
              Officers, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of
              Directors (the "COMPENSATION COMMITTEE").

       (d)    EVA TARGET BONUS. Eligible Participants will have a Target Bonus
              expressed as a percentage of their earnings in the fiscal year.
              The Target Bonus percentage varies by level of responsibilities
              within the Company. The Human Resources Department maintains the
              list of Employees and their EVA Target Bonus Percentages.

              The Target Bonus for each employee is determined by multiplying
              the Employee's EVA Earnings (defined below) during the fiscal year
              by the Target Bonus percentage.

       (e)    EVA FISCAL YEAR EARNINGS (EVA EARNINGS) are those earnings
              described in Attachment B. Any compensation not listed on
              Attachment B is specifically excluded from EVA Earnings,
              including, without limitation, commissions, relocation payments,
              auto allowances, other fringe benefits and extraordinary payments.
              EVA Earnings exclude EVA Bonus payments under the Plan.

       (f)    EXAMPLE: The following is an example of an EVA Bonus Declaration
              for a fictitious "Employee A":

              EVA Earnings = $35,000
              EVA Target Bonus = 10% of EVA Earnings of $3,500
              EVA Leverage or Interval = $2,000,000
              Target EVA for fiscal 200X = $500,000
              Actual EVA for fiscal 200X = $650,000
              Bonus Multiple =
                             1 + (650,000 - 500,000)
                                 -------------------
                                      2,000,000      = 1.075

              EVA Bonus Declaration =  EVA Earnings x Target Bonus x Bonus
                                       Multiple
                                    =  $35,000 x 10% x 1.075
                                    =  $3,763

       4.     Performance Versus Target
              -------------------------

              The Plan has significant upside, as well as downside performance
              potential. The incentive earnings are based on EVA improvement of
              the Employees' assigned EVA Center(s). If the EVA Center

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

              achieves its Targeted level of EVA improvement, the Employees
              within that EVA Center will achieve their EVA Target Bonus
              Percentage or 1.0 times their Bonus Multiple. If the EVA Center
              exceeds its Targeted level of improvements its Employees will earn
              a multiple greater then 1.0. Conversely, if the EVA Center falls
              below its EVA Target, the Employees will earn a multiple that is
              less than 1.0.

              The Plan is designed to provide the Participants with significant
              upside opportunity, but they also will participate in any dramatic
              negative changes in EVA.

       5.     Bonus Caps and Floor
              --------------------

              In order to protect the Plan Participants from SIGNIFICANT swings
              in performance the Plan is designed with Caps and Floors.
              Generally, the Cap and Floor will vary by EVA Center and Employee
              job classification. The following are the Cap and Floor details
              for the respective business units:

       (a)    ALL SSI EVA CENTERS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CASCADE STEEL (GRADES 9
              AND ABOVE) AND PICK-N-PULL AUTO DISMANTLERS. For Participants with
              a salary grade of 9 or above, EVA Bonus Declarations under the
              Plan will not exceed 3x a Participant's EVA Target Bonus (the
              "CAP"), in other words, 300% of Target Bonus and in the event of
              negative performance, will not be more than - 1.0x a Participant's
              EVA Target Bonus (the "FLOOR"), being negative 100% of Target
              Bonus. The Cap and Floor only limit the annual EVA Bonus
              Declaration, but do not limit the Target EVA for the succeeding
              year.

              Earnings cannot be taken away; however, it is possible to earn a
              "negative bonus". A negative bonus will result if the actual EVA
              in any year falls DRAMATICALLY short of the EVA Target. In this
              case, the negative bonus would be applied to the EVA Bonus Bank,
              if applicable. See the discussion below regarding the EVA Bonus
              Bank.

              Participants with a salary grade of 8 and below and/or hourly,
              will not participate in the EVA Bonus Bank and therefore will not
              be subject to a negative Bonus. In exchange, the Bonus Multiple
              for these Participants will not exceed 2.0. The amount of any
              positive Bonus shall be paid in cash (net of withholdings) to
              these Participants on the applicable Payment Date.

       (b)    CASCADE STEEL. Due to the Company's announcement in May 2004 that
              it would explore options with respect to Cascade Steel, it was
              determined by Cascade Steel's senior management team that the
              Cascade Steel Plan Participants who are Grade 9 and above will not
              be subject to a Cap or Floor. Thus, they have unlimited upside and
              downside.

              Cascade Steel Participants with a salary grade of 8 and below
              and/or hourly will not participate in the EVA Bonus Bank and
              therefore will not be subject to a negative bonus. In exchange,
              the Bonus Multiple for these Participants will not exceed 2.0. The
              amount of any positive Bonus shall be paid in cash (net of
              withholdings) to these Participants on the applicable Payment
              Date.

       6.     Payment of Bonus and EVA Bonus Bank (Grades 9 and Above)
              --------------------------------------------------------

              The amount of any positive Bonus shall be paid in cash (net of
              withholdings) to the Participant, subject to a banking system of
              two thirds of the amount in excess of the Annual EVA Target Bonus.
              The total Bonus PAYMENT (each an "INDIVIDUAL AWARD") for each Plan
              year will be determined as follows:


                    BEGINNING YEAR BANK BALANCE
              +     EVA BONUS DECLARED
              =     AVAILABLE BANK BALANCE

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

              -     PAYOUT UP TO 100% OF ANNUAL EVA TARGET BONUS TO PARTICIPANT
              =     BONUS BANK BALANCE AVAILABLE TO BE PAID IN CURRENT YEAR
              -     CURRENT YEAR BANK PAYOUT EQUAL TO 33 1/3% OF ANY BANK
                    BALANCE AVAILABLE

              =     ENDING  YEAR BANK BALANCE

              The banking of Bonuses serves to smooth Bonus payouts over the
              business cycle. This banking system also ensures that performance
              is sustained by making the payout of bank balances contingent on
              sustained performance, through the formula outlined above.

              The payment will be made (net of withholding) shortly after the
              Company's fourth quarter earnings release, for each Plan year,
              after all financial statement audits are completed (each a
              "PAYMENT DATE").

              The Bonus Bank balance, if any, is not separately funded or set
              aside like a 401(k) Plan and/or Pension Plan and remains an asset
              of the Company, subject to the rights of general creditors.
              Further, it is not adjusted for interest or investment gains and
              losses.

       7.     Negative Bonus Bank (Grades 9 and Above)
              ----------------------------------------

              As previously mentioned, the Plan subjects certain Participants to
              risks that can result in both significantly higher Bonus payouts
              than the EVA Target Bonus, but can also cause Bonus declarations
              to be negative. A Negative Bonus Declaration can cause a
              Participant's Bonus Bank to be negative entering a new Plan year.
              In this circumstance any negative Bonus Bank must be repaid as
              follows: In a year a "positive" EVA Bonus Declaration is made, 50
              cents of every dollar of such EVA Bonus will be used, first to
              repay the negative Bonus Bank amount until the Bonus Bank balance
              is at zero, and the balance of the EVA Bonus will be paid (and a
              portion may be placed in the Bonus Bank as provided in paragraph
              A. 6 above) to the Participant on the applicable Payment Date.

              EXAMPLE:

              Fictitious "Employee A's" EVA Earnings = $35,000
              EVA Target Bonus % = 10%

              Beginning Bonus Bank Balance                              ($3,500)
              Current year Bonus Multiple = .50x
              EVA Bonus Declaration = $1,750
                  Repay the negative Bonus Bank
                  Balance $.50 per $1.00                         875
                                                             -------
              Ending Year Bonus Bank Balance                 ($2,628)

              Individual Award paid in current year                        $875

B.     Administration and Guidelines of the Plan
       -----------------------------------------

              Administration of the Plan is at the sole discretion of the
              Company's Chief Executive Officer (the "PLAN ADMINISTRATOR")
              except with respect to the Company's Executive Officers, for whom
              the Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of
              the Company's Board of Directors. The Plan Administrator shall
              establish the EVA Centers. Guidelines for EVA adjustments and the
              "capitalization" of certain items will be maintained by the
              Company's Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO"). The Plan may be
              amended in whole or in part from time to time, or terminated in
              its entirety by the Plan Administrator or the

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

              Board of Directors, provided that no such amendment or termination
              shall adversely affect any positive balance then remaining in a
              Participant's Bonus Bank. Guidelines for the Plan's administration
              are:

       1.     Duration of the Current Plan Provisions
              ---------------------------------------

              It is anticipated that the EVA Bonus Plan will endure long into
              the future. However, the current provisions in the Plan have been
              set and are not anticipated to change, except in the unusual
              circumstances that include a significant change in the Company's
              business operations and/or a material change in capital structure.
              It is anticipated that every two to three years, the Plan's
              provisions will be reviewed and key factors MAY be recalibrated.

       2.     Individual Awards
              -----------------

              Individual Awards for exempt and non-exempt eligible Participants
              shall be based on the EVA Earnings (as defined in Attachment B) of
              each Participant during the applicable fiscal year.

       3.     Determination of EVA Improvement Factors/Targets
              ------------------------------------------------

              The EVA Targets for each EVA Center will be objectively calculated
              based upon its prior year's actual EVA, plus an improvement
              factor, which is determined as part of the Plan's recalibration. A
              summary of each EVA Center's improvement factors will be
              maintained by the CFO and will be reviewed during the
              recalibration periods.

       4.     Determination of Bonus Awards
              -----------------------------

              The CFO will compute each EVA Center's EVA for the fiscal year and
              present it for approval by the Plan Administrator.

       5.     New Hires/Promotions
              --------------------

              An individual who is hired/promoted into a position that
              participates in the EVA Bonus Plan may be eligible for a Bonus
              award so long as he/she has been employed full or part time for 90
              consecutive days. (see Eligibility on page 1). The EVA Bonus will
              be based upon the EVA Earnings from the date of hire/promotion to
              the end of the fiscal year.

              Mid-year promotions that change the Employee's EVA Target Bonus
              and/or EVA Center will be weighted based on the number of days at
              each EVA Target Bonus level and/or days in each EVA Center.

       6.     Transfers
              ---------

              A Participant who transfers his or her employment from one EVA
              Center to another shall have his or her EVA Bonus Bank transferred
              to the new EVA Center. For the year in which the transfer occurs,
              the Participant will have his or her EVA Bonus Declaration
              weighted based on the time spent in each particular EVA Center The
              Participant's weighted average EVA Bonus Multiple will be based on
              each EVA Center's full year EVA performance, prorated based upon
              the period the Participant was employed in each EVA Center.

       7.     Death or Disability
              -------------------

              A Participant who dies or becomes permanently disabled, as defined
              by the Company's disability policy, while in the employment of the
              Company, shall receive full payment of his or her positive Bonus
              Bank Balance, if any, after the EVA Bonus payment for the year in
              which he or she dies or becomes permanently disabled has been
              calculated, together with his or her pro-rata share of the

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

              current year's EVA Bonus Declaration (to the extent it results in
              a positive number). In the event of death, the payment will be
              made to the Employee's estate. Such payments shall be made on the
              Payment Date in respect to the Plan year in which such death or
              disability occurs.

       8.     Retirement
              ----------

              A Participant who retires from the Company shall receive full
              payment of his or her positive Bonus Bank Balance, if any, that
              remains after the calculation of the Participant's EVA Bonus
              Declaration for the fiscal year in which such retirement occurs,
              together with his or her pro-rata share of the current year's EVA
              Bonus Declaration (to the extent it results in a positive number).
              The payment of the Bonus Bank, if any, will be made in a lump sum
              on the Payment Date in respect of the Plan year in which such
              retirement occurs. Negative Ending Bonus Bank Balances are waived.
              For the purposes of this paragraph 8, a person who is at least age
              55 is deemed to be "retired" when he/she would receive retirement
              benefits under his or her retirement pension plan, if any.

       9.     Involuntary Termination without Cause
              -------------------------------------

              A Participant who is involuntarily terminated without cause will
              receive full payment of his or her Bonus Bank Balance on the
              Payment Date next following the Employee's date of termination.
              Negative Ending Bonus Bank Balances are waived.

       10.    Voluntary Resignation or Termination with Cause
              -----------------------------------------------

              Except as expressly provided above, voluntary termination of
              employment or termination with cause (as determined by the Plan
              Administrator or the Compensation Committee, as applicable) shall
              result in forfeiture of the Participant's Bonus Bank Balance and
              any EVA Bonus Declaration for the fiscal year in which voluntary
              resignation or termination with cause occurs.

       11.    General Provisions
              ------------------

       (a)    Withholding of Taxes. The Company shall have the right to withhold
              the amount of taxes, which it determines is required to be
              withheld under law with respect to any amount payable under this
              Plan.

       (b)    Expenses. All expenses and costs in connection with the adoption
              and administration of the Plan shall be borne by the Company.

       (c)    No Prior Right or Offer. Except and until expressly granted
              pursuant to the Plan, nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to give
              any Employee any contractual or other right to participate in the
              benefits of the Plan. No award to any such Participant in any Plan
              period shall be deemed to create a right to receive any award or
              to participate in the benefits of the Plan in any subsequent Plan
              Period.

       12.    Limitations
              -----------

       (a)    No Continued Employment. Neither the establishment of the Plan or

              express or implied contract of employment with any Participant for
              any period of time, or change an Employee's "at will" status, or
              in any way abridge the rights of the Company to determine the
              terms and conditions of employment or to terminate the employment
              of any Employee with or without cause, at any time.

       (b)    Not Part of Other Benefits. The benefits provided in this Plan
              shall not be deemed a part of any other benefit provided by the

                                 GUIDELINES FOR:
                         AMENDMENTS TO EVA TARGET LEVELS
                       AND THE CAPITALIZATION OF EXPENSES

                   AMENDMENT TO EVA TARGET PERFORMANCE LEVELS
                   ------------------------------------------

The EVA performance Targets established under the EVA Bonus Plan is intended to
achieve long term improvements in shareholder value. These Targets have been
objectively determined based on investors' expectations of the Company's
returns. Changes to these Targets are expected to be infrequent, but are likely
to change upon the recalibration of the Plan or upon a major acquisition or
divestiture by the Company. It is expected that the Plan will be recalibrated
every two to three years. Nonetheless, situations will arise in which it is
appropriate to revise such objectives.

                           CAPITALIZATION OF EXPENSES
                           --------------------------

Similarly, certain "significant" expenses, losses, income and gains should not
be considered normal due to their unusual nature. Under EVA theory certain of
these expenses should be "capitalized" so that they do not distort operating
results calculated under EVA in any given year. These items are to be added to
the capital base of the EVA Center and thus required to earn a return as long as
these capitalized expenses remain a part of the capital base. A capitalized
expense (a "CAPITAL CHARGE") would usually have one or more of the following
criteria:

     o    Material to the Company
     o    Unusual
     o    Nonrecurring in the foreseeable future
     o    Result in tangible, measurable, long-term benefit to the business.

     Some examples of significant unusual income and expense items that MIGHT be
     capitalized are as follows:

     o    Significant shut-down expenses related to consolidation of operating
          units following an acquisition
     o    Expenses related to a Plant closing. The shut-down is expected to lead
          to improved operating profits
     o    (Gains)/Losses on the disposal of equipment
     o    Income received from a legal settlement (e.g., electrode price fixing
          settlement)
     o    Significant, legacy environmental issues that are the result of
          changes in law or government focus

     Some examples of costs that should NOT be capitalized are as follows:

     o    Ongoing environmental prevention and "normal" remediation costs
          associated with the business
     o    Losses resulting from holding inventory or decreases in market prices
     o    New revenue sources (e.g., power sales, adding a new product line like
          dock activity, etc.)
     o    Employee severance costs resulting from terminations and
          hiring/relocation expenses

The CFO will review all requests for capitalization of expenses, which should be
submitted prior to incurring the costs or expenses, where practical. Any
revisions to EVA calculations are at the discretion of the Plan Administrator
and/or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be.

                                 EVA ADJUSTMENTS
                                 ---------------

In order to calculate EVA in a manner that is consistent with the underlying
economics of the business and to properly align management motivations with
investor expectations, the Company will make certain adjustments to

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

the "normal' financial statements that are produced for external reporting. As
part of the implementation of EVA, a cross functional team of managers from
across the Company analyzed potential adjustments that could be made. Based upon
this analysis the following EVA adjustments will be made on a monthly basis to
calculate EVA:


A. NOPAT (NET OPERATING PROFITS AFTER TAXES) IS CALCULATED AS NET INCOME, WHICH
INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS:

1.     Interest expense is added back to NOPAT.
2.     The interest component of operating lease expense is added back to NOPAT.
       The interest component of operating lease expense is calculated as
       capitalized operating leases x cost of borrowing.
3.     Income resulting from non-operating items (capitalized bond fees at CSRM,
       benefit plan assets, certain non-operating notes) is excluded from the
       calculations.
4.     The after-tax amount of non-recurring expense (income) is excluded from
       NOPAT calculations, but added to (subtracted from) Capital.
5.     Increase in the bad debt reserve is added back to NOPAT.
6.     Increase in the valuation reserves is added back to NOPAT. No such
       adjustment is required for the scrap inventory.
7.     Amortization of goodwill is added back to NOPAT.
8.     Expenses from strategic investments may be capitalized into a suspense
       account and brought in to the EVA calculations over time if approved in
       advance by the steering committee with a specified schedule.
9.     Economic taxes are calculated by applying economic tax
10.    Delinquent customer advances are amortized as a NOPAT expense over a
       limited, defined period.


B. CAPITAL IS CALCULATED AS TOTAL ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS:

1.     Non-interest bearing current liabilities (accounts payable, accrued
       payroll liabilities, etc.) are subtracted from Capital, but current
       portion of environmental liability is not treated as a non-interest
       bearing current liability.
2.     Capitalized operating leases are added to Capital.
3.     Non-operating items are removed from Capital.
4.     The after-tax amount of non-recurring expense (income) is added to
       (subtracted from) Capital.
5.     Accounts receivable is grossed up to include the bad debt reserve.
6.     Inventory is grossed up to include any valuation reserves.
7.     Goodwill is grossed up to include accumulated amortization.
8.     Capital from strategic investments may be capitalized into a suspense
       account and brought in to the EVA calculations over time if approved in
       advance by the Plan Administrator with a specified schedule.
9.     Cumulative difference between the cash tax paid by Schnitzer Steel and
       the economic tax is added to Capital.
10.    Delinquent customer advances are amortized over a limited, defined
       period.


The Company will continue to review the list of adjustments and consider changes
or additions to the list of adjustments as part of the Plan's calibration.

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

     have:

     (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared,

     (b)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls

     (c)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
          likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
          financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board
     of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
