                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  Business

         Glen Burnie Bancorp (the "Company") is a bank holding company organized
in 1990 under the laws of the State of Maryland and located in Anne Arundel
County, Maryland. It presently owns all outstanding shares of capital stock of
The Bank of Glen Burnie (the "Bank"), a federally-insured commercial bank
organized in 1949 under the laws of the State of Maryland, basically serving
Anne Arundel County and surrounding areas. The Bank is engaged in the commercial
and retail banking business as authorized by the banking statutes of the State
of Maryland, including the receiving of demand and time deposits, and the making
of loans to individuals, associations, partnerships and corporations. Real
estate financing consists of residential first and second mortgage loans, home
equity lines of credit and commercial mortgage loans. Commercial lending
consists of both secured and unsecured loans.

Deposits and Loans

         The Bank's deposit products include regular savings accounts
(statements), money market deposit accounts, demand deposit accounts, NOW
checking accounts, IRA accounts and certificates of deposit accounts. Variations
in service charges, terms and interest rates are used to target specific
markets.

         Retail loan products including mortgage loans, personal loans, consumer
loans, overdraft protection, and loans secured by deposit accounts.

         Ancillary products and services include safe deposit boxes, money
orders and travellers checks, night depositories, ACH transactions, wire
transfers, automated teller machines, telephone banking, and a customer call
center.

         The Bank actively solicits loan applications from small to medium size
businesses. The Bank believes that this is a market in which a relatively small
community bank has a competitive advantage in personal service and flexibility.

         The funds needed by the Bank to make loans are generated by deposit
accounts maintained at the Bank. Total deposits at the Bank were $232,745,975 as
of December 31, 1996. In addition, the Bank may borrow up to $26 million under a
line of credit from The Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. As of December 31,
1996, the Bank's "Tier 1" capital (consisting of stockholders' equity, excluding
unrealized after tax net gain or loss on investment securities available for
sale) was $18,321,565. Its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets (12.9%
as of December 31, 1996), total capital to risk-based assets (13.5% as of


                                        2

<PAGE>


December 31, 1996) and leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets
(6.6% as of December 31, 1996) exceed the minimum ratios required by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").

Memorandum of Understanding

         In the Fall of 1995, the FDIC and the Maryland State Bank Commissioner
(the "Commissioner") performed a routine examination of the Bank. Following the
examination, the Bank, the FDIC and the Commissioner entered into a Memorandum
of Understanding ("M.O.U.") effective June 13, 1996. The M.O.U. required the
Bank to establish written programs to reduce classified assets and contingent
liabilities and to report to the FDIC and the Commissioner quarterly on the
status of such assets and liabilities, to collect or charge-off certain
classified loans, to maintain ratios relating to capital and to delinquent and
non-accrued loans, to provide the FDIC and the Commissioner with thirty days
notice prior to dividend payments, to develop an internal loan review and
grading system, policies for loan underwriting and administration, a strategic
plan for improving operations and budgets, and policies and monitoring systems
for liquidity and interest rate risk, to evaluate the allowance for loan and
lease losses quarterly, to engage a chief lending officer, to cease any
violations of law or regulations cited by the FDIC or the Commissioner, and to
establish a committee of three directors to monitor compliance with the M.O.U.
The Bank is in the process of finalizing the systems and policies required under
the M.O.U., is continuing with the required periodic monitoring and notice
requirements, and has completed the other requirements under the M.O.U.

         Should the Bank fail to comply with the provisions of the M.O.U., the
FDIC or the Commissioner could assert greater control over the Bank's operations
and impose penalties. Enforcement actions may include the issuance of formal and
informal agreements, the imposition of civil money penalties and the issuance of
a cease-and-desist order that can be judicially enforced. Neither the FDIC nor
the Commissioner has sought to initiate any such measures.

Recent Loan Loss Experience Involving Significant Borrowers

         During its 1995 fiscal year, the Bank had outstanding loans to Brian
Davis, Oceanic Ltd., Inc. ("Oceanic"), McCafferty's Restaurant ("McCafferty's")
and other entities affiliated with Mr. Davis aggregating approximately
$5,804,000 (equalling approximately 28% of the Company's and its subsidiaries'
consolidated revenues for such fiscal year). The Bank filed suit to recover
amounts due under the Oceanic loans, alleging that documents evidencing security
interests for many of the Oceanic loans were falsified by or on behalf of the
borrower. Mr. Davis, Oceanic and McCafferty's have all filed bankruptcy


                                        3

<PAGE>


proceedings and significant recovery by the Bank is unlikely. As a result of the
foregoing, approximately $4,533,000 of these loans have been charged-off.
McCafferty's has brought a proceeding against the Bank seeking damages in
connection with loans involving McCafferty's. See "Legal Proceedings."

         An equipment and automobile leasing company and its affiliates had
approximately $8,610,000 in outstanding loans and leases during the Bank's 1995
fiscal year (equalling about 42% of the Company's and its subsidiaries'
consolidated revenues for such fiscal year). The Bank has ceased approving new
loans for these customers due to concerns about the quality of certain of the
loans and leases. As of December 31, 1996 the aggregate outstanding balance of
all loans and leases to these customers was approximately $6,218,000.

         The Bank does not believe that the loss of these customers has
materially adversely affected its loan generation business, although the
charge-offs in connection therewith adversely affected its 1995 net income and
earnings per share. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation."

         Certain other customers hold secured commercial real estate loans. The
outstanding principal amount of some of these loans exceeds ten percent (10%) of
the consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries; however, the
required annual debt service payments under each such loan does not exceed ten
percent (10%) of the Company's consolidated revenues. The Company does not
believe that the retirement of these loans or loss of such business, should it
occur for any reason, would have a material adverse effect on the Bank's
business.

Strategic Plan

         In order to enhance its business and resolve certain of the problems it
has faced as described above and pursuant to the M.O.U., the Bank has adopted a
strategic plan (the "Strategic Plan"). The objectives of the Strategic Plan are
to increase returns on average assets and average equity to set percentages
within set time frames, improve the Bank's efficiency ratio (non-interest
expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income),
decrease delinquent loans and classified assets as a percentage of total loans
within set time periods, increase the ratio of total loans to total assets
within a set time period while maintaining and improving asset quality, increase
total deposits to a set amount within a set time period, build capital to a set
percentage of assets within set time periods while continuing to make dividend
payments, maintain regulatory compliance and improve effectiveness of corporate


                                        4

<PAGE>


structure and communications. The Strategic Plan establishes strategies and
action plans to enable the Company to meet these objectives. It is subject to
review by the FDIC and the Commissioner.

Competition

         The Bank faces competition from other community banks and financial
institutions and larger intrastate and interstate banks and financial
institutions (currently, twelve financial institutions operate within two miles
of the Bank's headquarters). The Bank's interest rates, loan and deposit terms,
and offered products and services are governed, to a large extent, by such
competition. The Bank attempts to provide superior service within its community
and to know and facilitate its customers. It seeks commercial relationships with
small to medium size businesses who, it believes, would welcome personal service
and flexibility. While the Company believes it is the sixth largest deposit
holder in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, with an estimated 5.63% market share as
of June 1995 (the latest date for which the Bank has relevant data available),
it believes its greatest competition comes from smaller community banks which
offer similar personalized services.

Federal and State Regulation

         The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to regulation under
the Bank Holding Company Act and is registered with and subject to the
supervision of the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to Federal Reserve Board
regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. The Company is
required to furnish to the Federal Reserve Board annual and quarterly reports of
its operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may
require, and is subject to regular inspection by Federal Reserve Board
examiners.

         Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Company may not engage in any
business other than managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its
subsidiaries, except that it may engage in certain activities which, in the
opinion of the Federal Reserve Board, are so closely related to banking or to
managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Company is
also prohibited, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect
ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company unless
the company is engaged in such permitted activities. The Bank Holding Company
Act also prohibits a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries from
acquiring voting shares or substantially all the assets of any bank holding
company or bank, or from merging or consolidating with any other bank holding
company, unless such acquisition is approved by the Federal Reserve Board. Under
Maryland law, a 


                                        5

<PAGE>


bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any bank if, as a
result of such acquisition, the bank holding company would control more than 30%
of the total deposits of all depository institutions in the State of Maryland
unless such limit is waived by the Commissioner.

         The Federal Reserve Board has adopted guidelines regarding the capital
adequacy of bank holding companies, which require bank holding companies to
maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to
risk-weighted assets. The Federal Reserve Board has also issued a policy
statement expressing its view that a bank holding company should pay cash
dividends only to the extent that the company's net income for the past year is
sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that
is consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality and overall
financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit a bank
holding company from paying dividends if it deems such payment to constitute an
unsafe or unsound practice.

         The Company's primary source of income is the receipt of dividends from
its subsidiaries. The Bank's ability to make such payments to the Company is
subject to certain statutory and regulatory restrictions. Under Maryland law,
Maryland banks may only pay dividends from undivided profits or, with the prior
approval of the Commissioner, their surplus in excess of 100% of required
capital stock. Every Maryland bank is prohibited from declaring dividends on its
shares of common stock in excess of 90% of net earnings unless its surplus fund
equals the amount of required capital stock. In addition, the Bank is prohibited
by Federal statute from paying dividends or making other capital distributions
that would cause the Bank to fail to meet its regulatory capital requirements.
The FDIC also has the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends if it
determines such payments to constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.

         Banks are extensively regulated under both Federal and state law. The
Bank, as a Maryland state chartered bank, is subject to primary supervision,
periodic examination and regulation by the Commissioner and the FDIC. Although
the Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is nevertheless
subject to certain regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. State and Federal
statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the Bank's operations,
including reserves against deposits, loans, investments, transactions with
affiliates, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends and locations of
branch offices. The FDIC and the Commissioner regularly examine the operations
of the Bank, which must file quarterly and annual reports with such agencies.
Such requirements are intended for the protection of the Bank's depositors and
not its stockholders.


                                        6

<PAGE>

         The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements
administered by Federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum
capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that, if
undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank's financial
statements. The Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve
quantitative measures of the Bank's assets, liabilities, and certain off-
balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting principles. The
Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative
judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other
factors.

         As of December 31, 1996, the most recent notification from the FDIC
categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for
prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must
maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based and Tier I leverage ratios.
There are no conditions or events since that notification that the Bank believes
have changed the institution's category, although there can be no assurance that
the Bank will continue to meet the minimum ratios necessary to maintain such
categorization.

         The Company believes that it and the Bank are both currently in
substantial compliance with all applicable Federal and state regulations.

Interest that would have been accrued under the terms of these loans was
$191,200 for the year ended December 31, 1995.

Loans are placed on non-accrual being 90 days delinquent, however, real estate
loans were considered on a case-by-case basis subject to collateral. 

The bank identified impaired loans of $407,597 as of December 31, 1995. No
specific allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans was provided.

These loans were identified as impaired near the end of 1995, and no payments
were received on these loans in 1995 after they were classified impaired. 

There were no concentrations of credit not previously disclosed. The allowance
for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged
to expense. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when
management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely.

The allowance, based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior
loan loss experience, is an amount that management believes will be adequate to
absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible.

The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes
in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality,
review of specific problem loans, and current economic conditions and trends
that may affect the borrowers' ability to pay.

Other Activities

         The Company also owns all outstanding shares of capital stock of GBB
Properties, Inc. ("GBB") another Maryland corporation organized in 1994 which is
engaged in the business of acquiring, holding and disposing of real property,
typically acquired in connection with foreclosure proceedings (or deed in lieu
of foreclosure) instituted by the Bank or acquired in connection with branch
expansions by the Bank. No branch expansion occurred in 1995.

Employees

         The Bank currently employs 143 people. Neither the Company nor GBB
currently has any employees.

ITEM 2.  Properties

         The Bank owns its Banking Operations Center, its Executive Offices, its
main banking facility in Glen Burnie, and four (4) branch offices in various
communities in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, all of which are unencumbered. The
Company owns no real estate at present. GBB currently owns two parcels of real
estate obtained from foreclosures by the Bank. The book value of these
properties is $285,700. One is a residential property which can be used for
certain commercial purposes; GBB has contracted to sell it for $155,000 ($25,500
over its book value). The other consists of office condominiums. GBB also
intends to sell this property. The Bank also owns foreclosed real estate having
a book value of $143,000. It consists of residential property which the Bank is
holding for sale.

ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings

         McCafferty's has commenced an adversary proceeding against the Bank
(McCafferty's , Inc. v. Bank of Glen Burnie Adversary Case, Case No.
96-5137-ESD, U.S. Bankr. Ct., D. Md.) on March 20, 1996 in McCafferty's pending
Chapter 11 bankruptcy case (In re McCafferty's, Inc., Case No. 96-5-2444-SD,
U.S. Bankr. Ct., D. Md.). McCafferty's seeks $5,000,000 in compensatory damages
and $50,000,000 in punitive damages. It alleges that the Bank acted in concert
with Brian Davis, who was McCafferty's treasurer and chief financial officer, in
an unspecified manner to defraud McCafferty's, that the Bank has accepted loan
payments from McCafferty's for loans which McCafferty's never signed nor
authorized, and that the Bank failed to make a loan it had promised to
McCafferty's. The Bank denies any liability and intends to continue contesting
the litigation vigorously. The Company does not believe that the outcome of this
litigation will have a material adverse effect on its business.

         The Bank is involved in various other legal actions relating to its
business activities. These actions all involve claims for money damages which in
the aggregate do not exceed 10% of the Company's consolidated assets. The
Company does not believe that any ultimate liability or risk of loss with
respect to those actions will materially affect its consolidated financial
position.

ITEM 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.


         The Company did not submit any matters to a vote of its security
holders during the fourth quarter of its 1995 fiscal year. However, at its
annual stockholders' meeting on March 9, 1995, two slates of candidates ran for
election as directors. The winners received the following votes (rounded to the
nearest share):

         Shirley Boyer                                        448,313
         John E. Demyan                                       448,452
         Susan Demyan                                         448,452
         Richard A. Fine                                      448,452
         F. William Kuethe, Jr.                               448,452
         Frederick W. Kuethe, III                             448,452
         William N. Scherer, Sr.                              448,452
         Karen B. Thorwarth                                   443,315
         Neil C. Williams                                     443,315

The candidates on the losing slate received the following votes (rounded to the
nearest share):

         Theodore L. Bertier, Jr.                             287,508
         Jan W. Clark                                         248,830
         John E. DeGrange, Sr.                                248,830
         F. Ward DeGrange, Sr.                                198,044
         Louis J. Doetsch                                     246,653
         F. Paul Dorr, Jr.                                    246,653
         Carl L. Hein, Jr.                                    248,830
         Henry L. Hein                                        248,830
         Earl G. Walter                                       248,830
         Katherine P. Wellford                                246,653

Mary Lou Wilcox ran as an independent candidate, losing with 45,735 votes. The
elected directors represented a change from a majority of the directors
(including the Company's chief executive officer) previously in position.

         Prior to the election, the directors who ultimately lost the election
filed a lawsuit in the name of the Company against a number of the candidates
who ultimately won the election. The suit was settled shortly after the
election, with the election results accepted by all parties in interest. (The
settlement did not terminate any solicitation conducted with respect to the
election.) The Company agreed to pay all legal fees in connection with the case.
No wrongdoing was found on the part of any director or candidate.

         At the March 9, 1995 annual meeting the stockholders also approved the
selection of Rowles & Company as independent accountants for the Company and its
subsidiaries for its 1995 fiscal year. All shares voting voted in favor of such
appointment.

Item 5.           Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related
                  Stockholder Matters

         The Company's common equity consists of one class of common stock, par
value $10.00 per share. The Company effectuated a six for five stock split on
January 3, 1996. The Company's stock is traded in the over-the-counter market
and quoted in the pink sheets. The actual range of high and low bid quotations
for the common stock, which has been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the
stock split, for each full quarterly period during 1994 and 1995, based on
actual settlements reported by Legg Mason Wood Walker, the only source of such
information available to the Company, are as follows:

information of actual settlements reported by Legg Mason Wood Walker, the
reported high and low were $26.00.

         As of December 31, 1996, the number of record holders of the Company's
common stock was 488.

         Since its inception, the Company has paid quarterly cash dividends on
its common stock, except that certain dividends have been paid in stock, rather
than cash, to stockholders who participated in the Company's Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. The per share dividends paid in cash
during 1994 and 1995, giving retroactive effect to the stock split, were as
follows:

         Pursuant to its Strategic Plan, the Company intends to pay dividends
equal to forty percent (40%) of its profits for each quarter. However, dividends
remain subject to declaration by the board of directors in its sole discretion
and there can be no assurance that the Company will be legally or financially
able to make such payments. Payment of dividends may be limited by Federal and
state regulations which impose general restrictions on a bank's and bank holding
company's right to pay dividends (and to make loans or advances to affiliates
which could be used to pay dividends). See "Business."

ITEM 6.  Selected Financial Data.

         The following chart presents consolidated selected financial data for
the Company and its subsidiaries for each of the fiscal years from and including
1992, during which the Company acquired the outstanding capital stock of the
Bank, and for the Bank's 1991 fiscal year. All amounts are expressed in
thousands of dollars except per share amounts. Adjustments in dividends and
earnings per share have been made to give retroactive effect to stock splits.

ITEM 7.           Management's Discussion And Analysis Of
                  Financial Condition And Results Of Operation.

Results Of Operation

         In 1995, the Bank reported a net loss of ($1,678,941) as compared to
1994 net income of $3,516,593. The loss was primarily a result of loan losses
related to several large, uncollectible loans. Non-recurring litigation and
restructuring costs in 1995 totalled $1,407,641. Total assets grew 5.7% in 1995
with most of this growth in investment securities while gross loans declined by
1.5%. A 6% growth in deposits in 1995 accounted for the growth in assets.

         The Company and its subsidiaries had a consolidated net loss of
$1,726,748 ($2.01 per share) for 1995, a significant change from their 1994
consolidated net income of $3,516,593 ($4.22 per share) and their 1993
consolidated net income of $3,047,112 ($3.69 per share). The change is primarily
due to a significant increase in the provision for loan losses of $7,925,000 for
1995 compared to $1,120,000 for 1994 and $1,080,000 for 1993. The increase
resulted from provisions being made to charge-off delinquent and non-performing
loans. The collectibility of certain loans, significant in aggregate amount,
became doubtful during 1995 and the Bank charged-off a significant amount of
such loans in 1996. The basic terms of the M.O.U. and possible sanctions should
the Bank fail to adhere to it, and certain specific problem loans, are described
under "Business."

         The consolidated net interest income prior to making provision for
credit losses decreased by $528,822 (4.5%) from $11,867,959 in 1994 to
$11,339,137 in 1995. Net interest income had increased by $1,131,865 (10.5%)
from $10,736,094 in 1993. The 1995 decrease is primarily due to an increase in
interest expense on deposits which exceeded a slight increase in total interest
revenues from lending activities for such period. The movement of deposits from
lower yielding savings and money market accounts to higher yielding certificates
of deposit resulted in an increase in the Bank's cost of deposits during 1995.
In addition, the Bank wrote off approximately $220,000 in interest income during
1995 in connection with its charge-off of certain loans as described above.

         Increased expenses of the Company and its subsidiaries in 1995 also
resulted from $1,407,641 in litigation costs and costs relating to the 1995
directors' election contest. The Bank has obtained insurance reimbursement for
approximately $560,000 of this amount and does not expect to have such charges
(other than routine litigation costs) in the future.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

         Total deposits increased from $208,565,653 at 1994 year end to
$221,120,763 at the end of 1995, an increase of $12,555,110 (6.0%). Total
deposits increased by $5,654,923 (2.8%) during 1994 from $202,910,730 at the end
of 1993. While deposits have increased over the past two years, the Bank
believes that a general downward trend in interest rates paid on deposit
accounts has resulted in a trend away from lower yielding deposit products
toward higher yielding long term deposits.

         NOW accounts have remained relatively flat increasing by $472,703 in
1994 and $17,141 in 1995 from $21,800,005 at year end 1993. Over the same
period, savings deposits after increasing slightly in 1994 from $52,764,881 in
1993 to $52,830,352 in 1994, declined to $46,752,665 at the end of 1995, a
decrease of $6,077,687 (11.5%). Meanwhile, both certificates of deposit over
$100,000 and other time deposits (made up of certificates of deposit less than
$100,000 and individual retirement accounts) increased by $2,040,197 (26.1%) and
$17,788,337 (34.4%), respectively in 1995. In 1994 certificates of deposit over
$100,000 increased by $1,274,178 (19.5%) from $6,530,466 in 1993 and other time
deposits increased by $4,250,550 (9.0%) from $47,445,457 in 1993.

         The Bank's cash and cash equivalents (cash plus federal funds sold) as
of December 31, 1995 ($9,450,021) was roughly the same as at December 31, 1994
($9,606,316), which, in turn, was only 66.5% of the December 31, 1993 total of
$14,435,017. The aggregate market value of investment securities held by the
Bank as of December 31, 1995 was $74,690,073, compared to $59,024,129 as of
December 31, 1994, a $15,665,944 (26.5%) increase. The reason for the large
increase in investment securities during 1995 was the 6.0% increase in deposits
coupled with declining loan demand. The market value of the Bank's investment
securities as of December 31, 1994 had decreased by $2,436,148 (4.1%) from their
December 31, 1993 total.


                                       18

<PAGE>


         The Bank may draw on a $26,000,000 line of credit from The Federal Home
Loan Bank of Atlanta. As of December 31, 1994 $1,500,000 was outstanding under
this line. No amounts were outstanding at the end of either 1995 or 1993.

         The Bank's net loans decreased by $3,342,654 (2.2%) from $153,814,422
in 1994 to $150,471,768 in 1995. The 1994 net loan total increased by
$11,948,629 (8.4%) from $141,865,793 in 1993. The variations are largely due to
an increase in construction and land development loans in 1994 followed by a
reduction in such loans in 1995. Residential and commercial mortgage loans
increased during 1995 whereas lease financings and installment loans decreased.
The Bank has determined to decrease its equipment and automobile lease based
lending because of the difficulties in monitoring the financial condition of the
clients of lease company borrowers.

ITEM 8.  Financial Statements And Supplementary Data.

         The response to this Item is set forth at the end of this report.

ITEM 9.  Changes In And Disagreements With Accountants On
          Accounting And Financial Disclosure.

         On April 11, 1996 the Company's board of directors decided not to
reengage Rowles & Company to review the Company's consolidated financial
statements for its 1996 fiscal year. Such accountants report on the Company's
consolidated financial statements for each of its prior two fiscal years did not
contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or
modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. There were no
disagreements between the Company and Rowles & Company. On June 27, 1996, the
Company's board of directors decided to engage Trice & Geary LLC to perform such
function and Trice & Geary LLC was so engaged on August 16, 1996.

Pension Plan Information

         The Bank maintains a pension plan for substantially all employees
pursuant to which benefits are based on the employee's average rate of earnings
and years of service. A participant's pension is based on the average amount of
his annual earnings for his five most highly paid consecutive years during the
ten years immediately preceding his retirement. His pension is determined by
multiplying 2% of the "covered" portion of this amount and .65% of any
additional portion by the lesser of the number of his years of service or 20.
The "covered" portion is his social security taxable wage basis taken over a
period of up to 35 years. The following table shows the estimated annual
benefits payable upon retirement in specified compensation and years of service
classifications based on the assumption that the "covered" portion equals
$65,400 (the current maximum salary subject to social security tax) for all
employees receiving more than such amount and that the highest salary payable is
$100,000 per annum. Currently, no employee earns this much and the Bank does not
anticipate that any employee will in the foreseeable future.

         The total compensation covered by the pension plan for the year ended
December 31, 1995 was $2,617,791. 2.5% of the covered compensation represents
compensation paid to F. William Kuethe, Jr. His credited years of service is one
year. 0.6% of the covered compensation represents compensation paid to Jan W.
Clark.

         Benefits under the pension plan are not subject to deduction for social
security payments or other offsets.

Directors' Fees

         Each director receives a $600 fee for attending each meeting of the
board of directors or of committees of the board. During 1995, $94,625 was paid
in directors' fees.

Compensation Committee

         A compensation committee of directors approved by the board sets
director compensation. The board sets the compensation of the chief executive
officer. The chief executive officer sets the compensation of the other
executive officers. Executive officers are placed at certain grade levels with
the salary range of each grade level established by the compensation committee,
subject to board approval, based on comparable salaries paid by similar
financial institutions. Within such range, an individual's salary is based on a
performance review conducted by the board or president, as indicated above.
Bonuses are discretionary and largely based on the Bank's financial performance.

ITEM 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

         The executive officers and directors of the Bank enter into loan
transactions with the Bank in the ordinary course of business. Loans to them are
made on the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those
prevailing at the time for comparable loans with unrelated borrowers and the
Bank does not believe that they involve more than the normal risk of
collectibility or present other unfavorable features. At December 31, 1995,
1994, and 1993, the amounts of such loans outstanding were $2,878,742, $685,613,
and $535,347, respectively. The election in 1995 of new directors having
outstanding loans is the main reason for the increase in 1995.

                         Report of Independent Auditors



The Board of Directors and
  Stockholders
Glen Burnie Bancorp and Subsidiaries
Glen Burnie, Maryland


    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Glen Burnie
Bancorp and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Glen Burnie Bancorp and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for postretirement health care benefits in 1995.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

           The accounting and reporting policies reflected in the financial
     statements conform to generally accepted accounting principles and to
     general practices within the banking industry. Management makes estimates
     and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
     and disclosures of commitments and contingent liabilities at the date of
     the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the year. Actual
     results could differ from those estimates.

     Principles of consolidation

           The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Glen
     Burnie Bancorp (the Company) and its subsidiaries, The Bank of Glen Burnie
     (the Bank) and GBB Properties, Inc. Intercompany balances and transactions
     have been eliminated. The Parent Only financial statements of the Company
     account for the subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting.

     Business

           The Bank provides credit and deposit services to individuals and
     businesses located in Anne Arundel County and surrounding areas of central
     Maryland.

     Cash equivalents

           For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents
     include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, and federal funds sold.
     Generally, federal funds are purchased and sold for one-day periods.

     Investment securities

           In 1994, the Bank adopted Statement No. 115 of the Financial
     Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting for Certain Investments in
     Debt and Equity Securities. Management has reviewed its portfolio and
     classified securities as held to maturity or available for sale. Securities
     which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are
     recorded at amortized cost which is cost adjusted for amortization of
     premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Securities held to meet
     liquidity needs or which may be sold before maturity are classified as
     available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and
     losses included in stockholders' equity on an after tax basis.

           Gains and losses on disposal are determined using the
     specific-identification method.

     Loans

           Loans are stated at the current amount of unpaid principal, less
     deferred origination fees and the allowance for credit losses.

           Interest on loans is accrued based on the principal amounts
     outstanding. Origination fees are amortized to income over the terms of
     loans. Origination costs have been measured and determined by management to
     be immaterial to the financial statements. The accrual of interest is
     discontinued when management believes, after considering business
     conditions and collection efforts, that collection is doubtful.

     Allowance for credit losses

           The allowance for credit losses represents an amount which, in
     management's judgment will be adequate to absorb possible losses on
     existing loans and other extensions of credit that may become
     uncollectible. Management's judgment in determining the adequacy of the
     allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans. These
     evaluations take into consideration such factors as the volume and quality
     of the loan portfolio and current economic conditions that may affect the
     borrowers' ability to pay. Actual loan performance may differ from
     management's estimates.

           Management classifies loans as impaired when collection of
     contractual obligations, including principal and interest, is doubtful.

1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

     Ground rents

           Ground rents are recorded at cost.

     Bank premises and equipment

           Bank premises and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated
     depreciation. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of
     the assets using the straight-line and accelerated methods.

     Other real estate owned

           Real estate acquired through foreclosure is recorded at the lower of
     cost or fair market value on the date acquired. Losses incurred at the time
     of acquisition of the property are charged to the allowance for credit
     losses. Subsequent reductions in the estimated carrying value of the
     property and other expenses of owning the property are included in other
     operating expense.

     Software and intangible assets

           Costs incurred in the organization of the Company are being amortized
     over five years. Computer software is recorded at cost, and amortized over
     three to five years. A deposit acquisition premium is recorded at cost, and
     amortized over ten years. Amortization is computed using the straight-line
     method.

     Income taxes

           The provision for income taxes includes taxes payable for the current
     year and deferred income taxes. The Bank recognizes deferred tax assets and
     liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
     been reported differently in the financial statements and tax returns.
     Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
     on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
     and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
     differences are expected to reverse.

     Per share data

           Earnings per share are determined by dividing net income by the
     weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, giving
     retroactive effect to stock dividends declared. Weighted average shares
     were 861,116 for 1995, 833,849 for 1994, and 826,244 for 1993. Dividends
     per share are restated giving retroactive effect to stock dividends
     declared.

2.   Cash and Equivalents

           Cash and due from banks includes money market mutual fund accounts of
     $1,457,693, $1,253,540, and $173,996, at December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993,
     respectively.

           The Bank normally carries balances with another bank that exceed the
     federally insured limit. Average balances carried in excess of the limit
     were $4,010,911 for 1995, $6,663,893 for 1994, and $7,169,579 for 1993. The
     Bank sold federal funds, on a secured basis, to the same bank that averaged
     $2,416,318 for 1995, $2,798,922 for 1994, and $3,807,077 for 1993.

           Banks are required to carry noninterest-bearing cash reserves of
     specified percentages of deposit balances. The Bank's normal balances of
     cash on hand and on deposit with other banks are sufficient to satisfy the
     reserve requirements.

</TABLE>

           Loan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to a
     customer as long as there is no violation of any condition to the contract.
     Loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market
     amounts, fixed expiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Lines of
     credit generally have variable interest rates. Such lines do not represent
     future cash requirements because it is unlikely that all customers will
     draw upon their lines in full at any time. Letters of credit are
     commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
     party.

           The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
     the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment. Loan commitments,
     lines of credit and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including
     collateral, as outstanding loans. An allowance of $108,000 has been
     provided to record a possible loss on a letter of credit.

     the Bank's residential mortgage loans and by investment securities with an
     amortized cost of $3,004,119 at December 31, 1995.

           Notes payable to the U.S. Treasury are federal treasury tax and loan
     deposits accepted by the Bank from its customers to be remitted on demand
     to the Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank pays interest on these balances at a
     slight discount to the federal funds rate.

           The Bank also has available lines of credit, less amounts currently
     outstanding, of $1,000,000 in overnight federal funds and $2,000,000 in
     short-term secured credit from another bank.

10.  Pension and Profit Sharing Plans

           The Bank has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially
     all of the employees. Benefits are based on the employee's average rate of
     earnings for the five consecutive years before retirement. The Bank's
     funding policy is to contribute annually the maximum amount that can be
     deducted for income tax purposes, determined using the frozen entry age
     actuarial cost method. Assets of the plan are held in a trust fund
     principally comprised of growth and income mutual funds managed by another
     bank.

           The following table sets forth the financial status of the plan:

11.  Postretirement Health Care Benefits

           The Bank provides health care benefits to employees who retire at age
     65. The plan is funded only by the Bank's monthly payments of insurance
     premiums due. The following table sets forth the financial status of the
     plan at December 31, 1995:

     Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
       Retirees                                                   $185,057

                                                                  ========

           Net postretirement benefit expense for 
     1995 includes the following:

     Service cost                                                 $ 55,885
     Interest cost                                                  56,778
     Amortization of unrecognized transition obligation             33,399
                                                                  --------

     Net postretirement benefit expense                           $146,062
                                                                  ========

           Assumptions used in the accounting for
     net postretirement benefit
     expense were:

     Health care cost trend rate                                      8.0%
     Discount rate                                                    8.5%

           If the assumed health care cost trend rate were increased to 9.0%,
     the total of the service and interest cost components of net periodic
     postretirement health care benefit cost would increase by $28,808, and the
     accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would increase by $161,117.

12.  Litigation and Restructuring Charges

           In 1995, two opposing groups ran for election to the Board of
     Directors. The Company incurred legal expenses and entered into a severance
     agreement with a former executive officer in connection with this
     restructuring at costs totaling $687,841. The Company also incurred losses
     of $719,800 to settle the claim of a borrower who asserted damages for
     discrimination. These nonrecurring charges are included in operating
     expenses for 1995.

13.  Contingencies

           The Bank is involved in various legal actions arising from normal
     business activities. Management believes that the ultimate liability or
     risk of loss resulting from these actions will not materially affect the
     Bank's financial position.

     or $0.03 per share resulting from the adoption of FASB Statement No. 109.
     This amount represents the net increase in the deferred tax asset as of
     that date, and is included in the consolidated statements of income as the
     cumulative effect of an accounting change.

15.  Capital Standards

           The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance
     Corporation have adopted risk-based capital standards for banking
     organizations. These standards require minimum ratios of capital to
     risk-based assets of 4 percent for Tier 1 capital and 8 percent for total
     capital. Tier 1 capital consists of stockholders' equity, excluding the
     unrealized net gain or loss, after applicable income taxes, on investment
     securities available for sale, and total capital includes a limited amount
     of the allowance for credit losses. In calculating risk-weighted assets,
     specified risk percentages are applied to each category of asset and
     off-balance sheet items.

           The Company and the Bank must also maintain minimum capital leverage
     ratios of 3 to 5 percent of Tier 1 capital to average total assets. The
     standard is based on a discretionary evaluation of the Bank's risk profile
     by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.

           A bank is considered well capitalized if it has minimum Tier 1 and
     total risk-based capital ratios of 6 percent and 10 percent, respectively,
     and a minimum leverage ratio of 5 percent.

           The Company's capital ratios, capital balances, and risk-weighted
     assets at December 31 were as follows:

     as follows:

</TABLE>

           The fair values of investment securities are estimated using a matrix
     that considers yield to maturity, credit quality, and marketability. This
     method of valuation is permitted by the FASB, but may not be indicative of
     net realizable or liquidation values.

           It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of loans with fixed
     maturities, deposit liabilities with fixed maturities, or outstanding
     credit commitments. The Company does not presently have available resources
     to estimate fair values based on quoted prices or discounted cash flows for
     individual accounts or groups of accounts.

           Maturities and weighted-average interest rates on loans and deposits
     with fixed maturities are as follows:

18.  Related Party Transactions

           The executive officers and directors of the Bank enter into loan
     transactions with the Bank in the ordinary course of business. These loans
     were made on the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as
     those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with unrelated borrowers.
     At December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, the amounts of such loans outstanding
     were $2,878,742, $685,613, and $535,347, respectively.

19.  Stockholders' Equity

           Employees who have completed one year of service are eligible to
     participate in the employee stock purchase plan. The plan allows employees
     to purchase stock at 85 percent of the fair market value. At December 31,
     1995, there were 31,980 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under
     the plan. Options for 4,555 of those shares are outstanding, at $26.92 per
     share, expiring October 1, 1996. Options for 6,586 shares were exercised in
     1995 at prices of $24.08 to $26.92 per share.

           The director stock purchase plan allows directors to purchase stock
     at the fair market value on the date an option is granted. At December 31,
     1995, there were 17,700 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under
     the plan. Options for 300 of those shares are outstanding at $31.67 per
     share, expiring October 1, 1997. Options for 3,600 shares were exercised in
     1995 at prices of $28.33 to $31.67 per share.

           The dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan allows
     participating stockholders to invest their cash dividends in stock at 95
     percent of the fair market value on the dividend payment date. At December
     31, 1995, there were 105,190 shares of common stock reserved for issuance
     under the plan.

           The number of shares and prices per share have been retroactively
     adjusted for stock dividends declared.

           The Board of Directors may suspend or discontinue any of the plans at
     its discretion.

20.  Regulatory Matters

           The FDIC has advised management that it will ask the Bank to agree to
     a Memorandum of Understanding that management will correct violations of
     law, improve loan administration and loan loss accounting methods, improve
     loan collections, improve information to the board of directors, adopt a
     strategic plan and budget, and maintain adequate capital.

<PAGE>

         The option Price shall be paid in full at the time an Option is
         exercised under the Plan. Promptly after the exercise of an Option and
         the full payment of the Option Price, the Participant shall be entitled
         to the issuance of a stock certificate evidencing ownership of such
         Stock. A participant shall have none of the rights of a Stockholder
         with respect to shares under option as provided in the Plan until
         shares are issued, and no adjustment will be made for dividends or
         other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such stock
         certificate is issued.

9.       Options to Purchase Shares not Transferable:

         Options granted to an Eligible Stockholder under the Plan are
         exercisable during such Eligible Stockholders' lifetime, up to the

         not be sold, transferred (other than by will or the laws of descent and

         exceptions to the provisions in paragraph 11 of this Plan.

10.      Amendment and Termination:

         The Board of Directors may terminate, amend, or revise the Plan with
         respect to any shares on which Options have been granted. Neither the
         Board nor the Committee may, without the consent of the holder of an
         Option, alter or impair any Option previously granted under the Plan,
         except as authorized herein. No such revision or amendment shall change
         the number of shares subject to the Plan or permit granting of Options
         under the Plan to persons other than the Stockholders of Glen Burnie
         Bancorp.

11.      Death:

         If an Eligible Stockholder dies without having fully exercised his
         Options under this Plan, the executors or administrators, or legatees
         or heirs of the estate shall have the right to exercise such Options to
         the extent that such deceased Stockholder was entitled to exercise the
         Options on the date of death.

12.      Commencement of Plan:

         The Plan shall not take effect until approved by the Board of Directors
         in accordance with the approval given at the March 14, 1996 Annual
         meeting of Stockholders.

13.      Governmental Approvals or Consents:

         The Plan and any Options granted thereunder are subject to any
         governmental approvals or consent that may be or become applicable in
         connection therewith. The Board may make such


<PAGE>


         changes in the Plan and include such terms in any Option granted under
         the Plan as may be necessary or desirable, in the opinion of counsel of
         Glen Burnie Bancorp, to comply with the rules or regulations of any
         governmental authority, or to be eligible for tax benefits under the
         Internal Revenue Code or laws of any State.

14.      Preemptive Rights:

         Glen Burnie Bancorp stock has preemptive rights that allow Shareholders
         to maintain an existing percentage of ownership in the Corporation. The
         adoption of this Plan affects the Shareholders of the Corporation
         because there is some dilution of their percentage of ownership.
         Therefore, this Plan would be an exception to normal preemptive rights.

                               GLEN BURNIE BANCORP

                  DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN


         The stockholders of Glen Burnie Bancorp, hereinafter referred to as
"the Corporation," have approved this Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan. The Plan relates to 100,000 authorized but unissued shares of common stock
of the Corporation. The Plan is intended to provide holders of stock who
participate with a convenient and economical method of increasing their equity
ownership in the Corporation by purchasing additional shares of stock without
payment of any brokerage commission, service charges or any fees. The approved
Plan is as follows:

1. NATURE OF THE PLAN

         The purpose of this Plan is to provide stockholders with a convenient
and economical method of increasing their equity ownership in the Corporation.
The Plan allows the stockholders to elect and become participants in the Plan
and thereafter receive their dividends, if and when declared by the Board of
Directors, in the form of stock in lieu of cash distributions. The holders of
stock who do not participate will continue to receive cash dividends in the
usual manner, if and when declared.

2.       ELIGIBILITY

         All record holders of common stock are eligible to participate in the
Plan. The right to participate in the Plan is not transferrable. Stockholders
who reside in jurisdictions in which it is unlawful for the Corporation to
permit their participation are not eligible to participate in the Plan. The
Corporation also reserves the right to exclude a stockholder who resides in a
foreign country or in a jurisdiction which requires registration or
qualification of the stock or of the Corporation's directors, officers or other
employees as agents in connection with sales pursuant to Plan.

         An eligible stockholder may join the Plan by signing the election form
and returning it to the Plan Administrator. Stockholders may become participants
at any time. Any stockholder who does not elect to participate in the Plan will
continue to receive any dividends declared by the Board of Directors in cash (or
in stock if the Board of Directors declares a stock dividend for all
stockholders). A stockholder already participating in the Plan will continue to
participate until such stockholder gives notice to the Corporation in the manner
prescribed herein that he wishes to withdraw from the Plan.

3.       CREDITING OF ACCOUNTS

         If the Stockholder Authorization Form signed by a stockholder entitled
to a dividend is received by the Corporation before the Declaration Date for the
next dividend payment, the participant shall receive his next dividend payment
in the form of stock under the Plan. The participant shall thereafter continue
to receive any dividends on his common stock as stock under the Plan until he
withdraws from participation in the Plan or the shares are transferred of record
to a new owner. The participant's account

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
Page 2


shall be credited with such stock on the payable date, which shall be the date
cash dividends are actually paid to stockholders as of the Record Date.

         Nothing in this Section shall be construed as providing any assurance
that dividends will be declared by the Corporation in the future.

4.       ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

         The Glen Burnie Bancorp administers the Plan for participants, keeps
records, sends statements of accounts to participants and performs other duties
relating to the Plan. All correspondence relating to the Plan should be directed
to:

                  President
                  Glen Burnie Bancorp
                  107 Crain Highway, S.E.
                  Glen Burnie, Maryland 21061

         The Plan Administrator receives the participants' dividend payments and
invests such amounts in additional shares of common stock, maintains continuing
records of each participant's account, and advises participants as to all
transactions in and the status of their accounts. The Plan Administrator acts in
the capacity of agent for the participants.

         All notices from the Plan Administrator to a participant will be
addressed to the participant at the last address of record with the Plan
Administrator. The mailing of a notice to a participant's last address of record
will satisfy the Plan Administrator's duty of giving notice to such participant.
Therefore, participants must promptly notify the Plan Administrator of any
change of address.

         Neither the Plan Administrator, the participants' nominee or nominees,
nor Glen Burnie Bancorp shall have any responsibility beyond the exercise of
ordinary care for any reasonable and prudent actions taken or omitted pursuant
to the Plan including, without limitation, any claim for liability arising out
of failure to terminate a participant's account upon such participant's death or
adjudicated incompetency prior to receipt of notice in writing of such death or
adjudicated incompetency, nor shall they have any duties, responsibilities or
liabilities except such as are expressly set forth in the Plan.

         All transactions in connection with the Plan shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Maryland, and by any applicable federal tax or security
laws.

5.       STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS OF PARTICIPANTS AND OTHER DISCLOSURE OF
         INFORMATION

         As soon as practicable after each payment date, each participant will
receive a statement of his account.



<PAGE>


GLEN BURNIE BANCORP
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
Page 3


         These statements of a participant's account should be retained by the
participant as an ongoing statement of his account under the Plan and for income
tax purposes.

         In addition to such statements of account, each participant will
receive all disclosure statements, otherwise sent to stockholders, including the
annual report, notices of stockholder meetings, and proxy statements of the
Corporation.

6.       EXPENSES OF ADMINISTRATION

         Participants will not be charged brokerage or commission fees or
service charges in connection with purchases of shares of common stock under the
Plan. All administrative expenses of the Plan will be paid by the Corporation.

7.       DIVIDENDS OF STOCK CREDITED UNDER THE PLAN

         Any portion of the dividends which have been credited to a
participant's account will be paid as stock under the provisions of this Plan.

8.       CERTIFICATES FOR STOCK

         Certificates will be issued to a participant for whole shares of common
stock in the participant's account (1) Upon the participant's written request to
the Corporation at its principal office, (2) if the participant withdraws from
the Plan, or (3) if the Corporation terminates the Plan. Requests will be
handled by the Corporation without charge. Any remaining whole or fractional
shares will continue to be held in the participant's account. No certificate for
a fractional share will be issued; under the Plan, dividends on a fractional
share will be credited to a participant's account. Withdrawal of shares in the
form of a certificate in no way affects dividend reinvestment.

9.       WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PLAN

         Participation in the Plan is entirely voluntary, and a participant may
request to withdraw from the Plan at any time by notifying the Corporation in
writing in its Principal Office.

         Upon withdrawal from the Plan, the participant will receive
certificates for full shares of common stock then held in his account. Any
fractional shares in the participant's account shall be redeemed by the
Corporation for cash in an amount equal to the fraction of a whole share times
the "fair market value" of the common stock as determined under the provisions
of the Plan at the last Declaration Date prior to the date of withdrawal.


<PAGE>


GLEN BURNIE BANCORP
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
Page 4

         If the request to withdraw is received on or after the Declaration Date
for a dividend payment and the withdrawing participant has previously elected to
receive dividend payments in the form of stock, any dividend paid on the
corresponding payable date will be credited to the withdrawing participant's
account as stock in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. The request to
withdraw will then be processed promptly following such payable date.
Thereafter, all dividends will be paid in cash (or in stock dividends if so
declared by the Board of Directors on all common stock) to the stockholder who
withdraws from the Plan. A stockholder may elect again to become a participant
at any time subsequent to withdrawal from the Plan.

         If a participant disposes of any or all of his shares of common stock
registered in his name other than shares credited to the participant's account
under the Plan, the shares of common stock credited under the Plan shall
continue to be administered under the provisions of the Plan unless the
participant notifies the Corporation of his withdrawal from the Plan.

10.      PURCHASE PRICE OF SHARES

         The "Purchase Price" shall mean fair market value, the amount equal to
the latest trade by Legg Mason Wood Walker, but in no event less than One
Hundred Twenty percent (120%) of book value at the end of the most recent fiscal
year unless the Board of Directors in its discretion determines otherwise.

11.      FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

         A participant who has cash dividends reinvested in additional shares of
common stock under the provisions of the Plan will be treated for federal income
tax purposes (under the Code) as having received a cash dividend in an amount
equal to the "fair market value" (determined under the Plan) of all full and
fractional shares credited to the participant's account. The participant's tax
basis (under the Code) in the shares credited under the Plan will be an amount
equal to such shares 'fair market value' as determined under this Plan.

         A participant will also realize gains or loss upon receipt, following
termination of participation in the Plan, of a cash payment for any fractional
share interests credited to the Participant's account. The amount of any such
gain or loss will be the difference between the amount that the participant
received for the shares or fractional share interests and the tax basis thereof.

         To the extent distributions by Glen Burnie Bancorp to its stockholders
are treated as made from the Corporation's earnings and profits, the
distribution under the Plan will be taxable as a dividend.

         The tax basis of any shares acquired through the Plan will be the fair
market value as of the Dividend Payable Date. The holding period for shares
acquired through the Plan will begin on the day after the Dividend Payable Date.

         The tax consequences as set forth above are for informational purposes
only and should not be relied upon as a legal or accounting opinion in regard to
a particular participant's circumstances. Each stockholder considering
participating in the Plan is urged to consult his own tax and financial advisors
as to federal, state and other tax consequences of participating in the Plan
based upon his particular facts and circumstances.

12.      TERMINATION BY THE CORPORATION

         Although the Corporation intends to continue the Plan in the future,
the Board of Directors reserves the right to amend, suspend or modify the Plan
at any time. However, the Plan can not be permanently terminated unless the
stockholders at a regular or special meeting vote to terminate said Plan.
Written notice of any such amendment, suspension, modification or termination
will be sent to the participants within thirty (30) days following any such
action. The Corporation also may adopt reasonable procedures for administration
of the Plan.

13.      PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

         The existing stockholders of the Corporation have the right to maintain
their existing percentage of ownership. The existing stockholder has a right to
purchase new stock in the proportion that the number of shares held by him bears
to the whole number, before the increase. Existing stockholders who do not
participate in the Plan will have some dilution of their percentage ownership.
Therefore, the adoption of the Plan by the stockholders is an exception to the
normal preemptive rights.

14.      USE OF PROCEEDS

         The net proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered pursuant to
the Plan will be used for general corporate purposes including investments or
extensions of credit.

15.      SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION INFORMATION

         The securities referred to in the Plan have not been approved or
disapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission nor has the Commission
passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of any prospectus. The securities offered
hereby are not deposits or savings accounts and are not insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or
instrumentality.

         This Plan will not take effect until all necessary regulatory approvals
are obtained.

        the date upon which such Option is granted.

8.      Method of Payment:

               The Option Price shall be paid in full at the time an Option is
        exercised under the Plan. Promptly after the exercise of an Option and
        the full payment of the Option Price, the Participant shall be entitled
        to the issuance of a stock certificate evidencing ownership of such
        Stock. A participant shall have none of the rights of a shareholder with
        respect to shares under option as provided in the Plan until shares are
        issued, and no adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights for
        which the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is
        issued.

9.      Options to Purchase Shares not Transferable:

               Options granted to an Eligible Director under the Plan are
        exercisable during such Eligible Directors' lifetime, up to the
        limitation in paragraph 6, only by the Director; such Options may not be
        sold, transferred (other than by will or the laws of descent and
        distribution), pledged, or otherwise disposed or encumbered.

10.     Amendment and Termination:

               The Board of Directors may terminate, amend, or revise the Plan
        with respect to any shares, on which Options have not been granted.
        Neither the Board nor the Committee may, without the consent of the
        holder of an Option, alter or impair any Option previously granted under
        the Plan, except as authorized herein. No such revision or amendment
        shall change the number of shares subject to the Plan or permit granting
        of Options under the Plan to persons other than the Directors of Glen
        Burnie Bancorp.

11.     Death:

               If a Director dies during the term of office, or after having
        retired, and without having fully exercised open Options, the executors
        or administrators, or legatees or heirs, of the estate shall have the
        right to exercise such Options to the extent that such deceased Director
        was entitled to exercise the Options on the date of death; provided,
        however, that in no event shall the Options be exercisable more than
        twelve (12) months from the date they were granted, or within nine (9)
        months after Letters of Administration are issued.

12.     Commencement of Plan:

               The Plan shall not take effect until approved by the Board of
        Directors in accordance with the approval given at the March 11, 1993
        stockholders' meeting.

13.     Governmental Approvals or Consents:

               The Plan and any Options granted thereunder are subject to any
        governmental approvals or consent that may be or become applicable in
        connection therewith. The Board may make such changes in the Plan and
        include such terms in any Option granted under the Plan as may be
        necessary or desirable, in the opinion of counsel of Glen Burnie
        Bancorp, to comply with the rules or regulations of any governmental
        authority, or to be eligible for tax benefits under the Internal Revenue
        Code or laws of any State.

14.     Preemptive Rights:

               Glen Burnie Bancorp stock has preemptive rights that allow
        shareholders to maintain an existing percentage of ownership in the
        Corporation. The adoption of this plan affects the shareholders of the
        Corporation because there is some dilution of their percentage of
        ownership. Therefore, this plan would be an exception to normal
        preemptive rights.

4.       STOCK
         The Stock subject to the Options shall be shares of The Bank of Glen
         Burnie authorized but unissued ($10.00 par value per share). The
         aggregate number of Shares which may be issued under Options shall not
         exceed shares of such Common Stock; (except for adjustments under
         Section 5). Shares optioned and not accepted, or if accepted, not

         following additional limitations. 
         (a)      All Eligible Employees shall enjoy equal rights and privileges

                  shall bear a uniform relationship to compensation.

                  ownership of an Eligible Employee exceeds this 5% limit, the
                  rules of Section 425(d) of the Internal Revenue Code (relating

                  his right to purchase Stock under all such plans of The Bank
                  of Glen Burnie to accrue at a rate which exceeds in any one
                  calendar year $25,000 of the Fair Market Value of the Stock
                  determined as of the date the Option is granted.

         With respect to any Option, the Board will specify the number of Shares
         to be made available, the Date of Grant, the terms of the Option, and
         such terms and conditions not inconsistent with this Plan as may be
         necessary or appropriate, provided that in no event shall the terms of
         the Option extend more than 27 months from the Date of Grant.

         In the event of a recapitalization or reclassification affecting Common
         Stock, the number of Shares which may thereafter be issued under the
         Plan, the number of Shares under Option at such time, and the Option
         price will be appropriately adjusted as determined by the Board.

         not less than three members of the Board who are not eligible to
         participate in the Plan, one of whom shall be designated as Chairman.
         The Committee is vested with full authority to make, administer, and
         interpret such equitable rules and regulations regarding the Plan as it
         may deem advisable, subject to the terms of the Plan. Its
         determinations as to the interpretation and operation of the Plan shall
         be final and conclusive.

         The Committee may act by a majority vote at a regular or special
         meeting or by decision reduced to writing and signed by a majority of

         Members of the Committee shall be named by the Board. Vacancies shall
         be filled by the Board.

7.       PROCEDURE FOR GRANT AND ACCEPTANCE OF OPTION
         An Eligible Employee shall be notified by The Bank of Glen Burnie of
         the Grant of any Option or Options to him. In order to participate in
         the Plan, the Eligible Employee must sign an Acceptance of Option on a
         form provided by The Bank of Glen Burnie showing the number of Shares
         that he elects to purchase, and must deliver it within 30 days after
         the date appearing on the form to the Secretary or other officer
         designated in the Option. If an eligible employee elects to accept the
         option, he must accept an Option to purchase the number of Shares
         specified in his Option, or a lesser number of shares but in no event
         less than shares.

         Shares optioned and not accepted, or if accepted, not purchased, shall
         continue to be available for inclusion in any subsequent Options that
         may be granted under the Plan.

8.       PURCHASE PRICE
         The purchase price per Share will be an amount equal to the lesser of %
         of the Fair Market Value of such Share on the Date of Grant or % of the
         Fair Market Value of such Share on the Date of Exercise; provided,
         however, and subject to the foregoing, in no event shall the purchase
         price be less than book value per Share unless the Board in its
         discretion so determines.

9.       METHOD OF PAYMENT
         Payment for Shares under Options accepted pursuant to the Plan shall be
         made in a lump sum payment within the term specified by the committee
         which in no case will be longer than 27 months.

                                   (Continued)


9.       METHOD OF PAYMENT (Continued)
         The Date of Exercise for options accepted under this Plan shall be the
         date of the lump sum payment.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein set forth, an Eligible
         Employee who has accepted an option may at any time prior to the
         expiration of 30 days after his termination of employment with The Bank
         of Glen Burnie but in no event after the expiration of a period of 27
         months from the Date of Grant, prepay the outstanding amount due.

         For purposes of this Section, an Eligible Employee shall not be deemed
         to have terminated his employment while he is on military leave, sick
         leave, furlough, lay-off, or other bona fide leave of absence
         (including but not limited to temporary employment by the Government)
         if the period of such leave of absence does not exceed 90 days, or if
         longer, so long as his right to reemployment with The Bank of Glen
         Burnie is guaranteed by law or by contract. Where the period of leave
         exceeds 90 days and where the Eligible Employee's right to reemployment
         not guaranteed either by law or by contract, such Eligible Employee
         will be deemed to have terminated his employment on the 91st day of
         such leave.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein set forth, no Options
         granted under the Plan may be exercised prior to such date as may be
         fixed by the Board of Directors.

10.      RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER
         An Eligible Employee will become a stockholder with respect to Shares
         for which payment has been completed at the Date of Exercise. An
         Eligible Employee will not have any rights as a stockholder with
         respect to Shares under Option as provided in the Plan until he has
         become a stockholder as provided in the Plan. A certificate for the
         Shares purchased will be issued as soon as practicable after an
         Eligible Employee becomes a stockholder.

11.      OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES NOT TRANSFERABLE
         Options granted to an Eligible Employee under the plan are exercisable,
         during such Eligible Employee's lifetime, only by him; such Options may
         not be sold, transferred (other than by will or the laws of descent and
         distribution), pledged, or otherwise disposed of or encumbered.

                                   (Continued)


12.      CANCELLATION OF ACCEPTANCE OF OPTION
         At any time prior to, but in no event following, his Date of Exercise,
         an Eligible Employee who has elected to purchase Shares may cancel his
         Acceptance of Option as to any or all of such Shares by written notice
         of cancellation delivered to the officer designated to receive his
         Acceptance of Option. If an Eligible Employee cancels his Acceptance of
         option as to only a part of the Shares, he shall make the required
         payment as provided in Section 9 above with respect to the number of
         Shares for which his Acceptance of Option is not cancelled.

13.      EFFECT OF FAILURE TO MAKE PAYMENTS WHEN DUE
         Subject to other provisions of the Plan permitting postponement, The
         Bank of Glen Burnie may treat the failure by an Eligible Employee to
         make any payment as a cancellation of his Acceptance of Option. In that
         event, the Eligible Employee will be notified of such cancellation by
         mailing notice to him at his last known business or home address.

14.      RETIREMENT
         If the employment of an Eligible Employee is terminated by retirement
         prior to the end of the Option Period, and such Eligible Employee may
         elect to pay for his Shares within months of his termination of
         employment by retirement, but in no event later than 27 months after

         period of 27 months after the Date of Grant (1) to pay the amount due,
         or (2) to cancel the Eligible Employee's Acceptance of Option in

         stockholders' meeting, which approval must occur within the period
         beginning twelve months before and ending twelve months after the date
         the Plan is adopted by the Board.

Re:      The Bank of Glen Burnie Pension Plan -
         Annual Review and Actuarial Valuation

Dear Committee Members:

This report presents the results of the annual review and actuarial valuation of
The Bank of Glen Burnie Pension Plan prepared for the 1996 Plan Year and sets
forth the contribution required for the plan year ending December 31, 1996.

The valuation was performed on the basis of employee census data submitted by
The Bank of Glen Burnie and upon investment fund data submitted by the Trustee,
First National Bank of Maryland.

Turner Pension Consultants, LLC has been retained by The Bank of Glen Burnie to
perform this valuation on behalf of plan participants. The report has been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and
practices. The actuarial assumptions that have been used are reasonably related
to the experience of the plan and to reasonable expectations and represent the
enrolled actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.

This report reflects the following:

         -        The minimum funding requirement for 1996 increased from
                  $113,263 (4.7% of prior year's compensation) to $120,824 (4.6%
                  of prior year's compensation).

         -        No quarterly contributions are required for the 1996 plan
                  year.

         -        The maximum deductible contribution for fiscal year ending
                  December 31, 1996 is $233,910 (8.9% of prior year's
                  compensation) compared to $223,043 (9.2% of prior year's
                  compensation) for the previous year. To be deductible, the
                  contribution must be deposited prior to the due date of the
                  Bank's federal tax return.

         -        As was the case in the past, the Bank of Glen Burnie Pension
                  Plan is not "top-heavy" for plan year beginning January 1,
                  1996.

         -        On September 18, 1995, the Bank of Glen Burnie purchased a
                  branch of First Union Bank. The employees of this branch
                  (Eberhardt, Fitzpatrick, Knopp, Sutton and Youngbar) have
                  received credit for benefit accrual from September 18, 1995.
                  They have received eligibility and vesting credit from their
                  date of hire with First Union.

After you have had an opportunity to review this report, please call if you have
any questions or wish to review and discuss the valuation.

Respectfully Submitted,

                   CALCULATION OF THE FULL FUNDING LIMITATION
                   FOR THE PLAN YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 1996

         The maximum deductible contribution permitted under a defined benefit
plan is subject to two special "full funding limitation" tests which measure the
funded status of the plan.

         The first test limits the deductible contribution to an amount needed
to fully fund the expected accrued liability by the end of the year. The accrued
liability projected to the end of the year is a function of the actuarial cost
method being used to determine plan contributions and is computed using the
valuation interest rate of 8%. It will usually exceed the true liability for
benefits accrued under the plan since it reflects any pre-funding of benefits
which the actuarial cost method may generate. One such example of pre-funding is
the recognition of expected future salary increases in determining current
contribution levels. The application of this test is as follows:

         (1)      Actuarial Accrued Liability as of 1/1/96          $3,424,053

         (2)      Entry Age Normal Cost for 1996                       219,684

         (3)      Interest on (1) and (2) at 8%                        291,499

         (4)      Expected Pension Payments during 1996                132,800

                   CALCULATION OF THE FULL FUNDING LIMITATION
                   FOR THE PLAN YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 1996
                                   (continued)

         The second test limits the deductible contribution to an amount needed
to increase plan assets to 150% of the "current liability". The "current
liability" is the actual value of benefits accumulated as of the valuation date.
The interest rate used to compute the "current liability" must also fall within
an allowable range which is based on a weighted average of the rates of interest
on 30 year Treasury securities over the preceding four years. The rate selected
for the current year was 7.5 %. This test is shown below:

         (13)     Current Liability as of 1/1/96
                  (including benefits accruing during year)         $2,803,455

         (14)     Interest on (13) at 7.5%                             210,259

         (15)     Expected Pension Payments during 1996                132,800

         (16)     Interest on (15) at 7.5%                               5,395

         (17)     Expected Current Liability on 12/31/96
                  (13)+(14)-(15)-(16)                               $2,875,519

         (18)     150% Expected Current Liability                    4,313,279

         (19)     Expected Assets on 12/31/96 from (11)              3,394,819

         (20)     150% Full Funding Limitation (18)-(19)              $918,460

The combined result of these two tests is as follows:

         (21)     Full Funding Limitation as of 12/31/96
                  Lesser of (12) or (20)                              $402,042

                            FUNDING STANDARD ACCOUNT
                             FOR THE PLAN YEAR ENDED
                                DECEMBER 31, 1995


         ERISA requires that each defined benefit pension plan meet or exceed
certain minimum funding standards in order to enhance the security of each
employee's benefits. The device by which it is determined whether the standards
are met is the "funding standard account".

         Any excess of credits over charges is a credit balance which is carried
forward and may be used to reduce future funding requirements. Any excess of
charges over credits is a funding deficiency which is subject to the excise tax
penalties prescribed by ERISA.

         The operation of the funding standard account for the plan year ended
December 31, 1995 is shown below:

                                 ACTUARIAL BASIS

Valuation of Liabilities

A.       Description of Actuarial Cost Method

         This valuation was performed using the frozen entry age actuarial cost
         method (frozen initial liability method). Under this method, the
         contribution equals the sum of the amount necessary to amortize the
         frozen actuarial liabilities over a period of years and the normal cost
         of the plan.

         The frozen actuarial liability as of January 1, 1977 was equal to the
         actuarial accrued liability on that date as determined under the entry
         age normal actuarial cost method. Additional liability bases were
         created since then due to changes in assumptions and plan amendments.
         In the absence of any further changes in plan benefits or actuarial
         assumptions, these frozen actuarial liabilities will remain unchanged
         in future valuations. However in the future, as contributions are made
         to amortize the frozen actuarial liabilities, the unfunded frozen
         actuarial liabilities will decrease until they reach zero.

         The normal cost is calculated in the aggregate (i.e. the actuarial
         present values of projected benefits and future compensation are
         totaled for all participants before the normal cost is calculated).

         The normal cost accrual rate for the current group of participants
         should remain approximately level from year to year. Changes in the
         characteristics of the group due to new entrants, differences between
         actuarial assumptions and actual experience, changes in actuarial
         assumptions, and changes in plan provisions will lead to changes in the
         normal cost accrual rate.

                                    limitation was based on a 7.5% rate.

         For Purposes of FASB #35           8% compounded annually.

                 Statement Re: Computation Of Per Share Earnings


         Per share earnings have been computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average of shares outstanding. Shares issued or retired during a period
are weighted by the fraction of the period in which they were outstanding. The
weighted number of these shares is added to or deducted from the number of
shares outstanding at the beginning of the period to obtain the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during the period.
