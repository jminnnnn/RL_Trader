                                    PART I

  ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

  GENERAL

  SatCon Technology Corporation (the "Company" or "SatCon") was organized as a
  Massachusetts corporation in February 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in
  1992. SatCon designs, develops and manufactures intelligent, electro-
  mechanical products for aerospace, transportation, industrial, and utility
  applications. SatCon's electro-mechanical products are being developed for a
  wide variety of U.S. government and commercial markets. For the government,
  SatCon's electro-mechanical systems provide low vibration and high power for
  applications ranging from satellite attitude control to high speed drives for
  shipboard systems. In the transportation segment SatCon is developing electric
  and hybrid electric drive components, auxiliary power units, and advanced
  steering, suspension, and braking systems. SatCon is working with major
  equipment producers to develop process equipment drives, high speed and
  precision machine tools, manipulators, and machinery isolation equipment.
  SatCon's electro-mechanical systems may offer to the utility industry
  advantages in power generation, energy storage, and power quality. In the
  consumer market SatCon is developing freon-free compressors for refrigerators,
  variable speed motors, and other long-life, high-efficiency machinery.

  STRATEGY

  The transition to a new generation of products being developed by SatCon is
  being fueled by a combination of market demand for higher performance and
  improved efficiency, and by the potential to satisfy these needs made possible
  by advances in materials and electronics technologies. It is the Company's
  strategy to accelerate leading edge developments by continuing to expand its
  externally funded contract research and development from both government and
  commercial sources. The Company believes that this funding can be used to
  develop products which can be sold to government agencies and possibly
  transition into viable commercial products. In most instances individual
  components have multiple applications across these markets.

  These product developments typically progress through a technology and concept
  development phase and, if appropriate, into a prototype build phase. Once
  demonstrated, the Company intends to leverage these prototype developments
  into 'beta site' units that can be purchased by, or jointly developed with,
  commercial customers for evaluation. Upon completion of beta site testing,
  decisions by potential customers will determine the viability of continuing
  into pre-production manufacturing and further testing and evaluation. In the
  past two years, SatCon has been successful in developing relationships with
  potential commercial customers for its technology and prototype demonstration
  units. These relationships can provide a foundation for the Company's
  continuing product development efforts while building a potential market base
  for those products in production quantities.

  To date, the Company has entered into discussions with such companies as 
  Delco-Remy, General Motors, TRW, Applied Materials, Westinghouse and Allied
  Signal and intends to seek to form relationships that can utilize the sales,
  marketing and distribution channels as well as manufacturing capabilities of
  these organizations to further the commercialization of SatCon's technologies.

  DEVELOPMENTS DURING 1996

  General

  During Fiscal 1996, the Company was involved in a number of activities
  including the following:

  The Company delivered five "beta-site" units of an integrated suspension and
  motor system to Applied Materials, a manufacturer of semiconductor wafer
  fabrication equipment, for evaluation.  If this evaluation is successful, the
  components could be used in a next-generation wafer processing system.

  The Company also developed an  alpha demonstration unit of it's flywheel
  "Inertial Battery" intended for use as a replacement for lead-acid batteries
  in uninterruptible power supply systems.  Potential customers include
  telecommunications companies such as cable television and telephony service
  suppliers.

                                      2  
<PAGE>
 
  The Company also participated in several efforts with various commercial
  customers to develop new products and product improvements including an
  improved performance alternator for commercial vehicles;  control electronics
  for a commercial manufacturer of turbines that will provide power regulation
  for a turbine being developed for potential applications in alternative fuel
  vehicles; and flywheel integrated power and attitude control systems for
  commercial satellite applications.

  Organizational Developments

  In September 1996, the Company further refined its organizational structure.
  The Technology Division and Energy Systems Division remained relatively
  unchanged with a new division, Tucson Space and Electro-Optics Division being
  created.  The Company also opened a sales office in the Detroit, Michigan area
  to better service its automotive customers.

  The TECHNOLOGY DIVISION, located in Cambridge, continues the research and
  development work that has historically been conducted at SatCon.  It will
  concentrate on developing advanced technologies through "integrated product
  teams" in motors and high speed drives, power electronics, magnetic bearings
  and suspension systems, and propulsion systems.  As technology developments
  mature into potential products, product divisions may be created to further
  advance the applications and marketing efforts.  At the end of fiscal 1996,
  SatCon had two such divisions.

  The ENERGY SYSTEMS DIVISION, located in SatCon's Cambridge offices, is focused
  on the product development and marketing of flywheel "Inertial Battery"
  systems for such markets as utilities, cable television and
  telecommunications, where uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) are critical to
  maintaining service.  Although these markets represent a major opportunity
  base, other industrial users will be pursued as well.  Power outages can be
  costly to many major industries which experience downtime and lost throughput
  whenever outages cause production line shut-down. SatCon's flywheel systems
  may provide a cost effective alternative to battery systems which have limited
  life and whose disposal is potentially hazardous to the environment.

  The TUCSON SPACE AND ELECTRO-OPTICS DIVISION is located in Tucson, AZ and is
  focused on two major product areas.  The first is a flywheel energy storage
  system to be used as a new integrated power and attitude control system for
  satellites that eliminates chemical batteries and combines their function with
  that of satellite steering.  The second is electro-optic sensing systems for
  applications such as earth mapping, mine hunting, commercial fishing and food
  inspection devices.

  FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

  The Company continued its funded research and development with various U.S.
  Government agencies during Fiscal 1996.  Projects included a flywheel energy
  storage system for NASA for use in future satellite applications; a
  terrestrial based flywheel energy storage system for the Marine Corps;
  potentially cost effective permanent magnet variable speed drives for
  auxiliary applications on U.S. Navy Ships that can integrate high density
  drive electronics with innovative permanent magnet motors for hydraulic pump
  motors, circulating pumps and compressors; a lightweight, low volume
  alternator and a high efficiency power electronics drive for the Army, and
  several reaction mass actuator application programs for helicopters.  SatCon
  is also working with the Air Force to investigate the use of new specialty
  shape memory alloys in air foil controls for greater fuel efficiency and with
  several other agencies on the development of high power density electronics
  modules called Power Electronic Building Blocks or PEBB's.

  COMMERCIALIZATION

  The Company intends to continue directing its commercialization efforts in the
  following product areas:

  Flywheel Energy Storage Systems

  By integrating energy-storing flywheels made of high-strength materials with
  high-power, permanent magnet motor/generators, SatCon has developed electro-
  mechanical storage systems that management believes have the potential to
  offer practical solutions for mobile and stationary applications.  SatCon
  flywheel systems are anticipated to provide extremely high power output and
  energy storage in compact packages.  They may be a long-lasting, light-weight,
  and environmentally sound alternative to conventional batteries.

                                      3  
<PAGE>
 
  SatCon's Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) systems offer an alternative to lead-
  acid batteries as uninterruptible power supplies for the telecommunications
  industry, including cable television and telephone service providers, which
  are required to maintain service during power outages.  In addition these
  systems can be used to provide backup for critical industrial processes and
  machines, as power supplies for satellites and as energy recovery systems for
  electric and hybrid electric vehicle drive trains.

  While flywheels have been used for centuries, practical, compact systems are a
  recent development. Their arrival coincides with the commercial availability
  of high-strength-to-weight composite materials, high energy permanent magnets,
  extremely efficient switching power supplies, and active electromagnetic
  bearings.

  During 1996, the Company made internal research and development investments in
  this technology by designing and building an alpha demonstration unit of its
  Inertial Battery 20C1000 series flywheel energy storage system for
  uninterruptible power supply applications for the telecommunications market.

  Motors and High Speed Drives

  SatCon designs and builds high-performance motors and drives that capitalize
  on advances in materials and semiconductor technology to achieve high power
  density. SatCon designs are characterized by power densities as high as 7
  hp/lb for the motors and 25 hp/lb for the drive electronics. Through the use
  of high-performance materials and careful design of the magnetic circuits,
  SatCon has demonstrated electric motor prototypes that are light weight and
  have provided efficiencies in excess of 97 percent.  SatCon's motor designs
  are being evaluated for a wide variety of applications including electric
  vehicles, shipboard motors and general industrial applications.

  During 1996, the Company made internal research and development investments in
  this product area by developing and demonstrating an advanced automotive
  alternator that can provide more power at lower speeds.  The issue with
  current automotive alternators is the ability to match power requirements at
  idle speeds.  By addressing key limitations of current alternators, SatCon is
  attempting to enter the automotive alternator market.

  Power Electronics

  SatCon has developed proprietary, custom-built high-voltage hybrid modules
  based on advanced power semiconductor technology at a fraction of the weight
  of conventional packages.  The high-density topology and innovative cooling
  schemes utilized allow for higher throughput in smaller, lighter weight
  packages.  These electronics support SatCon's high-speed drive and flywheel
  product development.  This high-density topology and innovative cooling scheme
  has created power throughput in excess of 1 Megawatt in a 65-pound package.

  Magnetic Bearings and Suspension Systems

  Improvements in magnetic materials and electronic control systems have led the
  way to advances in electromagnetic bearings and suspension systems. SatCon has
  participated in the development of such systems for spacecraft and ground-
  based systems. SatCon's magnetic bearing systems feature innovative
  electromagnetic and permanent magnet actuators and advance digital control
  systems. These systems have been developed for both commercial and military
  applications.

  By injecting electromagnetic forces along a selected bearing axis in concert
  with shaft rotation, the magnetic bearings can balance a dynamic machine,
  resulting in smooth and quiet operation. Similar principles guide the
  application of electromagnetic suspension systems. These automated systems
  provide a significant reduction of structure-borne vibration transmittal,
  providing either low-vibration machinery operation, low detection, or
  vibration isolation.  In addition, these systems provide lubrication-free
  support for rotating, reciprocating, and stationary systems.  Also, through
  active electronic control, these systems provide quiet, smooth, and non-
  contaminating machinery operation and isolation.

  During 1996, the Company made internal investments in this product area by
  building several beta site units of its magnetic actuation system for
  semiconductor processing that can eliminate unwanted debris, provide higher
  throughput potential, and is more easily maintained than existing mechanical
  systems.  This entry into the semiconductor processing equipment market may
  represent SatCon's first step toward realizing the market potential for
  electro-mechanical actuation systems.

  Propulsion Systems

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
  SatCon is developing commercial prototype prime propulsion and auxiliary power
  units that combine advanced gas turbine drives with high-speed electrical
  alternators. The result is compact, lightweight electrical power generation
  that can operate on a variety of fuels. This system, called the Turbine
  Alternator Unit ("TAU"), integrates a high-speed gas turbine and a highly
  efficient, high-frequency AC induction alternator on the same shaft. With
  innovative electrical, structural and thermal design, a TAU can operate at
  high speeds, resulting in high power output with reduced system size.

  These Turbine-Alternators, which are appropriate for a wide variety of primary
  or auxiliary power applications, are expected to operate on a variety of fuels
  and to offer attractive power-to-weight benefits compared to conventional
  power generation options.

  MARKETING/MARKETS

  SatCon's objective is to capitalize on the technology developments from its
  internal and contract research and development to be a leading supplier of a
  new generation of intelligent, electro-mechanical products for aerospace,
  transportation, industrial, and utility applications. These products, spawned
  by a revolution in the size, weight and efficiency of machines, provide
  competitive advantages in performance. Management believes the following list
  to be representative of market opportunities as they exist today for the
  Company's products.

  Flywheel Energy Storage ("FES") Systems:  Electromechanical storage in
  SatCon's flywheel energy storage systems may replace batteries in a variety of
  industries including uninterruptible power supplies for telecommunications
  providers and industrial systems, power quality for utilities, and integrated
  power and attitude control for satellites.

  Motors and High Speed Drives:  Management believes that SatCon's electric
  motors, generators, and drives may offer advantages to a variety of industries
  including automotive components, vehicle propulsion systems, industrial
  drives, machine tools, satellites and consumer products.

  Power Electronics:  Lightweight, high power density electronics may offer
  advantages to several markets and are key components in SatCon's system
  products including  motor and drive systems, electric and hybrid vehicles,
  aerospace, industrial controls and power management, and a variety of military
  subsystems.

  Magnetic Bearings and Suspension Systems:  SatCon's magnetic bearing and
  suspension systems have the potential to be applied to a variety of
  applications such as aircraft gas turbine engines, flywheel systems,
  compressors, high speed machine tools, vibration isolators and computer chip
  manufacturing processing equipment.

  Propulsion Systems:  Lightweight, low-cost, long-life turbine alternators may
  offer advantages for a variety of applications including hybrid vehicle
  primary propulsion, auxiliary power and portable power systems, and military
  vehicle propulsion and remote power supplies.

  COMPETITION

  The Company is aware of direct and indirect competitors which employ magnetics
  technology and have extensive research and development facilities in both
  government and commercial markets. The Company believes its principal
  competitors in government sponsored research and development include Aura
  Systems, Inc., American Flywheel, U.S. Flywheel, and Unique Mobility, Inc. The
  Company is aware of large companies, as well as smaller companies, entering
  this market and expects competition to intensify either through direct
  competition or via alternative technologies.

  Although the Company is not as well capitalized as some of its competitors and
  is more limited in terms of its facilities and number of personnel, its
  strategy is to compete with larger companies on the basis of its technical
  skills, proprietary know-how, access to university researchers in the greater
  Boston area conducting ongoing research, and key personnel, many of whom are
  experts in the field of magnetics technology.

  The industries served by the Company are highly competitive and a number of
  companies are involved in extensive research and development programs designed
  to address the technological challenges which the Company is seeking to
  address through its development programs. Many of these companies are larger
  and better financed than the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance
  that customers will not select technologies developed by or under development
  by other companies or that potential customers will select the 

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
  Company's technologies to address both existing and potential markets.
  Virtually all of the Company's revenues to date from commercial contracts have
  been derived in connection with prototype development contracts. As a result,
  the Company will need to develop technologies which address customers' needs
  in a cost-effective and timely manner. There can be no assurance that the
  Company will be successful in these efforts, that technologies developed by
  other companies will not be selected, or that potential customers for the
  Company's technologies will adopt the Company's technologies in a timely
  manner, if at all.

  PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

  The Company currently owns nine United States patents which expire between
  2007 and 2013.  The Company has twelve patent applications pending with the
  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

  As a qualifying small business, the Company has retained commercial ownership
  rights to proprietary technology developed under various U.S. Government
  contracts and grants, including Small Business Innovation Research ("SBIR")
  contracts.

  In addition to its patent rights, the Company also relies upon treatment of
  its technology as trade secrets and upon confidentiality agreements, which all
  of its employees are required to execute, assigning to the Company all patent
  rights and technical or other information developed by the employees during
  their employment with the Company. The Company's employees have also agreed
  not to disclose any trade secret or confidential information without the prior
  written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding these confidentiality
  agreements, there can be no assurances that other companies will not acquire
  information which the Company considers to be proprietary. Moreover, while the
  Company intends to defend vigorously its patents against infringement by third
  parties, there can be no assurance that the Company's patents will be
  enforceable or provide the Company with meaningful protection from competitors
  or that patent applications will be allowed. No assurance can be given as to
  the issuance of additional patents or, if so issued, as to their scope.
  Patents granted may not provide meaningful protection from competitors. Even
  if a competitor's products were to infringe patents owned by the Company, it
  would be very costly for the Company to pursue its rights in an enforcement
  action, which would also divert funds and resources which otherwise could be
  used in the Company's operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that
  the Company would be successful in enforcing intellectual property rights or
  that the Company may not infringe patent or intellectual property rights of
  third parties, although the Company, to date, has not been required to defend
  its patents or proprietary information against claims by third parties.

  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

  All of the Company's revenues during Fiscal year 1996 are attributable to
  research and development activities funded by commercial customers and U.S.
  Government agency sponsors.  Under the agreements funded by the U.S.
  Government, the government retains a royalty-free license to use the
  technology developed for government purposes and the Company retains exclusive
  rights to the technology for commercial and industrial applications.  In
  addition to the research and development conducted under contract, the Company
  expended $893,628 on internally funded research and development in 1996.  This
  is primarily related to continued development of drive train components for
  hybrid electric vehicles in the automotive industry as well as further
  development of flywheel energy storage systems for the cable industry.

  GOVERNMENT REGULATION

  The Company has entered into certain U.S. Government contracts which require
  compliance with applicable U.S. Government regulations. The Company's
  contracts with the U.S. Government consist primarily of research and
  development contracts, many of which are awarded under the SBIR Program. The
  research and development contracts are generally subject to competitive
  bidding and extensive regulation and are generally subject to cancellation at
  the U.S. Government's sole discretion. In addition, the Company has been
  awarded certain classified U.S. Government contracts. Certain of the Company's
  employees and directors have been required to obtain security clearance from
  the federal government.

  As a party to a number of contracts with the U.S. Government and its agencies,
  the Company must comply with extensive regulations, including regulations with
  respect to bid proposals and billing practices. As research and development
  contracts are generally subject to cancellation at the U.S. Government's sole
  discretion, should the 

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
  U.S. Government or its agencies conclude that the Company has not adhered to
  federal regulations, any contracts to which the Company is a party could be
  canceled and/or could prohibit the Company from bidding on future contracts,
  which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. All payments to the
  Company for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government
  are subject to adjustment upon audit by the U.S. Government Defense Contract
  Audit Agency, the General Accounting Office, and other agencies. The Company
  could be required to disgorge any payments received from U.S. Government
  agencies if it is found to have violated federal regulations.

  The commercialization of the Company's technologies for use in various
  industries may also be affected by federal and state legislative and
  regulatory changes affecting such industries.

  MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLIERS

  To date, the Company has manufactured all of its prototype products at its
  facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Company anticipates investing in
  manufacturing equipment to further develop the manufacturing capabilities at
  this facility. If the Company is successful in obtaining market penetration of
  its products, the Company will be required to deliver large volumes of quality
  products or components to its customers on a timely basis at reasonable costs
  to the Company. The Company intends to seek to supplement its manufacturing
  capabilities by establishing relationships with manufacturing organizations to
  deliver large volumes of its products until such time as the Company can
  develop its own manufacturing expertise and capacity.  No assurance can be
  given that the Company will be able to successfully establish relationships
  with third party manufacturing organizations, or if such relationships are
  established, that they will be successful.

  The principal materials and supplies used by the Company are available from
  several commercial sources, and the Company does not depend on any single
  source for a significant portion of its materials or supplies. Component parts
  of the Company's active control systems are readily available.

  BACKLOG

  The Company's backlog consists primarily of research and development
  contracts.  At September 30, 1996, the backlog was approximately $7,400,000
  for work to be performed in the Fiscal year ending September 30, 1997.  Many
  of the Company's contracts may be canceled at any time with limited or no
  penalty.  Also, contract awards may be subject to funding approval from the
  U.S. Government and commercial entities, which  involves political, budgetary,
  and other considerations over which the Company has no control. The Company's
  backlog at September 30, 1995 was approximately $10,000,000.  At September 30,
  1996, the Company also had $10,000,000 in conditional purchase orders and

  ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  INTRODUCTION

  SatCon Technology Corporation (the "Company" or "SatCon") was organized as a
  Massachusetts corporation in February 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in
  1992. SatCon designs, develops, and manufactures intelligent, electro-
  mechanical products for aerospace, transportation, industrial, and utility
  applications. SatCon's electro-mechanical products are being developed for a
  wide variety of U.S. government and commercial markets. For the government,
  SatCon's electro-mechanical systems provide low vibration and high power for
  applications ranging from satellite attitude control to high speed drives for
  shipboard systems. In the transportation segment, SatCon is developing
  electric and hybrid electric drive components, auxiliary power units, and
  advanced steering, suspension, and braking systems. SatCon is working with
  major equipment producers to develop process equipment drives, high speed and
  precision machine tools, manipulators, and machinery isolation equipment.
  SatCon's electro-mechanical systems may offer to the utility industry
  advantages in power generation, energy storage, and power quality. In the
  consumer market, SatCon is developing freon-free compressors for
  refrigerators, variable speed motors, and other long-life, high-efficiency
  machinery.

  It is the Company's strategy to accelerate leading edge developments by
  continuing to expand its externally funded contract research and development
  from both government and commercial sources. The Company can then leverage
  this funding to develop products which the Company believes can both be sold
  to government agencies and transition into high volume commercial products.
  Recent changes in the Small Business Innovative Research program provide a new
  mechanism to pursue government Phase III pre-production programs on a sole
  source non-competitive basis. In most instances, individual components have
  multiple applications across these markets.

  This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. For this
  purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical
  fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the
  foregoing, the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects" and

  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1996 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1995

 
  Revenues.  The Company's revenues decreased $2,090,839, or 18.2%, from 1995 to
  1996. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in revenue of approximately
  $3,945,253 from contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of
  drive train components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  During
  the year, Chrysler Corporation announced the cancellation of the Patriot
  Hybrid Vehicle Program. Chrysler has announced that it intends to transition
  technologies utilized in the Patriot Program to their Hybrid Electric Vehicle
  (HEV) program being sponsored by the U.S. Government's Super Car Initiative.
  The Company expects involvement with Chrysler in this effort; however as of
  December 20, 1996, no contractual agreement has been entered between SatCon
  and Chrysler Corporation relating to the HEV program.  The Company can give no
  assurance that it will receive additional work related to the HEV program.
  The Company has not to date recorded any revenues associated with the Chrysler
  HEV Program. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by increased
  revenues of approximately $2,355,000 related to work on various government
  development contracts.

  Cost of Sales.  Cost of sales decreased $2,582,094, or 39.5%, from 1995 to
  1996.  The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in work during 1996 on
  contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of drive train
  components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  As a percentage of
  revenue, cost of sales decreased from 56.8% for 1995 to 42.0.% for 1996. The
  decrease in cost of sales, as a percent of revenue, was primarily due to a
  decrease in direct material and subcontract costs and an increase in direct
  labor costs directly related to the shift from work on the Chrysler Patriot
  Program, which had high material costs, as a percentage of revenue, to work on
  several labor intensive research and development contracts funded by the U.S
  Government which typically have higher margins.

  Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative
  expenses increased $2,540,247, or 46.3%, from 1995 to 1996, a change as a
  percentage of revenue from 47.8% in 1995 to 85.5% in 1996. Approximately
  $500,000 is attributable to the establishment of the Company's Space Division
  in Tucson, Arizona. Approximately $600,000 was expensed in establishing the
  Company's Flywheel Energy Storage Division. Cambridge facilities expense
  increased approximately $277,000 due to the exercise of an option in the
  Company's lease for additional space. The Company now occupies the entire
  building at 161 First Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Depreciation expense
  increased approximately $373,000 due to purchases of computer, laboratory,
  inspection, test, and manufacturing equipment during fiscal 1995 and 1996.
  Marketing expenses increased approximately $500,000 in efforts to broaden the
  customer base in anticipation of the cancellation of the Patriot Program.

  Research and Development.  Research and development expenses decreased
  $1,043,613, or 53.9% from 1995 to 1996.  As a percentage of revenue, internal
  research and development decreased from 16.9% in 1995 to 9.5% in 1996.  The
  decrease in research and development spending is primarily the result of a
  reallocation of engineering resources from internally funded research and
  development to construction of a pre-production flywheel, additional marketing
  efforts and development efforts on contracts from the U.S. Government and
  commercial contracts.  Virtually all of 1996 revenues were for sponsored
  research and development.  As a small business under government contracts,
  SatCon retains commercial rights to work developed.  For commercial contracts,
  intellectual property is negotiated on a case-by-case basis.

  Net Income/(Loss).  As a result of decreased revenues and increased investment
  in marketing, facilities, and associated fringe costs,  the Company realized a
  net loss of $2,864,836 in 1996 versus a net loss of $1,210,045 in 1995.


  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1995 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1994

  Revenues.  The Company's revenues decreased $6,541,560, or 36.3%, from 1994 to
  1995. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in revenue of approximately
  $5,700,000 from contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of
  drive train components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  During
  the year, performance testing began of first generation drive train components
  to identify possible design improvements to be incorporated in subsequent
  units.  This testing resulted in a delay in revenue from 

                                      12

<PAGE>
 
  the Patriot Program. At the close of the fiscal year the Company continued to
  support Chrysler in these test and design improvement efforts on a time and
  materials basis. In addition, the company realized a decrease in revenue of
  approximately $2,700,000, due to the completion of a contract with Itek
  Optical Systems for design work for a U.S. Government program. These decreases
  in revenue were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately
  $1,800,000 related to work on various commercial and government development
  contracts.

  Cost of Sales.  Cost of sales decreased $4,758,471, or 42.2%, from 1994 to
  1995.  The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in work during 1995 on
  contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of drive train
  components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  As a percentage of
  revenue, cost of sales decreased from 62.6% for 1994 to 56.8% for 1995. The
  decrease in cost of sales as a percent of revenue was primarily due to a
  decrease in direct material and subcontract costs as a percentage of cost of
  sales related to a shift in efforts on the Patriot Program from material
  procurement and subcontract production to assembly and test of first
  generation drive train components.  This decrease is partially offset by an
  increase in material procurement and subcontract production cost for long lead
  time parts for second generation drive train components for the Patriot
  Program.

  Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative
  expenses increased $827,425, or 17.8%, from 1994 to 1995, a change as a
  percentage of revenue from 25.8% in 1994 to 47.8% in 1995.  This increase is
  primarily the result of the addition of business support personnel (marketing,
  engineering, and administrative) added to support the Company's transition to
  a supplier of products to commercial markets.  This increase was partially
  offset by a decrease in costs related to contract employees and consultants
  replaced by permanent employees.  In addition, depreciation expense increased
  primarily due to the purchases of computer, laboratory, inspection and test,
  and manufacturing equipment during fiscal year 1994 and 1995.

  Research and Development.  Research and development expenses increased
  $1,476,173, or 320.2% from 1994 to 1995.  As a percentage of revenue, internal
  research and development increased from 2.6% in 1994 to 16.9% in 1995.  The
  increase in expenditures is primarily associated with projects to develop
  technology for products for the automotive and other commercial markets. The
  majority of the increase is associated with projects related to the develop of
  three pre-production prototype systems.  The systems developed and built
  include a flywheel energy storage system aimed at stationary uninterruptable
  power supply markets, an advanced replacement alternator for automotive
  applications, and an advanced actuation system for semiconductor processing
  equipment. The Company continues to increase efforts in the pursuit of
  commercial product opportunities capitalizing on the Company's Active Motion
  Control technology base.

  Net Income/(Loss).  As a result of decreased revenues and increased selling,
  general and administrative and research and development expenses, the Company
  realized a net loss of $1,210,045 in 1995 versus a net income of $1,224,892 in
  1994.

  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

  The Company's cash and cash equivalents was $3,770,925 as of September 30,
  1996, an increase of $1,582,938 from September 30, 1995.  Cash used in
  operating activities was $3,072,434 during 1996, as compared to cash provided
  by operating activities of $5,751,991 during 1995. The cash used in operations
  was primarily the result of a net increase of approximately $972,675 in
  accounts receivable and unbilled contract costs due primarily to extended
  billing and payment terms with two commercial customers.  The remainder of the
  cash used by operating activities is primarily a result of an increase in
  other assets, a decrease in prepaid expenses, an increase in accrued expenses
  and payroll, and the net loss net of income tax benefit for the period.

  Cash provided by investing activities as of September 30, 1996, was
  $4,450,724. The cash provided relates primarily to the sale and maturity of
  approximately $8,407,185 of marketable securities to fund operations prior to
  collection of outstanding invoices.  The cash provided was partially offset by
  purchases of marketable securities of approximately $1,450,000  and capital
  expenditures of approximately $2,293,305.  The capital expenditures primarily
  relate to the purchase of inspection equipment, furniture and fixtures,
  leasehold improvements, computer equipment, and sales and demonstration
  equipment.

  The Company has a $3,000,000 bank line of credit. Borrowings under the line
  will be unsecured and charged interest at prime rate.  The line of credit
  expires January 31, 1997.  The Company has entered into negotiations to
  replace this line of credit.  No funds have as yet been advanced under this
  facility.  The Company is required to maintain certain covenants including
  certain financial ratios as described in the line of credit agreement.

  The Company anticipates that its existing cash resources, cash flow from
  operations and the continued availability of its bank line of credit will be
  sufficient to fund its operations through September 30, 1997, provided it
  meets its operating plan and remains in compliance with its credit agreement,
  although no funds have as yet been advanced.  The Company is currently in
  default of its line of credit facility with the bank. However, the Company has
  received a written waiver of this default for the year ended September 30,
  1996. The Company's ability to finance its operations will be dependent on its
  ability to renegotiate its bank line of credit for a continued availability of
  borrowing thereunder. There can be no assurance that the Company will be
  successful in renegotiating its line of credit. To the extent cash flow from
  operations is insufficient to fund the Company's activities, it may be
  necessary to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. The
  Company's ability to generate cash from operations depends upon, among other
  things, revenue growth, its credit and payments terms with vendors, and
  collections of accounts receivable. The Company's ability to borrow under this
  facility is dependent upon satisfying certain financial covenants, among other
  things, and there can be no assurances that the Company will remain in
  compliance. If such sources of cash prove insufficient, the Company will be
  required to make changes in its operations or to seek additional debt or
  equity financing. There can be no assurances that cash generated from
  operations and borrowings under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet
  its operating requirements, or if required, that additional debt or equity
  financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.

  FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS

  The Company's future results remain difficult to predict and may be affected
  by a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially
  from the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form
  10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. These factors
  include business conditions within the automotive, telecommunications,
  industrial machinery and semiconductor industries and the world economies as a
  whole, and competitive pressures that may impact research and development
  spending. The Company's revenue growth is dependent on technology developments
  and contract research and development for both the government and commercial
  sectors and no assurance can be given that such investments will continue or
  that the Company can successfully obtain such funds. In addition, the
  Company's future growth opportunities are dependent on the introduction on new
  products that must penetrate automotive, telecommunications, industrial, and
  computer market segments. No assurance can be given that new products can be
  developed, or if developed, will be successful; that competitors will not
  force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from the
  Company; or that the Company can achieve or maintain profits in these markets.
  Because of these and other factors, past financial performances should not be
  considered an indicator of future performance. Investors should not use
  historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the
  Company's stock price frequently experiences significant volatility.

  EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

  In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123,
  "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which encourages companies to
  recognize compensation expense in the income statement based on the fair value
  of the underlying common stock at the date the awards are granted .  However,
  it will permit continued accounting under APB Opinion 25, "Accounting for
  Stock Issued to Employees," accompanied by a disclosure of the pro forma
  effects on net income and earnings per share had the new accounting rules been
  applied. The statement is effective for Fiscal 1997. The Company plans to
  account for stock based compensation in accordance with APB Opinion 25.


  EFFECTS OF INFLATION

  The Company believes that inflation over the past three years has not had a
  significant impact on the Company's sales or operating results.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


     We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and financial statement
schedule of SatCon Technology Corporation as of September 30, 1996 and 1995, and
the related statements of operations, changes in stockholder's equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1996. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of SatCon Technology
Corporation as of September 30, 1996 and 1995, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,
1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be
included therein.

                         Notes to Financial Statements
  

  A. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

  Organization

  SatCon Technology Corporation (the "Company" or "SatCon") was organized as a
  Massachusetts corporation in February 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in
  1992. SatCon designs, develops and manufactures intelligent, electro-
  mechanical products for aerospace, transportation, industrial, and utility
  applications. SatCon's electro-mechanical products are being developed for a
  wide variety of U.S. government and commercial markets. For the government,
  SatCon's electro-mechanical systems provide low vibration and high power for
  applications ranging from satellite attitude control to high speed drives for
  shipboard systems. In the transportation segment SatCon is developing electric
  and hybrid electric drive components, auxiliary power units, and advanced
  steering, suspension, and braking systems. SatCon is working with major
  equipment producers to develop process equipment drives, high speed and
  precision machine tools, manipulators, and machinery isolation equipment.
  SatCon's electro-mechanical systems may offer to the utility industry
  advantages in power generation, energy storage, and power quality. In the
  consumer market SatCon is developing freon-free compressors for refrigerators,
  variable speed motors, and other long-life, high-efficiency machinery.


  It is the Company's strategy to accelerate leading edge developments by
  continuing to expand its externally funded contract research and development
  from both government and commercial sources. The Company can then leverage
  this funding to develop products which the Company believes can both be sold
  to government agencies transition into high volume commercial products. Recent
  changes in the Small Business Innovative Research program provide a new
  mechanism to pursue government Phase III preproduction programs on a sole
  source non-competitive basis. In most instances, individual components have
  multiple applications across these markets.

  Revenue Recognition

  The Company performs research under cost type, fixed price, and time and
  material contracts and sells product prototypes.  Revenue is recognized on the
  percentage-of-completion method based on the proportion of costs incurred to
  total estimated costs for each contract.  Revenues recognized in excess of
  amounts billed are classified in current assets as unbilled contract costs.
  Certain contracts contain provisions for performance incentives.  Such
  incentives are included in revenues when realization is assured.  If a current
  contract estimate indicates a loss, a provision is made for the total
  anticipated loss.

  All payments to the Company for work performed on contracts with agencies of
  the U.S. Government are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense
  Contract Audit Agency.  Adjustments are recognized in the period made.

                                      22

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and highly
  liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when acquired.  At
  September 30, 1996, $67,632 of cash and cash equivalents is reserved as
  collateral for a letter of credit drawn for the deposit on a facility lease.

  Marketable Securities

  The Company accounts for marketable securities in accordance with the
  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (SFAS 115), "Accounting
  for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."

  Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in
  debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at
  each balance sheet date.  Debt securities for which the Company does not have
  the intent or ability to hold to maturity are classified as available for
  sale.  Securities available for sale are carried at fair value, based on
  quoted market prices, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax,
  reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity except for unrealized
  losses determined to be permanent in nature.  Such unrealized losses are
  included in the determination of net income in the period in which management
  determines the decline to be permanent.  The Company is not actively involved
  in the purchase and sale of investments classified as trading.  At September
  30, 1996, the Company had no investments that qualified as trading or held to
  maturity.

     The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available for sale is
  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity
  or, in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the
  security.  Such amortization and interest are included in interest income.
  Realized gains and losses are included in other income or expense.  The cost
  of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

  Property and Equipment

  Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed using the
  straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life.  Effective
  October 1, 1994 the estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as
  follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                                             ESTIMATED LIVES
                                                            -------------------
          <S>                                                <C>
          Computer equipment and software..................       3 Years
          Electronic laboratory and shop equipment.........       5 Years
          Mechanical laboratory and shop equipment.........      10 Years
          Sales and demonstration equipment................    3 - 10 Years
          Furniture and fixtures...........................      10 Years  
          Leasehold improvements...........................  Lesser of the life
                                                             of the lease or the
                                                             useful life of the
                                                             improvement
</TABLE>

  Previously, the estimated useful lives of property and equipment were three
  years.  These changes were made to better reflect the estimated periods during
  which such assets will remain in service.

  When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related
  depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any
  resulting gain or loss is reflected in other income.

  Intangibles

  The Company periodically reviews the propriety of carrying amounts of its
  intangible assets as well as the amortization periods to determine whether
  current events and circumstances warrant adjustment to the carrying value or
  estimated useful lives.  At each balance sheet date, management evaluates
  whether there has been a permanent impairment in the value of intangibles by
  assessing the carrying value of intangibles 

                                       23
<PAGE>
 
  against anticipated future cash flows from related operating activities.
  Factors which management considers in performing this assessment include
  current operating results, trends and prospects and, in addition, demand,
  competetion and other economic factors.

  Other intangibles, which consist of patents and trademarks are being amortized
  on a straight-line basis over 7 years.

  Use of estimates

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
  accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
  and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements.
  Actual results could differ from these estimates.

  Income Taxes

  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with  Financial Accounting
  Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109), which requires a
  balance sheet approach for accounting for income taxes.  Under SFAS 109,
  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on
  temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities using
  statutory rates.  The Company has, as required under the Internal Revenue
  Code, switched from the cash to accrual method for tax reporting purposes.

  Earnings/(loss) Per Common and Common Equivalent Share

  Earnings/(loss) per common and common equivalent share is based upon the
  weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year,
  adjusted to include the dilutive effects of stock options and warrants.  For
  the current year ended September 30, 1996 common share equivalents have not
  been included because their effect would have been antidilutive.  For all
  periods presented, fully diluted earnings per share is not materially
  different from primary earnings per share.

  Concentration of Credit Risk

  Financial instruments which subject the Company to concentrations of credit
  risk consist principally of cash equivalents, investments in marketable
  securities, trade accounts receivable, and unbilled contract costs.

  The Company's trade accounts receivable and unbilled contract costs are
  primarily from sales to U.S. Government agencies and two commercial customers.
  The Company does not require collateral and has not historically experienced
  significant credit losses related to receivables or unbilled contract costs
  from individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or
  geographic area.

  The Company deposits its cash and invests in short-term investments and
  marketable securities primarily through one regional commercial bank and one
  investment company.  Credit exposure to any one entity is limited by Company
  policy.

  Reclassifications

  Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to current year
  presentations.


  B.    MARKETABLE SECURITIES

  At September 30, 1996, debt securities have been categorized as available for
  sale and as a result are stated at fair value.

  $9,352,991 and $8,601,334 for federal and state income tax purposes,
  respectively, of which $949,568 relates to deductions attributable to the

  losses expire beginning September 30, 2006 through 2011. The state net

  Research and experimental credit carryforward at September 30, 1996 was
  $169,837 for federal income tax purposes.


  I.    STOCK OPTIONS

  Under the Company's 1986 Stock Option Plan, both qualified and nonqualified
  stock options may be granted to certain officers and key employees. Options
  under the 1986 Plan become exercisable as vested over four years, and expire
  December 31, 1996.  At September 30, 1996 and 1995, all of the 553,196 stock
  options available for grant under the Company's 1986 Stock Option Plan had
  been granted.

  In June 1992, the Company adopted its 1992 Stock Option Plan which provides
  for the grant to employees, officers, directors and consultants of qualified
  and nonqualified stock options to purchase up to 450,000 shares of the
  Company's Common Stock.  At September 30, 1996 and 1995, 440,866 and 447,196,
  respectively, of the 450,000 stock options available for grant under the
  Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan had been granted.

  In February 1994, the Company adopted its 1994 Stock Option Plan which was
  subsequently adopted by the Company's stockholders in June 1994. The Plan
  provides for the grant to employees, officers, directors, and consultants of
  qualified and nonqualified stock options to purchase up to 300,000 shares of
  the Company's Common Stock. At September 30, 1996 and 1995, 277,092 and
  276,100, respectively, of the 300,000 stock options available for grant under
  the Company's 1994 Stock Option Plan had been granted.

  During fiscal year 1996, the Company adopted its 1996 Stock Option Plan which
  provides for the grant to employees, officers, directors, and consultants of
  qualified and non qualified stock options to purchase up to 300,000 shares of
  the Company's Common Stock. At September 30, 1996, none of the 300,000 stock
  options available for grant under the Company's 1996 Stock Option Plan had
  been granted.

  The 1986, 1992, 1994, and 1996 Stock Option Plans (collectively the "Plans")
  are subject to the following provisions:

  The aggregate fair market value (determined as of the date the option is
  granted) of the Common Stock that any employee may purchase in any calendar
  year pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options may not exceed
  $100,000. No person who owns, directly or indirectly, at the time of the
  granting of an incentive stock option to him or her, more than 10% of the
  total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company shall be
  eligible to receive any incentive stock options under the Plans unless the

                                      28

<PAGE>
 
  option price is at least 110% of the fair market value of the Common Stock
  subject to the option, determined on the date of grant. Nonqualified options
  are not subject to this limitation.

  Incentive stock options are issuable only to employees of the Company, while
  nonqualified options may be issued to nonemployee directors, consultants, and
  others, as well as to employees of the Company. Options granted under the
  Stock Option Plans may not be granted with an exercise price less than 100% of
  fair value of the Company's Common Stock, as determined by the Board of
  Directors on the grant date.

  Options under the Plans must be granted within 10 years from the effective
  date of the Plan. Incentive stock options granted under the Plans cannot be
  exercised more than 10 years from the date of grant except that incentive
  stock options issued to 10% or greater stockholders are limited to five year
  terms. All options granted under the Plans provide for the payment of the
  Company's exercise price in cash, or by delivery to the Company of shares of
  Common Stock already owned by the optionee having fair market value equal to
  the exercise price of the options being exercised, or by a combination of such
  methods of payment. Therefore, an optionee may be able to tender shares of
  Common Stock to purchase additional shares of Common Stock and may
  theoretically exercise all of his stock options with no additional investment
  other than his original shares.

  The Plans contain antidilution provisions authorizing appropriate adjustments
  in certain circumstances. Shares of Common Stock subject to options which
  expire without being exercised or which are canceled as a result of the
  cessation of employment are available for further grants.


  The following is a summary of stock option activity:

  All outstanding option vest at various rates over periods up to four years and
  expire at various dates from December 31, 1996 to December 26, 2005.

  In addition to options granted pursuant to the Plans, the Company in March
  1992 issued non-qualified options to purchase up to 33,500 shares of Common
  Stock to certain of its professional advisors. These options are exercisable
  at a price of $5.25 per share and expire in March 1997. At September 30, 1996,
  21,110 options had been exercised.
  
  In connection with its initial public offering in November 1992, the Company
  also issued to the underwriter warrants to purchase up to (i) 150,000 shares
  of Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.25 per share and (ii) 150,000
  shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.55 per share. At September
  30, 1996, none of these warrants had been exercised.

  The Company is authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
  $.01 par value. The Preferred Stock may be issued in one or more series, the
  terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Board of
  Directors, without further action by stockholders, and may include voting
  rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters),
  preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights
  and sinking fund provisions. No Preferred Stock is currently outstanding and
  the Company has no present plans for the issuance thereof. However, the
  issuance of any such preferred Stock could affect the rights of the holders of
  Common Stock, and therefore, reduce the value of the Common Stock. In
  particular, specific rights granted to future holders of Preferred Stock could
  be used to restrict the Company's ability to merge with or sell its assets to
  a third party, thereby preserving control of the Company by present owners.


  K.    RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS

  In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123,
  "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which encourages companies to
  recognize compensation expense in the income statement based on the fair value
  of the underlying common stock at the date the awards are granted . However,
  it will permit continued accounting under APB Opinion 25, "Accounting for
  Stock Issued to Employees," accompanied by a disclosure of the pro forma
  effects on net income and earnings per share had the new accounting rules been
  applied. The statement is effective for fiscal year 1997. The Company plans to
  account for stock based compensation in accordance with APB Opinion 25.

                                                                   EXHIBIT 10.10

                         SATCON TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION

                            1996 STOCK OPTION PLAN

                                April 29, 1996


1.   Purpose. 
     -------

     The purpose of this plan (the "Plan") is to secure for SatCon Technology
Corporation (the "Company") and its shareholders the benefits arising from
capital stock ownership by employees, officers and directors of, and consultants
or advisors to, the Company and its parent and subsidiary corporations who are
expected to contribute to the Company's future growth and success. Except where
the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" shall include the parent and
all present and future subsidiaries of the Company as defined in Sections 424(e)
and 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or replaced from
time to time (the "Code"). Those provisions of the Plan which make express
reference to Section 422 shall apply only to Incentive Stock Options (as that
term is defined in the Plan).

2.   Type of Options and Administration. 
     ----------------------------------

     (a)  Types of Options.  Options granted pursuant to the Plan may be either
          ----------------
incentive stock options ("Incentive Stock Options") meeting the requirements of
Section 422 of the Code or Non-Statutory Options which are not intended to meet
the requirements of Section 422 of the Code ("Non-Statutory Options").

     (b)  Administration.  
          --------------

          (i)  The Plan will be administered by the Board of Directors of the
Company, whose construction and interpretation of the terms and provisions of
the Plan shall be final and conclusive. The Board of Directors may in its sole
discretion grant options to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock
("Common Stock") and issue shares upon exercise of such options as provided in
the Plan. The Board shall have authority, subject to the express provisions of
the Plan, to construe the respective option agreements and the Plan, to
prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to
determine the terms and provisions of the respective option agreements, which
need not be identical, and to make all other determinations which are, in the
judgment of the Board of Directors, necessary or desirable for the
administration of the Plan. The Board of Directors may correct any defect,
supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any option
agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the
Plan into effect and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. No
director or person acting pursuant to authority
<PAGE>
 
delegated by the Board of Directors shall be liable for any action or
determination under the Plan made in good faith.

          (ii) The Board of Directors may, to the full extent permitted by or
consistent with applicable laws or regulations and Section 3(b) of this Plan
delegate any or all of its powers under the Plan to a committee (the
"Committee") appointed by the Board of Directors, and if the Committee is so
appointed all references to the Board of Directors in the Plan shall mean and
relate to such Committee.

     (c)  Applicability of Rule 16b-3.  Those provisions of the Plan which make
          ---------------------------
express reference to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the "Exchange Act"), or any successor rule ("Rule 16b-3"), or which are
required in order for certain option transactions to qualify for exemption under
Rule 16b-3, shall apply only to such persons as are required to file reports
under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (a "Reporting Person").

3.   Eligibility. 
     -----------

     (a)  General.  Options may be granted to persons who are, at the time of
          -------
grant, employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to, the
Company; provided, that the class of employees to whom Incentive Stock Options
         --------
may be granted shall be limited to all employees of the Company. A person who
has been granted an option may, if he or she is otherwise eligible, be granted
additional options if the Board of Directors shall so determine. Subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 15 below, the maximum number of shares with
respect to which options may be granted to any employee under the Plan shall not
exceed 100,000 shares of common stock during any calendar year. For the purpose
of calculating such maximum number, (a) an option shall continue to be treated
as outstanding notwithstanding its repricing, cancellation or expiration and (b)
the repricing of an outstanding option or the issuance of a new option in
substitution for a cancelled option shall be deemed to constitute the grant of a
new additional option separate from the original grant of the option that is
repriced or cancelled.

     (b)  Grant of Options to Directors and Officers.  From and after the
          ------------------------------------------
registration of the Common Stock of the Company under the Exchange Act, the
selection of a director or an officer (as the terms "director" and "officer" are
defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3) as a recipient of an option, the timing of
the option grant, the exercise price of the option and the number of shares
subject to the option shall be determined either (i) by the Board of Directors,
of which all members shall be "disinterested persons" (as hereinafter defined),
or (ii) by two or more directors having full authority to act in the matter,
each of whom shall be a "disinterested person." For the purposes of the Plan,
<PAGE>
 
a director shall be deemed to be a "disinterested person" only if such person
qualifies as a "disinterested person" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3, as such
term is interpreted from time to time.

4.   Stock Subject to Plan. 
     ---------------------

     Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15 below, the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock which may be issued and sold under the Plan is 300,000
shares. If an option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate for any
reason without having been exercised in full, the unpurchased shares subject to
such option shall again be available for subsequent option grants under the
Plan. If shares issued upon exercise of an option under the Plan are tendered to
the Company in payment of the exercise price of an option granted under the
Plan, such tendered shares shall again be available for subsequent option grants
under the Plan; provided, that in no event shall such shares be made available
for issuance to Reporting Persons or pursuant to exercise of Incentive Stock
Options.

5.   Forms of Option Agreements.  
     --------------------------

     As a condition to the grant of an option under the Plan, each recipient of
an option shall execute an option agreement in such form not inconsistent with
the Plan as may be approved by the Board of Directors. Such option agreements
may differ among recipients.

6.   Purchase Price. 
     --------------

     (a)  General.  Subject to Section 3(b), the purchase price per share of
          -------
stock deliverable upon the exercise of an option shall be determined by the
Board of Directors, provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock
                    --------  -------
Option, the exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value
of such stock, as determined by the Board of Directors, at the time of grant of
such option, or less than 110% of such fair market value in the case of options
described in Section 11(b).

     (b)  Payment of Purchase Price.  Options granted under the Plan may provide
          -------------------------
for the payment of the exercise price by delivery of cash or a check to the
order of the Company in an amount equal to the exercise price of such options,
or, to the extent provided in the applicable option agreement, (i) by delivery
to the Company of shares of Common Stock of the Company already owned by the
optionee having a fair market value equal in amount to the exercise price of the
options being exercised or (ii) by any other means (including, without
limitation, by delivery of a promissory note of the optionee payable on such
terms as are specified by the Board of Directors) which the Board of Directors
determines are consistent with the purpose of the Plan and with applicable laws
<PAGE>
 
and regulations (including, without limitation, the provisions of Regulation T
promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board). The fair market value of any shares
of the Company's Common Stock or other non-cash consideration which may be
delivered upon exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board of
Directors.

7.   Option Period. 
     -------------

     Each option and all rights thereunder shall expire on such date as shall be
set forth in the applicable option agreement, except that, in the case of an
Incentive Stock Option, such date shall not be later than ten years after the
date on which the option is granted and, in all cases, options shall be subject
to earlier termination as provided in the Plan.

8.   Exercise of Options. 
     -------------------

     Each option granted under the Plan shall be exercisable either in full or
in installments at such time or times and during such period as shall be set
forth in the agreement evidencing such option, subject to the provisions of the
Plan.

9.   Nontransferability of Options. 
     -----------------------------

     Options shall not be assignable or transferable by the person to whom they
are granted, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the
laws of descent and distribution, and, during the life of the optionee, shall be
exercisable only by the optionee; provided, however, that Non-Statutory Options
may be transferred pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order (as defined
in Rule 16b-3).

10.  Effect of Termination of Employment or Other Relationship.
     ---------------------------------------------------------

     Except as provided in Section 11(d) with respect to Incentive Stock
Options, and subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board of Directors shall
determine the period of time during which an optionee may exercise an option
following (i) the termination of the optionee's employment or other relationship
with the Company or (ii) the death or disability of the optionee. Such periods
shall be set forth in the agreement evidencing such option.

11.  Incentive Stock Options.
     -----------------------

     Options granted under the Plan which are intended to be Incentive Stock
Options shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions:
<PAGE>
 
     (a)  Express Designation.  All Incentive Stock Options granted under the
          -------------------
Plan shall, at the time of grant, be specifically designated as such in the
option agreement covering such Incentive Stock Options.

     (b)  10% Shareholder.  If any employee to whom an Incentive Stock Option is
          ---------------
to be granted under the Plan is, at the time of the grant of such option, the
owner of stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock of the Company (after taking into account the attribution
of stock ownership rules of Section 424(d) of the Code), then the following
special provisions shall be applicable to the Incentive Stock Option granted to
such individual:

          (i)    The purchase price per share of the Common Stock subject to
     such Incentive Stock Option shall not be less than 110% of the fair market
     value of one share of Common Stock at the time of grant; and

          (ii)   the option exercise period shall not exceed five years from the
     date of grant.

     (c)  Dollar Limitation.  For so long as the Code shall so provide, options
          -----------------
granted to any employee under the Plan (and any other incentive stock option
plans of the Company) which are intended to constitute Incentive Stock Options
shall not constitute Incentive Stock Options to the extent that such options, in
the aggregate, become exercisable for the first time in any one calendar year
for shares of Common Stock with an aggregate fair market value (determined as of
the respective date or dates of grant) of more than $100,000.

     (d)  Termination of Employment, Death or Disability.  No Incentive Stock
          ----------------------------------------------
Option may be exercised unless, at the time of such exercise, the optionee is,
and has been continuously since the date of grant of his or her option, employed
by the Company, except that:

          (i)    an Incentive Stock Option may be exercised within the period of
     three months after the date the optionee ceases to be an employee of the
     Company (or within such lesser period as may be specified in the applicable
     option agreement), provided, that the agreement with respect to such option
                        -------- 
     may designate a longer exercise period and that the exercise after such
     three-month period shall be treated as the exercise of a non-statutory
     option under the Plan;

          (ii)   if the optionee dies while in the employ of the Company, or
     within three months after the optionee ceases to be such an employee, the
     Incentive Stock Option may be exercised by the person to whom it is
     transferred by will or
<PAGE>
 
     the laws of descent and distribution within the period of one year after
     the date of death (or within such lesser period as may be specified in the
     applicable option agreement); and

          (iii)  if the optionee becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section
     22(e)(3) of the Code or any successor provision thereto) while in the
     employ of the Company, the Incentive Stock Option may be exercised within
     the period of one year after the date the optionee ceases to be such an
     employee because of such disability (or within such lesser period as may be
     specified in the applicable option agreement).

For all purposes of the Plan and any option granted hereunder, "employment"
shall be defined in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.421-7(h) of the
Income Tax Regulations (or any successor regulations). Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, no Incentive Stock Option may be exercised after its
expiration date.

12.  Additional Provisions.
     ---------------------

     (a)  Additional Option Provisions.  The Board of Directors may, in its sole
          ----------------------------
discretion, include additional provisions in option agreements covering options
granted under the Plan, including without limitation restrictions on transfer,
repurchase rights, commitments to pay cash bonuses, to make, arrange for or
guaranty loans or to transfer other property to optionees upon exercise of
options, or such other provisions as shall be determined by the Board of
Directors; provided that such additional provisions shall not be inconsistent
           -------- ----
with any other term or condition of the Plan and such additional provisions
shall not cause any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan to fail to
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code.

     (b)  Acceleration, Extension, Etc.  The Board of Directors may, in its sole
          ----------------------------
discretion, (i) accelerate the date or dates on which all or any particular
option or options granted under the Plan may be exercised or (ii) extend the
dates during which all, or any particular, option or options granted under the
Plan may be exercised.

13.  General Restrictions.
     --------------------

     (a)  Investment Representations.  The Company may require any person to
          --------------------------
whom an option is granted, as a condition of exercising such option, to give
written assurances in substance and form satisfactory to the Company to the
effect that such person is acquiring the Common Stock subject to the option for
his or her own account for investment and not with any present intention of
selling or otherwise distributing the same, and to such other effects as the
Company deems necessary or appropriate in order to
<PAGE>
 
comply with federal and applicable state securities laws, or with covenants or
representations made by the Company in connection with any public offering of
its Common Stock.

     (b)  Compliance With Securities Laws.  Each option shall be subject to the
          -------------------------------
requirement that if, at any time, counsel to the Company shall determine that
the listing, registration or qualification of the shares subject to such option
upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent
or approval of any governmental or regulatory body, or that the disclosure of
non-public information or the satisfaction of any other condition is necessary
as a condition of, or in connection with, the issuance or purchase of shares
thereunder, such option may not be exercised, in whole or in part, unless such
listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval, or satisfaction of
such condition shall have been effected or obtained on conditions acceptable to
the Board of Directors. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the Company to
apply for or to obtain such listing, registration or qualification, or to
satisfy such condition.

14.  Rights as a Shareholder.
     -----------------------

     The holder of an option shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect
to any shares covered by the option (including, without limitation, any rights
to receive dividends or non-cash distributions with respect to such shares)
until the date of issue of a stock certificate to him or her for such shares. No
adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date
is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued.

15.  Adjustment Provisions for Recapitalizations and Related Transactions.
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     (a)  General.  If, through or as a result of any merger, consolidation,
          -------
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split or other similar transaction, (i) the outstanding shares of Common Stock
are increased, decreased or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or other securities of the Company, or (ii) additional shares or new or
different shares or other securities of the Company or other non-cash assets are
distributed with respect to such shares of Common Stock or other securities, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment may be made in (x) the maximum number
and kind of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, (y) the number and kind
of shares or other securities subject to any then outstanding options under the
Plan, and (z) the price for each share subject to any then outstanding options
under the Plan, without changing the aggregate purchase price as to which such
options remain exercisable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
<PAGE>
 
adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 15 if such adjustment would
cause the Plan to fail to comply with Section 422 of the Code.

     (b)  Board Authority to Make Adjustments.  Any adjustments under this
          -----------------------------------
Section 15 will be made by the Board of Directors, whose determination as to
what adjustments, if any, will be made and the extent thereof will be final,
binding and conclusive. No fractional shares will be issued under the Plan on
account of any such adjustments.

16.  Merger, Consolidation, Asset Sale, Liquidation, etc.
     ---------------------------------------------------

     (a)  General.  In the event of a consolidation or merger or sale of all or
          -------
substantially all of the assets of the Company in which outstanding shares of
Common Stock are exchanged for securities, cash or other property of any other
corporation or business entity or in the event of a liquidation of the Company,
the Board of Directors of the Company, or the board of directors of any
corporation assuming the obligations of the Company, may, in its discretion,
take any one or more of the following actions, as to outstanding options: (i)
provide that such options shall be assumed, or equivalent options shall be
substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate
thereof), provided that any such options substituted for Incentive Stock Options
          --------
shall meet the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code, (ii) upon written
notice to the optionees, provide that all unexercised options will terminate
immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction unless exercised by
the optionee within a specified period following the date of such notice, (iii)
in the event of a merger under the terms of which holders of the Common Stock of
the Company will receive upon consummation thereof a cash payment for each share
surrendered in the merger (the "Merger Price"), make or provide for a cash
payment to the optionees equal to the difference between (A) the Merger Price
times the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such outstanding options
(to the extent then exercisable at prices not in excess of the Merger Price) and
(B) the aggregate exercise price of all such outstanding options in exchange for
the termination of such options, and (iv) provide that all or any outstanding
options shall become exercisable in full immediately prior to such event.

     (b)  Substitute Options.  The Company may grant options under the Plan in
          ------------------
substitution for options held by employees of another corporation who become
employees of the Company, or a subsidiary of the Company, as the result of a
merger or consolidation of the employing corporation with the Company or a
subsidiary of the Company, or as a result of the acquisition by the Company, or
one of its subsidiaries, of property or stock of the employing corporation. The
Company may direct that substitute options be
<PAGE>
 
granted on such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors considers
appropriate in the circumstances.

17.  No Special Employment Rights.
     ----------------------------

     Nothing contained in the Plan or in any option shall confer upon any
optionee any right with respect to the continuation of his or her employment by
the Company or interfere in any way with the right of the Company at any time to
terminate such employment or to increase or decrease the compensation of the
optionee.

18.  Other Employee Benefits.  
     -----------------------

     Except as to plans which by their terms include such amounts as
compensation, the amount of any compensation deemed to be received by an
employee as a result of the exercise of an option or the sale of shares received
upon such exercise will not constitute compensation with respect to which any
other employee benefits of such employee are determined, including, without
limitation, benefits under any bonus, pension, profit-sharing, life insurance or
salary continuation plan, except as otherwise specifically determined by the
Board of Directors.

19.  Amendment of the Plan.
     ---------------------

     (a)  The Board of Directors may at any time, and from time to time, modify
or amend the Plan in any respect, except that if at any time the approval of the
shareholders of the Company is required under Section 422 of the Code or any
successor provision with respect to Incentive Stock Options, or under Rule 16b-
3, the Board of Directors may not effect such modification or amendment without
such approval.

     (b)  The termination or any modification or amendment of the Plan shall
not, without the consent of an optionee, affect his or her rights under an
option previously granted to him or her. With the consent of the optionee
affected, the Board of Directors may amend outstanding option agreements in a
manner not inconsistent with the Plan. The Board of Directors shall have the
right to amend or modify (i) the terms and provisions of the Plan and of any
outstanding Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan to the extent
necessary to qualify any or all such options for such favorable federal income
tax treatment (including deferral of taxation upon exercise) as may be afforded
incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code and (ii) the terms and
provisions of the Plan and of any outstanding option to the extent necessary to
ensure the qualification of the Plan under Rule 16b-3.

20.  Withholding.
     -----------

     (a)  The Company shall have the right to deduct from payments of any kind
otherwise due to the optionee any federal, state or
<PAGE>
 
local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to any
shares issued upon exercise of options under the Plan. Subject to the prior
approval of the Company, which may be withheld by the Company in its sole
discretion, the optionee may elect to satisfy such obligations, in whole or in
part, (i) by causing the Company to withhold shares of Common Stock otherwise
issuable pursuant to the exercise of an option or (ii) by delivering to the
Company shares of Common Stock already owned by the optionee. The shares so
delivered or withheld shall have a fair market value equal to such withholding
obligation. The fair market value of the shares used to satisfy such withholding
obligation shall be determined by the Company as of the date that the amount of
tax to be withheld is to be determined. An optionee who has made an election
pursuant to this Section 20(a) may only satisfy his or her withholding
obligation with shares of Common Stock which are not subject to any repurchase,
forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting or other similar requirements.

     (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Reporting Person, no
election to use shares for the payment of withholding taxes shall be effective
unless made in compliance with any applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3 (unless
it is intended that the transaction not qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3).

21.  Cancellation and New Grant of Options, Etc.
     ------------------------------------------

     The Board of Directors shall have the authority to effect, at any time and
from time to time, with the consent of the affected optionees, (i) the
cancellation of any or all outstanding options under the Plan and the grant in
substitution therefor of new options under the Plan covering the same or
different numbers of shares of Common Stock and having an option exercise price
per share which may be lower or higher than the exercise price per share of the
cancelled options or (ii) the amendment of the terms of any and all outstanding
options under the Plan to provide an option exercise price per share which is
higher or lower than the then-current exercise price per share of such
outstanding options.

22.  Effective Date and Duration of the Plan.
     ---------------------------------------

     (a)  Effective Date.  The Plan shall become effective when adopted by the
          --------------
Board of Directors, but no option granted under the Plan shall become
exercisable unless and until the Plan shall have been approved by the Company's
shareholders. If such shareholder approval is not obtained within twelve months
after the date of the Board's adoption of the Plan, options previously granted
under the Plan shall not vest and shall terminate and no options shall be
granted thereafter. Amendments to the Plan not requiring shareholder approval
shall become effective when adopted by the Board of Directors; amendments
requiring shareholder approval (as provided in Section 19) shall become
effective when adopted by the
<PAGE>
 
Board of Directors, but no option granted after the date of such amendment shall
become exercisable (to the extent that such amendment to the Plan was required
to enable the Company to grant such option to a particular person) unless and
until such amendment shall have been approved by the Company's shareholders. If
such shareholder approval is not obtained within twelve months of the Board's
adoption of such amendment, any options granted on or after the date of such
amendment shall terminate to the extent that such amendment was required to
enable the Company to grant such option to a particular optionee. Subject to
this limitation, options may be granted under the Plan at any time after the
effective date and before the date fixed for termination of the Plan.

     (b)  Termination.  Unless sooner terminated in accordance with Section 16,
          -----------
the Plan shall terminate upon the close of business on the day next preceding
the tenth anniversary of the date of its adoption by the Board of Directors.
Options outstanding on such date shall continue to have force and effect in
accordance with the provisions of the instruments evidencing such options.

23.  Provision for Foreign Participants.
     ----------------------------------

     The Board of Directors may, without amending the Plan, modify awards or
options granted to participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside
the United States to recognize differences in laws, rules, regulations or
customs of such foreign jurisdictions with respect to tax, securities, currency,
employee benefit or other matters.

                                       Adopted by the Board of Directors on
                                       April 29, 1996.
