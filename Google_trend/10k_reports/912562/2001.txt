                         PART I

     Item 1. Description of Business

     General

     The Company is a processor of a broad array of high value-
     added, technically sophisticated steel and other metal
     products.  The Company utilizes any one or a combination of
     several different processes at each of its operating
     facilities to add substantial margin and value to raw
     material acquired from primary steel and other metal
     producers.  Underlying each of these processes is a common
     set of steel and metal processing core competencies.  These
     core competencies are the foundation upon which all the
     Company's operations and customer offerings are based.

     Industry Overview

     Steel and metal processors occupy a market niche that exists
     between the primary steel and metal producers and end-users
     and others.  Primary steel and metal producers typically
     focus on the sale of standard size and tolerance steel and
     other metals to large volume purchasers, including steel and
     metal processors.  At the same time, end-users require steel
     with closer tolerances and with shorter lead times than the
     primary steel and metal producers can provide efficiently.

     Metal Processes, Products and Services

     The Company processes, produces and delivers a variety of
     products and services on a just-in-time basis for industrial
     manufacturers, fabricators and other end-users in the
     automotive, automotive supply, building and construction,
     steel, machinery and fastener industries.

     The following table sets forth certain information regarding
     sales of products and services as a percentage
     of net sales for the past three years:
                                       Year ended December 31,

                                     2
<PAGE>
     The following steel and metal products, processes and
     services are provided by the Company:

     Cold-Rolled Strip Steel
     The Company produces a broad range of fully processed cold-
     rolled strip steel products.  The Company buys wide, open
     tolerance sheet steel in coils from primary steel producers and
     processes it to specific customer orders by performing such
     computer-aided processes as cold reduction, annealing, temper
     rolling, edge rolling and slitting.  Cold reduction is the
     rolling of steel to a specified thickness, tolerance and
     finish.  Annealing is a thermal process which changes hardness
     and certain metallurgical characteristics of steel.  Temper
     rolling is the rolling of steel to a specific hardness.  Edge
     rolling involves conditioning edges of processed steel into
     square, fully round or partially round shapes.  Slitting is the
     cutting of steel to specified widths.  Depending on customer
     specifications, one or more of these processes are utilized to
     produce steel strip of a precise grade, temper, tolerance and
     finish.

     The Company operates 9 rolling mills at its facilities in
     Cleveland, Ohio and Buffalo, New York, all of which are QS9000
     certified.  The Company has the capability to process coils up
     to a maximum of 72 inch outside diameter and roll widths of up
     to 50 inches.  The Company's rolling mills include automatic
     gauge control systems with hydraulic screwdowns allowing for
     microsecond adjustments during processing.  The Company
     operates a 56 inch reversing mill which the Company believes is
     the widest of its type in the industry.

     The Company's computerized mills produce products meeting the
     most stringent statistical quality control standards, enabling
     it to satisfy a growing industry demand for a range of steel
     from thicker to thinner, low carbons to alloy grades, all with
     precision gauge tolerances as close as +/- .0002 inches.

     The Company's rolling facilities are further complemented by 15
     high convection annealing furnaces, which shorten annealing times
     over conventional annealers.  The Company's newest furnaces
     incorporate the use of a hydrogen atmosphere for the production of
     cleaner and more uniform steel.  As a result of its annealing
     capabilities, the Company is able to produce cold-rolled strip
     steel with improved consistency in terms of hardness, molecular
     grain structure and surface.

                                      3
<PAGE>
     The Company can produce certain of its strip steel products on
     oscillated coils which wind the steel strip in a manner similar
     to the way thread is wound on a spool.  Oscillating the steel
     enables the Company to put at least six times greater volume of
     finished product on a coil than standard ribbon winding,
     allowing customers to achieve longer production runs by reducing
     the number of equipment shut-downs to change coils.  Customers
     are thus able to increase productivity, reduce downtime, improve
     yield and lengthen die life.

     Building and Construction Products
     The Company processes steel and other metal to manufacture a
     wide array of products for the building and construction
     industry.  Building and construction industry products are
     manufactured primarily from galvanized steel, as well as from
     aluminum, copper and other metals.  Building and construction
     products manufactured include metal trims, utility sheds,
     steel lumber connectors, metal roofing, drywall products,
     gutters and down spouts, ventilation products and storm panel
     systems for residential and commercial properties, registers,
     vents, bath cabinets, access doors, roof hatches and
     telescoping doors.

     The Company's existing building and construction products
     operations - comprised of Southeastern Metals Manufacturing
     Company, Inc. (SEMCO), with facilities located in Florida,
     Tennessee, Texas and Mississippi, The Solar Group (Solar),
     with three facilities located in Mississippi, Appleton Supply
     Co., Inc. (Appleton), with facilities located in Wisconsin
     and Missouri, United Steel Products Company (USP), with
     facilities located in Minnesota, California, North Carolina,
     New Jersey, Florida, Texas and Colorado, and K & W Metal
     Fabricators, Inc., d/b/a Weather Guard Building Products
     (Weather Guard), with operations based in Colorado - expanded
     during 2000 with the acquisition of Milcor, Inc. in July
     2000.  Milcor has operations located in Ohio and Michigan,
     which manufacture a complete line of metal building products,
     including registers, vents, bath cabinets, access doors, and
     telescoping doors.

     Precision Metal Products
     The Company's precision metal products are comprised primarily of
     higher value-added flat-rolled sheet steel, as well as steel
     strapping and other products.

                                     4
<PAGE>
     Precision Metal Processing.  The Company operates a precision metals
     facility in New York that primarily processes flat-rolled sheet
     steel.  In addition to slitting and cutting to length, this
     precision metals facility can produce higher value-added products
     which are held to close tolerances and tight specifications through
     cold-rolling, annealing, blanking, oscillating and edge rolling.

     The Company also operates precision metals facilities in
     Illinois and Alabama which process galvanized, Galvalume and
     prepainted steel and can slit and cut to length material
     based upon customer specifications.

     Steel Strapping.  Steel strapping is banding and packaging
     material that is used to close and reinforce shipping units such
     as bales, boxes, cartons, coils, crates and skids.  The Company
     manufactures high tensile strapping that is subject to strength
     requirements imposed by the American Society for Testing and
     Materials for packaging of different products for common carrier
     transport.  This high tensile steel strapping is essential to
     producers of large, heavy products such as steel, paper and lumber
     where reliability of the packaging material is critical to the
     safe transport of the product.

     The Company's QS9000 certified strapping facility manufactures
     high tensile steel strapping by slitting, oscillating, heat
     treating, painting and packaging cold-rolled coils.

     Steel strapping is cold-rolled to precise gauge on one of the
     Company's rolling mills, which incorporates hydraulic screwdowns
     and automatic gauge controls with statistical charting.  This
     process ensures strapping product of the most uniform gauge
     available and produces the maximum amount of strapping per pound
     of steel.  All products are tested by on-site laboratory personnel
     for width, thickness and other physical and metallurgical
     properties.

     To meet the differing needs of its customers, the Company offers
     its strapping products in various thicknesses, widths and coil
     sizes.  The Company also manufactures custom color and printed
     strapping.  In addition, the Company offers related strapping
     products, such as seals and tools, and is able to manufacture
     tensional strapping for lighter duty applications.

     Other Products.  The Company's Solar operation produces a
     complete line of mailboxes manufactured primarily with
     galvanized steel.

                                   5

     Heat Treating and Other Services
     Metallurgical Heat Treating Services.   The Company provides a
     wide range of metallurgical heat treating services  in which
     customer-owned parts are exposed to precise temperatures,
     atmospheres and quenchants and other conditions to improve their
     mechanical properties, durability and wear resistance.  These
     services include case-hardening, neutral-hardening and through-
     hardening processes for customers in a wide variety of industries.
     Using methods such as annealing, normalizing, vacuum hardening,
     carburizing, nitriding and brazing, as well as a host of other
     services, these heat treating processes can harden, soften or
     otherwise impart desired properties on parts made of steel,
     aluminum, copper and various alloys and other metals.

     The Company operates fifteen heat treating facilities in
     North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama,
     Michigan, Indiana and Illinois.  The Company maintains a
     metallurgical laboratory at each facility with trained
     metallurgists providing a range of testing capabilities to
     add value to treated parts and enhance quality control.
     Consistent quality control is maintained by application of a
     statistical process control system and QS/ISO 9002
     registration.  Additionally, the Company maintains a fleet of
     trucks and trailers to provide rapid turnaround time for its
     customers.

     Due to time and costs associated with transporting materials
     and customers' need for just-in-time delivery of heat treated
     products, the commercial heat treating industry has developed
     as a regional industry concentrated in major industrial areas
     of the country.  In addition, the commercial heat treating
     industry has realized significant growth in recent years as
     many companies involved in the manufacture of metal
     components outsource their heat treating requirements.  The
     Company believes that its heat treating facilities are
     strategically located to meet the needs of customers from a
     geographically diverse base of operations and to capitalize
     on the growing trend in outsourcing of heat treating
     operations.

     Materials Management Services.  The Company operates two materials
     management facilities that link primary steel producers and end-
     user manufacturers by integrating the inventory purchasing,
     receiving, inspection, billing, storage and shipping functions and
     producing true just-in-time delivery of materials.  These
     facilities receive shipments of steel by rail and truck from steel
     producers, which retain ownership of the steel until it is
     delivered to the end-user manufacturer.  The Company inspects the
     steel and stores it in a climate-controlled environment through
     the use of a specialized stacker crane and racking system.  When
     an order is placed, the Company often delivers the steel to the
     end-user manufacturer within one hour using Company-owned trucks
     that have been custom designed to facilitate the loading and
     unloading process.

                                     6
<PAGE>
     Steel Pickling Joint Venture.  The Company is a minority partner
     with a 31% interest in two steel pickling operations in Ohio.
     After the hot-rolling process, the surface of sheet steel is left
     with a residue known as scale, which must be removed prior to
     further processing by a cleaning process known as pickling.  This
     joint venture pickles steel on a toll basis, receiving fees for
     its pickling services without acquiring ownership of the steel.

     Quality Control

     The Company carefully selects its raw material vendors and uses
     computerized inspection and analysis to assure that the steel and
     other metals which it processes will be able to meet the most
     critical specifications of its customers.  The Company uses
     documented procedures during the production process, along with
     statistical process control computers linked directly to
     processing equipment, to monitor that such specifications are met.
     Physical, chemical and metallographic analyses are performed
     during the production process to verify that mechanical and
     dimensional properties, cleanliness, surface characteristics and
     chemical content are within specification.

     Suppliers and Raw Materials

     Steel and metal processing companies are required to maintain
     substantial inventories of raw materials in order to accommodate
     the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of
     their customers.  Accordingly, the Company generally maintains its
     inventory of raw materials at levels that it believes are
     sufficient to satisfy the anticipated needs of the customers based
     upon historic buying practices and market conditions.  The primary
     raw material processed by the Company is flat rolled steel
     purchased at regular intervals primarily from approximately 20
     major North American suppliers and a limited number of foreign
     steel companies.  The Company has no long-term commitments with
     any of its suppliers.

     Technical Services

     The Company employs a staff of engineers and other technical
     personnel and maintains fully-equipped, modern laboratories to
     support its operations.  These laboratories enable the Company to
     verify, analyze and document the
     physical, chemical, metallurgical and mechanical properties of its
     raw materials and products.  Technical service personnel also work
     in conjunction with the sales force to determine the types of steel
     required for the particular needs of the Company's customers.

                                     7
<PAGE>
     Sales and Marketing

     The Company's products and services are sold primarily by Company
     sales personnel and outside sales representatives located
     throughout the United States and Mexico.

     Customers and Distribution

     The Company has approximately 10,000 customers located throughout
     the United States, Canada and Mexico principally in the
     automotive, automotive supply, building and construction, steel,
     machinery and fastener industries.  Major customers include
     automobile manufacturers and suppliers, building and construction
     product distributors, and commercial and residential contractors.
     No customer of the Company represented 10% or more of the
     Company's net sales for 1998, 1999 or 2000.

     The Company manufactures its products exclusively to customer
     order rather than for inventory, except for building and
     construction products.  Although the Company negotiates annual
     sales orders with a majority of its customers, these orders are
     subject to customer confirmation as to product amounts and
     delivery dates.

     Competition

     The steel processing market is highly competitive.  The Company
     competes with a small number of other steel processors, some of
     which also focus on fully processed, high value-added steel
     products.  The Company competes on the basis of the precision and
     range of achievable tolerances, quality, price and the ability to
     meet delivery schedules dictated by customers.

     The Company also competes with a small number of other steel
     strapping manufacturers on the basis of quality, price, products,
     range of sizes offered and the ability to meet delivery schedules
     dictated by customers.

     The Company competes with numerous suppliers of building and
     construction products in its market based on the broad range of
     products offered, quality, price and delivery.

     The Company competes with a small number of suppliers of heat
     treating services in its market areas on the basis of processes
     offered, quality, price, and delivery.

     Employees

     At December 31, 2000, the Company employed approximately 3,500
     people, of which approximately 570 are represented by collective
     bargaining agreements.

     Backlog

     Because of the nature of the Company's products and the short lead
     time order cycle, backlog is not a significant factor in the
     Company's business.  The Company believes that substantially all
     of its firm orders existing on December 31, 2000 will be shipped
     prior to the end of 2001.

     Governmental Regulation

     The Company's processing centers and manufacturing facilities are
     subject to many federal, state and local requirements relating to
     the protection of the environment.  The Company believes that it
     is in material compliance with all environmental laws, does not
     anticipate any material expenditures in order to meet environmental
     requirements and does not believe that future compliance with such
     laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on its
     results of operations or financial condition.

     The Company's operations are also governed by many other laws and
     regulations.  The Company believes that it is in material
     compliance with these laws and regulations and does not believe
     that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a
     material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial
     condition.

     As of  December 31, 2000, there were 129 shareholders of record of

     Dealers Automated Quotation System - National Market System

     Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
             Condition and Results of Operations

     Results of Operations

     Year Ended 2000 Compared to Year Ended 1999

     Net sales increased $55.6 million, or 8.9%, to a record
     $677.5 million in 2000 from $621.9 million in 1999, despite
     the elimination of $19.4 million in sales from disposed of
     operations that were included in 1999 sales and a slowdown in
     the automotive and building products markets in the fourth
     quarter of 2000.  This increase primarily resulted from
     including the net sales of Milcor (acquired July 17, 2000)
     (the 2000 acquisition) from its acquisition date, and a full
     year of net sales of Southeastern Heat Treating (acquired
     April 1, 1999), Weather Guard (acquired July 1, 1999), Hi-
     Temp (acquired August 1, 1999), Brazing Concepts (acquired
     November 1, 1999) and Hughes (acquired December 1, 1999) (the
     1999 acquisitions), together with sales growth at existing
     operations.

     Cost of sales increased $47.8 million, or 9.7%, to $541.7
     million in 2000 from $493.9 million in 1999.  Cost of sales
     as a percentage of net sales increased to 80.0% in 2000 from
     79.4% in 1999 primarily due to  the impact of the slowdown in
     the automotive and construction products markets in the
     fourth quarter of 2000.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.4
     million, or 4.7%, to $75.9 million in 2000 from $72.5 million
     in 1999. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
     percentage of net sales decreased to 11.2% in 2000 from 11.7%
     in 1999 primarily due to the elimination of expenses from
     disposed of operations and decreases in performance based
     compensation, partially offset by higher costs attributable
     to the 1999 and 2000 acquisitions.

     Interest expense increased $5.5 million from 1999 to 2000 due
     to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisitions, current
     year capital expenditures and due to a higher effective
     interest rate in 2000 than in 1999.

     As a result of the above, income before taxes decreased $1.1
     million, or 2.6%, to $40.9 million in 2000 from $42.0 million
     in 1999.

     Income taxes approximated $16.6 million in 2000, based on a
     40.5% effective rate.


     Year Ended 1999 Compared to Year Ended 1998

     Net sales increased $64.0 million, or 11.5%, to $621.9
     million in 1999 from $557.9 million in 1998.  This increase
     primarily resulted from including the net sales of
     Southeastern Heat Treating (acquired April 1, 1999), Weather
     Guard (acquired July 1, 1999), Hi-Temp (acquired August 1,
     1999), Brazing Concepts (acquired November 1, 1999) and
     Hughes (acquired December 1, 1999) (the 1999 acquisitions)
     from their respective acquisition dates, and a full year of
     net sales of Solar (acquired March 1, 1998), Appleton
     (acquired April 1, 1998), USP (acquired June 1, 1998) and
     Harbor (acquired October 1, 1998) (the 1998 acquisitions),
     together with sales growth at existing operations.

     Cost of sales increased $37.5 million, or 8.2%, to $493.9
     million in 1999 from $456.4 million in 1998.  Cost of sales
     as a percentage of net sales decreased to 79.4% in 1999 from
     81.8% in 1998.  This improvement was due to the 1999 and 1998
     acquisitions, which have historically generated higher
     margins than the Company's existing operations, and due to
     lower raw material costs at existing operations.

                                    14
<PAGE>
     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $15.5
     million, or 27.1%, to $72.5 million in 1999 from $57.0 in
     1998.  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
     percentage of net sales increased to 11.7% in 1999 from 10.2%
     in 1998.  This increase was due to higher costs as a
     percentage of net sales attributable to the 1999 and 1998
     acquisitions, and due to performance based compensation
     linked to the Company's sales and profitability.

     Interest expense increased by $2.0 million from 1998 to 1999
     primarily due to higher borrowings in 1999 as a result of the
     Company's current year acquisitions and capital expenditures
     and due to a higher effective interest rate in 1999 than in
     1998.

     As a result of the above, income before taxes increased $9.0
     million, or 27.1%, to $42.0 million in 1999 from $33.1
     million in 1998.

     Income taxes approximated $17.0 million in 1999, based on a
     40.5% effective rate compared with a 40.0% effective rate in
     1998.


     Liquidity and Capital Resources

     During 2000, the Company's working capital increased by $19.5
     million to $132.4 million at December 31, 2000 from $112.9
     million at December 31, 1999 primarily from the inclusion of
     inventories of the 2000 acquisition, and a decrease in
     accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from
     decreased purchases during the fourth quarter of 2000 in
     response to the slowdown in the automotive and construction
     products markets.  Long-term debt decreased to 55% of total
     capitalization, despite increasing by $20.2 million to $255.5
     million, at December 31, 2000.  Additionally, shareholders'
     equity increased by 12.3% to $208.3 million.

     The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund its
     operations, including working capital requirements, the
     purchase and funding of improvements to its property and
     equipment, and to fund acquisitions.

     The Company's primary sources of liquidity are from cash
     provided by operating activities and the Company's revolving
     credit facility.  Net cash provided by operations of $34.1
     million resulted primarily from net income of $24.4 million,
     depreciation and amortization of $21.2 million, the provision
     for deferred income taxes of $5.3 million and a decrease in
     accounts receivable of $5.7 million, offset by decreases in
     accounts payable and accrued expenses of $16.6 million and
     increases in other current assets of $2.8 million and other
     assets of $2.6 million.

     During 2000, the Company amended its revolving credit
     agreement with its bank group to increase the capacity of its
     revolver to $310 million.  Borrowings thereunder are secured
     with its accounts receivable, inventories and property and
     equipment.  At December 31, 2000, the Company had interest
     rate swap agreements outstanding which effectively converted
     $50 million of borrowings under the revolving credit
     agreement to fixed rates ranging from 7.47% to 8.18%.  The
     Company accounts for interest rate swap agreements on an
     accrual basis.  Additional borrowings under the revolving
     credit facility carry interest at LIBOR plus a fixed rate.
     The weighted average interest rate of these borrowings was
     8.70% at December 31, 2000.

     Net cash provided by operations of $34.1 million, $7.8
     million net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment
     and the net proceeds from long-term debt of $19.2 million
     were primarily used for the acquisition of Milcor, capital
     expenditures and payment of cash dividends.

     The Company believes that availability under its credit
     facility, together with funds generated from operations, will
     be more than sufficient to provide the Company with the
     liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund its
     anticipated working capital requirements, acquisitions and
     capital expenditure commitments for the next twelve months.

     The Company believes that environmental issues will not
     require the expenditure of material amounts for environmental
     compliance in the future.


     Recent Accounting Pronouncement

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
     issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
     Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
     (FAS No. 133) which requires recognition of the fair value
     of derivatives in the statement of financial position, with
     changes in the fair value recognized either in earnings or
     as a component of other comprehensive income dependent upon
     the hedging nature of the derivative.  Implementation of FAS
     No. 133 is required for fiscal 2001.  FAS No. 133 will not
     have a material impact on the Company's earnings or other
     comprehensive income.


                          Safe Harbor Statement

     The Company wishes to take advantage of the Safe Harbor
     provisions included in the Private Securities Litigation
     Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act").  Statements by the Company,
     other than historical information, constitute "forward
     looking statements" within the meaning of the Act and may be
     subject to a number of risk factors.  Factors that could
     affect these statements include, but are not limited to, the
     following:  the impact of changing steel prices on the
     Company's results of operations; changing demand for the
     company's products and services; the impact of the Year 2000
     matter; and changes in interest or tax rates.

             Company Responsibility For Financial Statements


     The accompanying consolidated financial statements of
     Gibraltar Steel Corporation have been prepared by management,
     which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
     The statements have been prepared in conformity with
     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
     and include amounts based on management's best estimates and
     judgments.  Financial information elsewhere in this Annual
     Report is consistent with that in the consolidated financial
     statements.

     The Company has established and maintains a system of
     internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance
     that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records
     reflect the authorized transactions of the Company.

     The financial statements have been audited by
     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants.  As part
     of their audit of the Company's 2000 financial statements,
     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP considered the Company's system of
     internal control to the extent they deemed necessary to
     determine the nature, timing and extent of their audit tests.

     The Board of Directors pursues its responsibility for the
     Company's financial reporting through its Audit Committee,
     which is composed entirely of outside directors.  The
     independent accountants have direct access to the Audit
     Committee, with and without the presence of management
     representatives, to discuss the results of their audit work
     and their comments on the adequacy of internal accounting
     controls and the quality of financial reporting.

                    Report of Independent Accountants



     To the Board of Directors and
     Shareholders of Gibraltar Steel Corporation


     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
     listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all
     material respects, the financial position of Gibraltar
     Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31,
     2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and
     their cash flows for each of the three years in the
     period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with
     accounting principles generally accepted in the United
     States.  These financial statements are the
     responsibility of the Company's management; our
     responsibility is to express an opinion on these
     financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted
     our audits of these statements in accordance with
     auditing standards generally accepted in the United
     States, which require that we plan and perform the audit
     to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
     financial statements are free of material misstatement.
     An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
     supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
     statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
     significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
     the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
     that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
     opinion expressed above.

                       GIBRALTAR STEEL CORPORATION

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


       1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       Principles of Consolidation

       The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
       Gibraltar Steel Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company).
       Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
       eliminated.

       Use of Estimates

       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
       generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
       make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
       in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual
       results could differ from those estimates.

       Cash and Cash Equivalents

       Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, checking
       accounts and all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
       three months or less.

       Inventories

       Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is
       determined using the first-in, first-out method.

       Property, Plant and Equipment

       Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and
       depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
       straight-line method.  Accelerated methods are used for income
       tax purposes.  Interest is capitalized in connection with
       construction of qualified assets.  Under this policy, interest
       of $552,000, $357,000 and $404,000 was capitalized in 2000,
       1999 and 1998, respectively.

       Goodwill

       Goodwill is amortized over 35 years.  Amortization expense
       related to goodwill was $3,710,000, $2,647,000 and $1,949,000
       in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.  Accumulated
       amortization was $9,961,000 and $6,251,000 at December 31, 2000
       and 1999.

       Shareholders' Equity

       In 1999 and 1998, the Company issued 20,572 and 11,000,
       respectively, of its common shares as contributions to its
       profit sharing plans.  The Company did not contribute any of
       its shares to its profit sharing plans during 2000.

       During 2000 and 1999, the Company declared dividends of
       $1,447,000 and $1,568,000, respectively, of which $377,000 and
       $315,000 are accrued at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
       respectively.

       During 2000, the Company purchased 12,572 shares of its
       outstanding common stock at a cost of $14.38 per share.  The
       Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in
       prior years.

       Interest Rate Exchange Agreements

       Interest rate swap agreements, which are used by the Company in
       the management of interest rate risk, are accounted for on an
       accrual basis.  Amounts to be paid or received under interest rate
       swap agreements are recognized as interest expense or income in
       the periods in which they accrue.  Swaps are not used for trading
       purposes.

       Income Taxes

       The financial statements of the Company have been prepared
       using the asset and liability approach in accounting for income
       taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
       liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
       temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax
       bases of other assets and liabilities.

       Earnings Per Share

       Basic net income per share equals net income divided by the
       weighted average shares outstanding during the year.  The
       computation of diluted net income per share includes all
       dilutive common stock equivalents in the weighted average
       shares outstanding.

      2.  ACQUISITIONS

       On July 17, 2000, the Company purchased all the outstanding
       capital stock of Milcor Limited Partnership (Milcor) for
       approximately $43 million in cash.  Milcor manufactures a
       complete line of metal building products, including
       registers, vents, bath cabinets, access doors, roof hatches
       and telescoping doors.

       On December 1, 1999, the Company purchased all the outstanding
       capital stock of Hughes Manufacturing, Inc. (Hughes) for
       approximately $11.5 million in cash.  Hughes manufactures a
       broad line of fully engineered, code-approved steel lumber
       connectors and other metal hardware products.

       On November 1, 1999, the Company purchased all the outstanding
       capital stock of Brazing Concepts Company (Brazing Concepts)
       for approximately $25 million in cash.  Brazing Concepts
       provides a wide variety of value-added brazing (i.e., metal
       joining), assembly and other metallurgical heat treating
       services on customer-owned materials.

       On August 1, 1999, the Company purchased the assets and
       business of Hi-Temp Incorporated (Hi-Temp) for approximately
       $24 million in cash.  Hi-Temp provides metallurgical heat
       treating services in which customer-owned parts are exposed to
       precise temperature and other conditions to improve their
       material properties, strength and durability.

       On July 1, 1999, the Company purchased all the outstanding
       capital stock of K & W Metal Fabricators, Inc. d/b/a Weather
       Guard Building Products (Weather Guard) for approximately $7
       million in cash.  Weather Guard manufactures a full line of

       roofing and roofing accessories, for industrial, commercial and
       residential applications.

      These acquisitions have been accounted for under the
      purchase method with the results of their operations
      consolidated with the Company's results of operations from
      the respective acquisition dates. The aggregate excess of
      the purchase prices of these acquisitions over the fair
      market values of the net assets of the acquired companies
      is being amortized over 35 years from the acquisition dates
      using the straight-line method.

      The following information presents the pro forma
      consolidated condensed results of operations as if the
      acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 1999.  The pro
      forma amounts may not be indicative of the results that
      actually would have been achieved had the acquisitions
      occurred as of January 1, 1999 and are not necessarily
      indicative of future results of the combined companies.

       In 2000, the Company amended its debt agreement increasing its
       revolving credit facility to $310,000,000.  The facility is
       secured by the Company's accounts receivable, inventories, and
       property and equipment and is committed through April 2003.
       This facility has various interest rate options which are no
       greater than the bank's prime rate.  In addition, the Company
       may enter into interest rate exchange agreements (swaps) to
       manage interest costs and exposure to changing interest rates.
       At December 31, 2000 the Company had  interest rate swap
       agreements outstanding which effectively converted $50,000,000
       of floating rate debt to fixed rates ranging from 7.47% to
       8.18%.  At December 31, 2000, additional credit facility
       borrowings consisted of $200,251,000 with an interest rate of
       LIBOR plus a fixed rate.  The weighted average interest rate of
       these borrowings was 8.70% at December 31, 2000.

       In addition, the Company has Industrial Development Revenue
       Bonds payable in installments through September 2018, with
       interest rates ranging from a fixed rate of 4.22% to variable
       rates of up to 5.20% at December 31, 2000, which financed the
       cost of the expansion of its Coldwater, Michigan heat treating
       facility, under a capital lease agreement.  The cost of the
       facility and equipment equals the amount of the bonds and
       includes accumulated amortization of $186,000.  The agreement
       provide for the purchase of the facility and equipment at any
       time during the lease term at scheduled amounts or at the end
       of the lease for a nominal amount.

       The aggregate maturities on long-term debt including lease
       purchase obligations for the five years following December 31,
       2000 as follows: 2001, $327,000; 2002, $813,000; 2003,
       $250,875,000; 2004, $629,000: and 2005, $480,000.   The Company
       had no amounts outstanding under short-term borrowing for the
       years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999.

       The various loan agreements, which do not require compensating
       balances, contain provisions that limit additional borrowings
       and require maintenance of minimum net worth and financial
       ratios. The Company is in compliance with the terms and
       provisions of all its financing agreements.

       Total cash paid for interest in the years ended December 31,
       2000, 1999 and 1998 was $19,935,000, $13,357,000 and
       $11,257,000, respectively.

       8.  LEASES

       The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
       operating leases.  Rent expense under operating leases for the
       years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $5,187,000,
       $4,899,000 and $3,554,000, respectively.  Future minimum lease
       payments under these operating leases are $5,067,000,
       $3,980,000, $2,969,000, $1,867,000 and $1,244,000 for the years
       2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, and $7,470,000
       thereafter through 2038.

       9.  EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS

       Certain subsidiaries participate in the Company's 40l(k) Plan.
       In addition, certain subsidiaries have multi-employer non-
       contributory retirement plans providing for defined
       contributions to union retirement funds.

       A supplemental pension plan provides defined pension benefits
       to certain salaried employees upon retirement.  Net unfunded
       periodic pension costs of $171,000 and $199,000 were accrued
       under this plan in 2000 and 1999, respectively, and consisted
       primarily of service cost using a discount rate of 8.0% in each
       year.

                                      28
<PAGE>

       Total expense for all retirement plans was $2,204,000,
       $1,957,000 and $1,774,000 for the years ended December 31,
       2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

       During 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of  Statement
       of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 Employers'
       Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits
       (FAS No. 132).  Adoption of FAS No. 132 did not affect the
       Company's results of operations or financial position.

       10.  OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS

       Certain subsidiaries of the Company provide health and life
       insurance to substantially all of their employees and to a
       number of retirees and their spouses.  The net periodic post-
       retirement benefit cost charged to expense consisting of
       service cost, interest cost and amortization of transition
       obligations was $261,000, $291,000 and $255,000 for the years
       ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

       The approximate unfunded accumulated post-retirement benefit
       obligation at December 31, consists of the following (in
       thousands):

      Benefit                                             Benefit
    Obligation  Service Interest  Actuarial  Benefit    Obligation

       The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was
       determined using a weighted average discount rate of 8.0% in
       2000 and 1999.  The medical inflation rate was assumed to be
       5.0% in 2000 and thereafter.  The effect of a 1% increase or
       decrease in the annual medical inflation rate would increase or
       decrease the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation at
       December 31, 2000 by approximately $312,000 and $266,000,
       respectively, and increase or decrease the annual service and
       interest costs by approximately $38,000.

       One of the Company's subsidiaries also provides post-retirement
       health care benefits to its unionized employees through
       contributions to a multi-employer health care plan.

       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 Earnings
       Per Share requires dual presentation of basic and diluted
       earnings per share on the face of the income statement.  The
       reconciliation between the computations is as follows:

       13.  STOCK OPTIONS

       The Company may grant non-qualified stock options to officers,
       employees, non-employee directors and advisers at an exercise
       price equal to 100% of market price, and incentive stock
       options to officers and other key employees at an exercise
       price not less than 100% of market price, up to an aggregate of
       400,000 and 1,475,000 shares, respectively.  The options may be
       exercised over a four year period from the grant date and
       expire ten years after the date of grant.

       The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123  Accounting
       for Stock-Based Compensation (FAS No. 123).  Accordingly, no
       compensation cost has been recognized for the option plans as
       stock options granted under these plans have an exercise price
       equal to 100% of the market price on the date of grant.  If the
       compensation cost for these plans had been determined based on
       the fair value at the grant dates for awards consistent with
       the method of FAS No. 123, the unaudited pro forma effect on
       the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 is as follows:

                As Reported    Pro forma  As Reported    Pro forma

Net Income per
 Share-Basic          $1.94        $1.83        $1.99        $1.88

       The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used to estimate the
       fair value of the options granted on the date of grant.  The
       fair values and assumptions used in the model, assuming no
       dividends, are as follows:

                       Expected   Stock       Risk-Free    Dividend
            Fair Value   Life   Volatility  Interest Rate   Yield

1998 Grant     $7.74   5 years    43.7%         4.4%          -

       The Company also has a Restricted Stock Plan reserved for
       issuance of 100,000 common shares for the grant of restricted
       stock awards to employees and non-employee directors at a
       purchase price of $.01 per share.  Since the inception of this
       plan, 59,000 common shares have been awarded.

       14.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

       The Company is a party to certain claims and legal actions
       generally incidental to its business.  Management does not
       believe that the outcome of these actions, which is not clearly
       determinable at the present time, would significantly affect
       the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

       15.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

       In February 2001, the Company purchased all the outstanding
       capital stock of Pennsylvania Industrial Heat Treaters, Inc.
       (PIHT) for approximately $11 million, net of cash.  PIHT
       provides metallurgical heat treating services and specializes
       in heat treating powdered metal parts.  The results of
       operations of PIHT will be consolidated with the Company's
       results of operations from the acquisition date for the quarter
       ending  March 31, 2001.

Secretary of the Treasury, be established as the maximum amount that

his spouse shall be obtained in writing within the 90 day period ending
on the annuity  starting  date.   The annuity starting date is the
first day  of the first period for  which an amount is paid as an
annuity or any   other  form. The  Committee shall  notify  the
Participant  and his  spouse of the right to defer any distribution
until the Participant's Accrued Benefit is no longer immediately
distributable. Such  notification shall include a general description
of the material features, and an explanation of the relative  values
of, the optional forms of benefit available  under the Plan and shall
be provided no less than 30 days and no more than 90 days prior to the
annuity starting date. If a distribution is one to which Sections
401(a)(11) and  417 of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply, such
distribution may commence less than 30  days  after the notice required
under section 1.411(a)-11(c) of the Income Tax Regulations  is  given,
provided that:
                            46
<PAGE>
(a) the  Committee clearly informs the Participant that the Participant
has a right to a period of at least 30 days after receiving the notice
to consider the decision of whether  or  not  to  elect a
distribution(and, if applicable, a particular distribution option), and
(b) the Participant, after receiving the notice, affirmatively elects a
distribution.  If the Participant and the Participant's spouse do not
consent to  such distribution, the Committee shall direct the Trustee
to segregate the value of his vested interest in his Accrued Benefit as
determined above, in an individual interest-bearing account and to hold
the same or distribution upon the  earlier of his attainment of age 65,
death, disability or, if applicable, the satisfaction of the age
requirement for early retirement provided the service or participation
requirement, if  any, was satisfied prior to his termination of
employment. When such former Participant is entitled to distribution as
provided in the preceding  sentence, the  Committee shall direct the
Trustee to distribute   the  value of such segregated account to such
former Participant or his Beneficiary in accordance with Section 6.07.
If a terminated Participant is rehired by the Employer and he again
becomes a Participant, any amount so segregated and not distributed
shall be reinvested with the remainder of the Trust Fund and  be
credited with earnings, losses  and expenses of the Trust. In the case
of any terminated Participant  who has incurred five (5)consecutive One
Year Periods Of Severance prior to his reparticipation in the Plan, the
Committee shall establish  and maintain  for such Participant a
separate Account for such reinvested amount.
At the time  a former Participant is entitled to distribution,
according to  its records, the Committee shall send, by registered or
certified mail directed to his address last known to the Committee, a
notice informing him as to his rights with respect to any amounts held
for him and requesting confirmation of his address and age. Each
Participant and former  Participant has the obligation to keep the
Committee informed of his address. In the event the Committee is unable
to locate such former Participant within four(4) years, the amount held
for his benefit shall be forfeited; provided, however, if a claim is
made by the Participant or his Beneficiary for the forfeited

                                  47
<PAGE>
amount, such amount shall be reinstated into his Account.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall direct the Trustee
to make a lump sum payment of a Participant's vested interest in his
Accrued Benefit and his Account attributable to his own contributions
if his vested interest in his Accrued Benefit plus his Account
attributable to his own contributions is less than $5,000.00." 16.
Section 6.07(c) is hereby amended by the addition thereto of the
following paragraph immediately following the first paragraph of
that section:

"A Participant may elect, with applicable spousal
consent, to waive the requirement that the written explanation be
provided at least 30 days before the annuity starting date, provided
that the distribution commences more than 7 days after such explanation
is provided. In addition, the written explanation may be provided after
the annuity starting date, provided that the applicable election period
shall not end before the 30th day after the date on which such
explanation is provided, except that the Participant can waive such 30
day requirement provided that the distribution commences more than 7
days after the explanation is provided."

17.  The first paragraph of Section 6.10(b) is hereby amended by the
addition thereto of the following:

                                  48
<PAGE>

"Notwithstanding the above, effective January 1, 1997, the required
beginning date of a Participant is the first day of April of the
calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the
Participant attains age 70 1/2 or, in the case of a non-5 percent owner,
the calendar year in which the Participant retires; provided, however,
that the provisions of this sentence shall only apply to employees who
attain age 70 1/2 after December 31, 2000."


                      49

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Employer has caused this instrument to be
executed in its name and attested by its corporate officers hereunto
duly authorized as of this 22 day of March, 2000.

Dear _____________:

     As you are aware, Gibraltar Steel Corporation (the
"Company") is examining various strategic alternatives in an
effort to enhance shareholder value.  In this regard, one
alternative being examined is a sale of the Company in its
entirety.  You are important to the success of the business
of the Company and your active involvement during a sale of
the business and a transition period subsequent to such sale
is essential. Accordingly, it is in the best interests of
the Company to have an understanding with you regarding your
continued employment.

     Based on the above, the Company will provide, and will
require the party that acquires the Company to provide, you
with the following rights and benefits:

     1.   Your salary and benefits, both contributory and
non-contributory, will be maintained at levels which are not
less than the levels which are in effect as of September 1,
2000, for a period of six (6) months following the date on
which a "Sale" (as hereinafter defined) occurs (such date
being hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date"). For
purposes of this letter, a "Sale" will be deemed to occur
upon: (a) the sale (including a transfer occurring as a
result of a tender offer, an exchange offer or the
consummation of a plan of merger or consolidation) of ninety
percent (90%) or more of the Company's issued and
outstanding stock or (b) the sale of all or substantially
all of the Company's assets with the buyer assuming all or
substantially all of its liabilities, to any person or group
(within the meaning of Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

                            51
<PAGE>
     2.   If a Sale occurs before the end of the calendar
year 2001, or if, at the end of such calendar year,
negotiations regarding a possible Sale to an identified
prospective purchaser with sufficient financial resources
are taking place and such negotiations result in a Sale
which occurs by March 31, 2002, the Company will pay to you
bonus payments as described herein upon and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this letter.

     3.   If a Sale which satisfies the conditions of
paragraph 2 above occurs, you will, subject to your
compliance with the terms of this letter, be entitled
to receive an amount based upon the per share Sales Price as
set forth in Schedule I annexed hereto (such amount being
hereinafter referred to as the "Stay Bonus").

     4.   In order to receive any payment as described
herein, you must remain in the Company's active employment
(or, if applicable, in the active employment of the
purchaser or any of its affiliates ("Purchaser")) through
the date that a payment becomes payable as described below.

     5.   If a Sale which satisfies the conditions of
paragraph 2 above occurs, and you have satisfied the
requirements of paragraph 4, one-half of the amount of the
Stay Bonus will become payable and will be paid to you in
one lump sum on the Closing Date and the remaining one-half
of the Stay Bonus will become payable and will be paid to
you in one lump sum at the end of the six (6) month period
following the Closing Date.

     6.  If, for any reason, your employment with the
Company or the Purchaser is terminated before any payment as
described in paragraph 5 becomes payable to you, you will
not be entitled to such payment or payments. In addition, if
a Sale does not occur in a manner which satisfies the
conditions set forth in Paragraph 2 above, the Stay Bonus
will not be payable.

       7. The fact that the Company has agreed, by the
terms of this letter, to make payments to you as provided
for in this letter, is strictly confidential. As a result,
you are expressly prohibited from disclosing or revealing to
any person or entity, any information regarding the specific
terms of this letter or the existence of the Company's
agreement, as contained in this letter, to make payments to
you which are conditioned, in part, on the occurrence of a
Sale and your continued active employment with the Company
or a Purchaser.  If it is determined that you have violated
the provisions of this paragraph 7, you will not be entitled
to receive any payment of the amounts described above in
this letter.
                                52
<PAGE>
     8.  As you know, on July 9, 1998, the Company entered
into an agreement (hereinafter the "Change in Control
Agreement") providing for the payment to you of certain
amounts in the event that your employment with the Company
is terminated under certain specified conditions following a
change in control of the Company (as defined in such Change
in Control Agreement).  It is the Company's intent that you
will not be entitled to receive both the second half of the
Stay Bonus as provided for by this letter and the full
amount of the payments provided for by the Change in Control
Agreement.  Accordingly, by your execution of this letter as
provided for at the end hereof, you will be deemed to
expressly agree that the Change in Control Agreement will be
deemed and construed to be amended, by this letter (and this
letter will be deemed to constitute an amendment to the
Change in Control Agreement), to provide that, if and to the
extent that you are paid the second half of the Stay Bonus
provided for by this letter, the amount of any payments you
may thereafter become entitled to receive under the terms
of the Change in Control Agreement will be reduced by an
amount equal to the second half of the Stay Bonus provided
for by this letter.

     9.  Your right to receive the Stay Bonus will only
apply to one Sale. Therefore, you will not have any right to
receive payment of a second Stay Bonus if, after the closing
of the Sale, a sale of all or substantially all the assets
of the Company or a sale of any portion of the issued and
outstanding stock of the Company occurs.

                            53

     Thank you for your cooperation and support in exploring
and implementing the strategic alternatives facing our
Company. We believe your continued best efforts will help
ensure a successful endeavor.

                              Yours truly,

                         GIBRALTAR STEEL CORPORATION



                         By:/s/ Brian J. Lipke
                            Brian J. Lipke,
                            Chairman of the Board and Chief
                            Executive Officer



Agreed to and Acknowledged
this ___ day of October, 2000.
