     Item 1. Description of Business
     
     General
     
     The Company is a processor of a broad array of high value-
     added,  technically sophisticated steel and other metal
     products.  The Company utilizes any one or a combination
     of several different processes at each of its operating
     facilities to add substantial margin and value to raw
     material acquired from primary steel and other metal
     producers.  Underlying each of these processes is a common
     set of steel and metal processing core competencies.
     These core competencies are the foundation upon which all
     the Company's operations and customer offerings are based.
     Expertise in these core competencies has allowed the
     Company to successfully expand beyond its original cold-
     rolled strip steel and steel strapping processing
     operations to the processing of building and construction
     products and providing of metallurgical heat treating and
     materials management services.
     
     Industry Overview
     
     Steel and metal processors occupy a market niche that
     exists between the primary steel and metal producers and
     end-users and others.  Primary steel and metal producers
     typically focus on the sale of standard size and tolerance
     steel and other metals to large volume purchasers,
     including steel and metal processors.  At the same time,
     end-users require steel with closer tolerances and with
     shorter lead times than the primary steel and metal
     producers can provide efficiently.
     
     Metal Processes, Products and Services
     
     The Company produces and delivers a variety of products
     and services on a just-in-time basis for  industrial
     manufacturers, fabricators and other end-users in the
     automotive, automotive supply, appliance, building and
     construction, machinery, and steel industries.

                                  2

     Other processes and services         13%         9%       7%
     
     The following steel and metal products, processes, and
     services are provided by the Company:
     
     Cold-Rolled Strip Steel
     The Company produces a broad range of fully processed cold-
     rolled strip steel products.  The Company buys wide, open
     tolerance sheet steel in coils from primary steel producers
     and processes it to specific customer orders by performing
     such computer-aided processes as cold reduction, annealing,
     temper rolling, edge rolling and slitting.  Cold reduction
     is the rolling of steel to a specified thickness, tolerance
     and finish.  Annealing is a thermal process which changes
     hardness and certain metallurgical characteristics of steel.
     Temper rolling is the rolling of steel to a specific
     hardness.  Edge rolling involves conditioning edges of
     processed steel into square, fully round or partially round
     shapes.  Slitting is the cutting of steel to specified
     widths.  Depending on customer specifications, one or more
     of these processes are utilized to produce steel strip of a
     precise grade, temper, tolerance and finish.
     
     The Company operates 10 rolling mills at its facilities in
     Cleveland, Ohio, Chattanooga, Tennessee and Buffalo, New
     York, all of which are QS9000 certified, and is capable of
     rolling widths of up to 50 inches.  The Company has the
     capability to process coils up to a maximum of 72 inch
     outside diameter.  The Company's rolling mills include
     automatic gauge control systems with hydraulic screwdowns
     allowing for microsecond adjustments during processing.  In
     January 1998, the Company began operating a 56 inch
     reversing mill which the Company believes is the widest of
     its type in the industry.
     
     The Company's computerized mills produce products meeting
     the most stringent statistical quality control standards,
     enabling it to satisfy a growing industry demand for a range
     of steel from thicker to thinner, low carbons to alloy
     grades, all with precision gauge tolerances as close as +/-
     .0002 inches.

                                  3
<PAGE>
     The Company's rolling facilities are further complemented by 15
     high convection annealing furnaces, which shorten annealing
     times over conventional annealers.  The Company's newest
     furnaces incorporate the use of a hydrogen atmosphere for the
     production of cleaner and more uniform steel.  As a result of
     its annealing capabilities, the Company is able to produce cold-
     rolled strip steel with improved consistency in terms of
     thickness, hardness, molecular grain structure and surface.
     
     The Company can produce certain of its strip steel products
     on oscillated coils which wind the steel strip in a manner
     similar to the way thread is wound on a spool.  Oscillating
     the steel enables the Company to put at least six times
     greater volume of finished product on a coil than standard
     ribbon winding, allowing customers to achieve longer
     production runs by reducing the number of equipment shut-
     downs to change coils.  Customers are thus able to increase
     productivity, reduce downtime, improve yield and lengthen die
     life.
     
     Building and Construction Products
     The Company processes steel and other metal to manufacture
     a wide array of  products for the building and
     construction industry.  Building and construction industry
     products are manufactured primarily from galvanized steel,
     as well as from aluminum, copper and other metals.
     Building and construction products manufactured include
     metal trims, prefab homes and utility sheds, steel lumber
     connectors, metal roofing, drywall products, gutters and
     down spouts, ventilation products and storm panel systems
     for residential and commercial properties.
     
     During 1998, the Company acquired three building and
     construction products companies which broaden its product
     line, extends its geographic reach and further diversifies
     and builds its customer base.  The Solar Group (Solar),
     acquired in March 1998, operates three facilities located
     in Mississippi and primarily manufactures wind turbines,
     power vents, other ventilation products and accessories.
     Appleton Supply Co., Inc. (Appleton), acquired in April
     1998 with facilities located in Wisconsin and Missouri,
     also manufacturers ventilation products and accessories,
     as well as roofing products and other construction
     products.  United Steel Products Company (USP), acquired
     in June 1998 with facilities located in Minnesota,
     California, North Carolina and New Jersey,  is a leading
     producer of steel lumber connectors and gives the Company
     its first manufacturing and distribution facility on the
     West Coast.  These three acquisitions compliment the
     Company's existing building and construction products
     business comprised of Southeastern Metals Manufacturing
     Company, Inc. (SEMCO), with facilities located in Florida,
     Georgia, Tennessee and Texas.   All of these facilities
     use precision engineering combined with slitting,
     stamping, roll forming and other processes to manufacture
     their various products.

                                  4     
<PAGE>     
     Precision Metal Products
     The Company's precision metal products are comprised primarily of
     higher value-added flat-rolled sheet steel, as well as steel
     strapping and other products.
     
     Precision Metal Processing.  The Company operates two precision
     metals facilities in New York and Tennessee which primarily
     process flat-rolled sheet steel.  In addition to slitting and
     cutting to length, these precision metals facilities can produce
     higher value-added products which are held to close tolerances
     and tight specifications through cold-rolling, annealing,
     blanking, oscillating and edging rolling.
     
     The Company also operates two precision metals facilities
     in Illinois and Alabama which process galvanized,
     Galvalume and prepainted steel and can slit and cut to
     length material based upon customer specifications.
     
     Steel Strapping.  Steel strapping is banding and packaging
     material that is used to close and reinforce shipping units
     such as bales, boxes, cartons, coils, crates and skids.  The
     Company believes that it is one of four major domestic
     manufacturers of high tensile steel strapping, which is used in
     heavy duty applications.  High tensile strapping is subject to
     strength requirements imposed by the American Society for
     Testing and Materials for packaging of different products for
     common carrier transport.  This high tensile steel strapping is
     essential to producers of large, heavy products such as steel,
     paper and lumber where reliability of the packaging material is
     critical to the safe transport of the product.
     
     The Company's QS9000 certified strapping facility manufactures
     high tensile steel strapping by slitting, oscillating, heat
     treating, painting and packaging cold-rolled coils.
     
     Steel strapping is cold-rolled to precise gauge on one of the
     Company's rolling mills, which incorporates hydraulic screw
     downs and automatic gauge controls with statistical charting.
     This process ensures strapping product of the most uniform
     gauge available and produces the maximum amount of strapping
     per pound of steel.  All products are tested by on-site
     laboratory personnel for width, thickness and other physical
     and metallurgical properties.
     
     To meet the differing needs of its customers, the Company
     offers its strapping products in various thicknesses, widths
     and coil sizes.  The Company also manufactures custom color and
     printed strapping.  In addition, the Company offers related
     strapping products, such as seals and tools, and is able to
     manufacture tensional strapping for lighter duty applications.

                                  5
<PAGE>     
     Other Products.  The Company's Solar acquisition produces
     a complete line of mailboxes manufactured primarily with
     galvanized steel.  The Company believes it is the largest
     manufacturer of mailboxes in the United States.
     
     Other Processes and Services
     Metallurgical Heat Treating Services.   The Company provides a
     wide range of metallurgical heat treating services  in which
     customer-owned parts are exposed to precise temperature and
     other conditions to improve their mechanical properties,
     durability and wear resistance.  These services include case-
     hardening, surface-hardening and through-hardening processes
     for customers in a wide variety of industries.  Using methods
     such as annealing,
     flame hardening, vacuum hardening, carburizing and nitriding,
     as well as a host of other services, these heat treating
     processes can harden, soften or otherwise impart desired
     properties on parts made of steel, copper and various alloys
     and other metals.  A variety of brazing services to join
     metallic objects together is also provided.
     
     The Company acquired Harbor Metal Treating Co., Inc.
     (Harbor) in October 1998 and now operates nine heat
     treating facilities in North Carolina, South Carolina,
     Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Michigan, Indiana and
     Illinois.  The Company maintains a metallurgical
     laboratory at each facility providing a range of testing
     capabilities to add value to treated parts and enhance
     quality control.  Consistent quality control is maintained
     by application of a statistical process control system.
     Additionally, the Company maintains a fleet of trucks and
     trailers to provide rapid turnaround time for its
     customers.
     
     Due to time and costs associated with transporting
     materials and customers' need for just-in-time delivery of
     heat treated products, the commercial heat treating
     industry has developed as a regional industry concentrated
     in major industrial areas of the country.  In addition,
     the commercial heat treating industry has realized
     significant growth in recent years as many companies
     involved in the manufacture of metal components outsource
     their heat treating requirements.  The Company believes
     that its heat treating facilities are strategically
     located to meet the needs of customers from a
     geographically diverse base of operations and to
     capitalize on the growing trend in outsourcing of heat
     treating operations.
     
     Materials Management Services.  The Company operates two
     materials management facilities that link primary steel
     producers and end-user manufacturers by integrating the
     inventory purchasing, receiving, inspection, billing, storage
     and shipping functions and producing true just-in-time delivery
     of materials.  These facilities receive shipments of steel by
     rail and truck from steel producers, which retain ownership of
     the steel until it is delivered to the end-user manufacturer.
     The Company inspects the steel and stores it in a climate-
     controlled environment through the use of a specialized stacker
     crane and racking system.  When an order is placed, the Company

                                  6
<PAGE>     
     often delivers the steel to the end-user manufacturer within
     one hour using Company-owned trucks that have been custom
     designed to facilitate the loading and unloading process.
     
     Steel Pickling Joint Venture.  The Company is a minority
     partner in two steel pickling operations in Ohio.  After the
     hot-rolling process, the surface of sheet steel is left with a
     residue known as scale, which must be removed prior to further
     processing by a cleaning process known as pickling.  This joint
     venture pickles steel on a toll basis, receiving fees for its
     pickling services without acquiring ownership of the steel.
     
     Quality Control
     
     The Company carefully selects its raw material vendors and uses
     computerized inspection and analysis to assure that the steel
     and other metals which it processes will be able to meet the
     most critical specifications of its customers.  The Company
     uses documented procedures during the production process, along
     with statistical process control computers linked directly to
     processing equipment, to monitor that such specifications are
     met.  Physical, chemical and metallographic analyses are
     performed during the production process to verify that
     mechanical and dimensional properties, cleanliness, surface
     characteristics and chemical content are within specification.
     
     Suppliers and Raw Materials
     
     Steel and metal processing companies are required to maintain
     substantial inventories of raw materials in order to
     accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery
     requirements of their customers.  Accordingly, the Company
     generally maintains its inventory of raw materials at levels
     that it believes are sufficient to satisfy the anticipated
     needs of the customers based upon historic buying practices and
     market conditions.  The primary raw material processed by the
     Company is flat rolled steel purchased at regular intervals
     primarily from 18 major North American suppliers and a limited
     number of foreign steel companies.  The Company has no long-
     term commitments with any of its suppliers.
     
     Technical Services
     
     The Company employs a staff of engineers and other technical
     personnel and maintains fully-equipped, modern laboratories to
     support its operations.  These laboratories enable the Company to
     verify, analyze and document the physical, chemical, metallurgical and
     mechanical properties of its raw materials and products.  
     Technical service personnel also work in conjunction with the sales 
     force to determine the types of steel required for the particular needs of
     the Company's customers.

                                  7
<PAGE>
     Sales and Marketing
     
     The Company's products and services are sold primarily by
     Company sales personnel located throughout the United States
     and Mexico.  This marketing staff is supported by a vice
     president of sales for each of the Company's principal product
     lines.
     
     Customers and Distribution
     
     The Company has approximately 9,000 customers located
     throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico principally in
     the automotive, automotive supply, appliance, building and
     construction, machinery and steel industries.  Major customers
     include automobile manufacturers and suppliers, building and
     construction product distributors, and commercial and
     residential contractors.  No customer of the Company
     represented 10% or more of the Company's net sales for 1996,
     1997 or 1998.
     
     The Company manufactures its products exclusively to customer
     order rather than for inventory, except for building and
     construction products.  Although the Company negotiates annual
     sales orders with a majority of its customers, these orders are
     subject to customer confirmation as to product amounts and
     delivery dates.
     
     Competition
     
     The steel processing market is highly competitive.  The Company
     competes with a small number of other steel processors, some of
     which also focus on fully processed, high value-added steel
     products.  The Company competes on the basis of the precision
     and range of achievable tolerances, quality, price and the
     ability to meet delivery schedules dictated by customers.
     
     The Company also competes with a small number of other steel
     strapping manufacturers on the basis of quality, price, product
     variety and the ability to meet delivery schedules dictated by
     customers.
     
     The Company competes with numerous suppliers of building and
     construction products in its market on the basis of quality,

     Employees
     
     At December 31, 1998, the Company employed approximately 2,700
     people, of which approximately 200 are represented by
     collective bargaining agreements.
     
     Backlog
     
     Because of the nature of the Company's products and the short
     lead time order cycle, backlog is not a significant factor in
     the Company's business.  The Company believes that
     substantially all of its backlog of firm orders existing on
     December 31, 1998 will be shipped prior to the end of 1999.
     
     Governmental Regulation
     
     The Company's processing centers and manufacturing facilities
     are subject to many federal, state and local requirements
     relating to the protection of the environment.  The Company
     believes that it is in material compliance with all
     environmental laws, does not anticipate any material
     expenditures in order to meet environmental
     requirements and does not believe that future compliance with
     such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect
     on its results of operations or financial condition.
     
     The Company's operations are also governed by many other laws
     and regulations.  The Company believes that it is in material
     compliance with these laws and regulations and does not believe
     that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have
     a material adverse effect on its results of operations or
     financial condition.

     Item 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters
     
     As of  December 31, 1998, there were 140 shareholders of record
     of the Company's common stock.  However, the Company believes
     that it has a significantly higher number of shareholders
     because of the number of shares that are held by nominees.
     
     The Company's common stock is traded in the over-the-counter
     market and quoted on the National Association of Securities
     Dealers Automated Quotation System - National Market System
     ("Nasdaq").  Its trading symbol is "ROCK".  The following table
     sets forth the high and low sales prices per share for the
     Company's common stock for each quarter of 1998 and 1997:
     
            1998                         High            Low
            Fourth Quarter             $ 22 7/8        $15
            Third Quarter                23             14 3/8
            Second Quarter               25 1/4         20 1/2
            First Quarter                25 3/4         18 1/2

            1997
            Fourth Quarter            $  25 1/2        $17 3/4
            Third Quarter                28             20 3/4
            Second Quarter               25 1/2         18 7/8
            First Quarter                26 3/4         18 1/4
     
     The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock
     as it has been the Company's policy to invest earnings in the
     future development and growth of the Company.

     Results of Operations

     Year Ended 1998 Compared to Year Ended 1997
     
     Net sales increased $108.2 million, or 24%, to a record
     $557.9 million in 1998 from $449.7 million in 1997.  This
     increase primarily resulted from including the net sales
     of Solar (acquired March 1, 1998), Appleton (acquired
     April 1, 1998), USP (acquired June 1, 1998) and Harbor
     (acquired October 1, 1998) (collectively, the 1998
     acquisitions) from their respective acquisition dates with
     the net sales of the Company's existing operations, and
     from sales growth at existing operations.
     
     Cost of sales increased $80.9 million,  or 22%, to $456.4
     million in 1998 from $375.5 million in 1997.  Cost of
     sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 81.8% in
     1998 from 83.5% in 1997.  This improvement was due to the
     1998 acquisitions, which have historically generated
     higher margins than the Company's existing operations, and
     due to lower raw material costs at existing operations.
     
     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
     $15.5 million, or 37%, to $57.0 million in 1998 from $41.6
     million in 1997.  Selling, general and administrative
     expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 10.2%
     in 1998 from 9.2% in 1997.  This increase was primarily
     due to higher costs as a percentage of net sales due to
     acquisitions and performance based compensation linked to
     the Company's sales and profitability.
     
     Interest expense increased by  $6.3 million from 1997 to
     1998 primarily due to higher average borrowings during
     1998 as a result of current year acquisitions and capital
     expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in interest
     rates in the fourth quarter of 1998.
     
     As a result of the above, income before taxes increased by
     $5.6 million, or 20%, to a record $33.1 million in 1998
     from $27.5 million in 1997.
     
     Income taxes approximated $13.2 million in 1998, based on
     a 40.0% effective rate compared with a 40.3% effective
     rate in 1997.
     
     
     Year Ended 1997 Compared to Year Ended 1996
     
     Net sales increased by $106.7 million, or 31%, to $449.7
     million in 1997 from $343.0 million in 1996.  This
     increase primarily resulted from the inclusion of net
     sales of SEMCO (acquired January 1997) and sales growth at
     existing operations.
     
     Cost of sales increased $93.8 million, or 33%, to $375.5
     million in 1997 from $281.7 million in 1996.  Cost of
     sales increased to 83.5% of net sales in 1997 from 82.1%
     of net sales in 1996.  This increase was due to higher raw
     material costs which were not fully passed through to
     customers, partially offset by higher margins on SEMCO
     sales.
     
     Selling, general and administrative expense increased by
     $10.9 million, or 36%, to $41.6 million in 1997 from $30.6
     million in 1996.  As a percentage of net sales, selling,
     general and administrative expenses increased from 8.9% in
     1996 to 9.2% in 1997.  This increase was primarily due to
     higher costs as a percentage of sales attributable to
     SEMCO.
     
     Interest expense increased by $1.3 million from 1996 to
     1997 primarily due to higher average borrowings as a
     result of the SEMCO acquisition and capital expenditures.

     As a result of the above, income before taxes increased by
     $.7 million, or 3%, to $27.5 million in 1997 from $26.8
     million in 1996.
     
     Income taxes approximated $11.1 million in 1997, an
     effective rate of 40.3% in comparison with 40.4% in 1996.
     
     
     Liquidity and Capital Resources
     
     During 1998, the Company increased its working capital by
     $36.6 million to $124.2 million as a result of the
     addition of working capital from the 1998 acquisitions and
     due to working capital increases at the Company's existing
     operations.  As a result, the Company's current ratio
     improved to 3.4 to 1 at December 31, 1998 from 3.0 to 1 at
     December 31, 1997.  Long-term debt increased by $117.6
     million to $199.4 million and to 55% of total
     capitalization at December 31, 1998.  Additionally,
     shareholders' equity increased by 14% to $160.3 million.
     
     The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund
     its operations, including working capital requirements,
     the purchase and funding of improvements to its property
     and equipment, and to fund acquisitions.
     
     The Company's primary sources of liquidity are from cash
     provided by operating activities and the Company's
     revolving credit facility.  Net cash provided by
     operations of $13.3 million resulted primarily from net
     income of $19.8 million and depreciation and amortization
     of $13.3 million, offset by increases in accounts
     receivable and inventories of $11.7 million, necessary to
     service increased sales levels, and the decrease in
     accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.6 million.
     
     During 1998, the Company amended its revolving credit
     agreement with its bank group to increase the capacity of
     its revolver to $240 million and secure borrowings
     thereunder with its accounts receivable, inventories and
     property.  At December 31, 1998, the Company had five
     interest rate swap agreements outstanding which
     effectively converted $75 million of borrowings under the
     revolving credit agreement to fixed rates ranging from
     6.60% to 7.31% and which terminate at different dates
     beginning in November 2000.  The Company accounts for
     interest rate swap agreements on an accrual basis.
     Additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility
     carry interest at LIBOR plus a fixed rate.  The weighted
     average interest rate of these borrowings was 6.71% at
     December 31, 1998.
     
     Net cash provided by operations of $13.3 million combined
     with net proceeds from long-term debt of $107.3 million
     and $.6 million of cash on hand were primarily used for
     the acquisition of Solar, Appleton, USP and Harbor, and
     for capital expenditures.
     
     The Company believes that availability under its credit
     facility, together with funds generated from operations,
     will be more than sufficient to provide the Company with
     the liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund its
     anticipated working capital requirements, acquisitions and
     capital expenditure commitments for the next twelve
     months.
     
     The Company believes that environmental issues will not
     require the expenditure of material amounts for
     environmental compliance in the future.

     Impact of Year 2000
     
     The Year 2000 issue concerns the inability of some
     computer hardware and software to distinguish between the
     year 1900 and the year 2000.  If not corrected, computer
     applications could fail or create erroneous results.
     
     The Company is conducting a detailed assessment of all of
     its information technology and non-information technology
     hardware and software with regard to Year 2000 issues.
     The Company's plan to ensure that its systems are Year
     2000 ready is comprised of: cataloging all processes and
     systems which may have a date-related component and
     identifying those which are not Year 2000 ready;
     correcting or replacing those systems which are not Year
     2000 ready; and testing the corrected or replaced
     processes and systems to insure that they will, in fact,
     operate as desired according to Year 2000 requirements.
     The Company is in various stages of its Year 2000
     readiness process at each of its facilities and expects to
     complete testing of the corrected or replaced systems and
     be fully Year 2000 ready by July 1999.  In addition, the
     Company is working with its major customers and major
     vendors, including raw material suppliers and utility
     companies, to assess their internal state of Year 2000
     readiness.  These customer and vendor responses are
     evaluated for any possible risk to, or effect on, the
     Company's operations and are incorporated into its own
     detailed Year 2000 readiness assessment.
     
     Costs specifically associated with modifying internal use
     software for Year 2000 readiness are expensed as incurred
     but have not been, and are not expected to be, material to
     the Company's net income.  Costs of  replacing some of the
     Company's systems with Year 2000 ready systems have been
     capitalized as these new systems were acquired for
     business reasons and not to remediate Year 2000 problems,
     if any, in the former systems.
     
     Based upon the results of Year 2000 readiness efforts
     underway, the Company believes that all critical
     information and non-information technology systems and
     processes will be Year 2000 ready and allow the Company to
     continue operations beyond the Year 2000 without a
     material impact on its results of operations or financial
     position.  However, unanticipated problems which may be
     identified in the ongoing Year 2000 readiness process
     could result in an undetermined financial risk.
     Contingency plans to counter these unanticipated problems
     will be developed as part of the ongoing Year 2000
     readiness process.
     
                                   
     Recent Accounting Pronouncement
     
     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
     issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
     Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
     Activities (FAS No. 133) which requires recognition of the
     fair value of derivatives in the statement of financial
     position, with changes in the fair value recognized either
     in earnings or as a component of other comprehensive
     income dependent upon the hedging nature of the
     derivative.  Implementation of FAS No. 133 is required for
     fiscal 2000.  FAS No. 133 will not have a material impact
     on the Company's earnings or other comprehensive income.

                         Safe Harbor Statement
     
     The Company wishes to take advantage of the Safe Harbor
     provisions included in the Private Securities Litigation
     Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act").  Statements by the
     Company, other than historical information, constitute
     "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Act
     and may be subject to a number of risk factors.  Factors
     that could affect these statements include, but are not
     limited to, the following:  the impact of changing steel
     prices on the Company's results of operations; changing
     demand for the company's products and services; the impact
     of the Year 2000 issue; and changes in interest or tax
     rates.

            Company Responsibility For Financial Statements
                                   
                                   
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements of
     Gibraltar Steel Corporation have been prepared by
     management, which is responsible for their integrity and
     objectivity.  The statements have been prepared in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
     and include amounts based on management's best estimates
     and judgments.  Financial information elsewhere in this
     Annual Report is consistent with that in the consolidated
     financial statements.
     
     The Company has established and maintains a system of
     internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance
     that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records
     reflect the authorized transactions of the Company.
     
     The financial statements have been audited by
     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants.  As
     part of their audit of the Company's 1998 financial
     statements, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP considered the
     Company's system of internal control to the extent they
     deemed necessary to determine the nature, timing and
     extent of their audit tests.
     
     The Board of Directors pursues its responsibility for the
     Company's financial reporting through its Audit Committee,
     which is composed entirely of outside directors.  The
     independent accountants have direct access to the Audit
     Committee, with and without the presence of management
     representatives, to discuss the results of their audit
     work and their comments on the adequacy of internal
     accounting controls and the quality of financial
     reporting.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
     listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in
     all material respects, the financial position of
     Gibraltar Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries at
     December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their
     operations and their cash flows for each of the three
     years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting
     principles.  These financial statements are the
     responsibility of the Company's management; our
     responsibility is to express an opinion on these
     financial statements based on our audits.  We
     conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
     with generally accepted auditing standards which
     require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
     reasonable assurance about whether the financial
     statements are free of material misstatement.  An
     audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
     supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
     financial statements, assessing the accounting
     principles used and significant estimates made by
     management, and evaluating the overall financial
     statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
     provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
     above.

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   
                                   
                                   
       1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
       
       Principles of Consolidation
       
       The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
       of Gibraltar Steel Corporation and subsidiaries (the
       Company).  Significant intercompany accounts and
       transactions have been eliminated.
       
       
       Use of Estimates
       
       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
       generally accepted accounting principles requires management
       to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
       reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
       Actual results could differ from those estimates.
       
       
       Cash and Cash Equivalents
       
       Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, checking
       accounts and all highly liquid investments with a maturity
       of three months or less.
       
       
       Inventories
       
       Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost
       is determined using the first-in, first-out method.
       
       
       Property, Plant and Equipment
       
       Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and
       depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
       straight-line method.  Accelerated methods are used for
       income tax purposes.  Interest is capitalized in connection
       with construction of qualified assets.  Under this policy,
       interest of $404,000, $963,000 and $522,000 was capitalized
       in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
       
       
       Other Assets
       
       Goodwill is amortized over 35 years.  Amortization expense
       was $1,949,000, $880,000 and $557,000 in 1998, 1997, and
       1996, respectively.

       Shareholders' Equity
       
       In both July 1998 and 1997, the Company issued 11,000 of its
       common shares as a contribution to one of its profit sharing
       plans.
       
      Interest Rate Exchange Agreements
      
      Interest rate swap agreements, which are used by the Company in
      the management of interest rate risk, are accounted for on an
      accrual basis.  Amounts to be paid or received under interest
      rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense or
      income in the periods in which they accrue.  Swaps are not used
      for trading purposes.


       Income Taxes
       
       The financial statements of the Company have been prepared
       using the asset and liability approach in accounting for
       income taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax
       assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
       consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
       amounts and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities.
       
       
       Earnings Per Share
       
       Basic net income per share equals net income divided by the
       weighted average shares outstanding during the year.  The
       computation of diluted net income per share includes all
       dilutive common stock equivalents in the weighted average
       shares outstanding.
       
      2.  ACQUISITIONS
      
      On October 1, 1998, the Company purchased all the
      outstanding capital stock of Harbor Metal Treating Co.,

      services in which customer-owned parts are exposed to
      precise temperature and other conditions to improve
      their material properties, strength and durability.
      
      On June 1, 1998, the Company purchased all the
      outstanding common stock of United Steel Products
      Company (USP) for approximately $24 million in cash.
      USP designs and manufacturers steel lumber connector
      products for the building construction market.
      
      On April 1, 1998, the Company purchased the assets and
      business of Appleton Supply Co., Inc. (Appleton) for
      approximately $28 million in cash.  Appleton
      manufactures louvers, roof edging, soffitts and other

<PAGE>      
      These acquisitions have been accounted for under the
      purchase method. Results of operations of Harbor, USP,
      Appleton, Solar and SEMCO have been consolidated with
      the Company's results of operations from the respective
      acquisition dates. The aggregate excess of the purchase
      prices of these acquisitions over the fair market values
      of the net assets of the acquired companies is being
      amortized over 35 years from the acquisition dates using
      the straight-line method.
      
      The following information presents the pro forma
      consolidated condensed results of operations as if the
      acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 1997.  The pro
      forma amounts may not be indicative of the results that
      actually would have been achieved had the acquisitions
      occurred as of January 1, 1997 and are not necessarily
      indicative of future results of the combined companies.

</TABLE>
       
       In October 1998, the Company amended its debt agreement
       increasing its revolving credit facility to $240,000,000.
       The facility is secured by the Company's accounts
       receivable, inventories, property and equipment and is
       committed through April 2003.  This facility has various
       interest rate options which are no greater than the bank's
       prime rate.  In addition, the Company may enter into
       interest rate exchange agreements (swaps) to manage interest
       costs and exposure to changing interest rates.  At  December
       31, 1998 the Company had five interest rate swap agreements
       outstanding which effectively converted $75,000,000 of
       floating rate debt to fixed rates ranging from 6.60% to
       7.31% and which terminate at different dates beginning
       November 2000.  At December 31, 1998, additional borrowings
       consisted of $121,047,000 with an interest rate of LIBOR
       plus a fixed rate.  The weighted average interest rate of
       these borrowings was 6.71% at December 31, 1998.
       
       In addition, the Company has an Industrial Development
       Revenue Bond payable in equal installments through May 2002,
       with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a fixed rate (6.67% at
       December 31, 1998), which financed the cost of its Tennessee
       expansion under a capital lease agreement.  The cost of the
       facility and equipment equal the amount of the bond and
       includes accumulated amortization of $1,321,000.  The
       agreement provides for the purchase of the facility and
       equipment at any time during the term of the lease at
       scheduled amounts or at the end of the lease for a nominal
       amount.
       
       The aggregate maturities on long-term debt including lease
       purchase obligations for the five years following December
       31, 1998 are as follows: 1999, $1,351,000; 2000, $1,203,000;
       2001, $1,209,000; 2002, $825,000 and 2003, $196,102,000.
       
       The Company had no amounts outstanding under short-term
       borrowing for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.
       
       The various loan agreements, which do not require
       compensating balances, contain provisions that limit
       additional borrowings and require maintenance of minimum net
       worth and financial ratios. The Company is in compliance
       with the terms and provisions of all its financing
       agreements.

       Total cash paid for interest in the years ended December 31,
       1998, 1997 and 1996 was $11,257,000, $6,155,000 and
       $4,701,000, respectively.
       
       
       8.  LEASES
       
       The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
       operating leases.  Rent expense under operating leases for
       the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was
       $3,554,000, $3,771,000 and $2,358,000, respectively.  Future
       minimum lease payments under these operating leases are
       $2,899,000, $2,446,000, $2,159,000, $1,916,000 and
       $1,817,000 for the years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
       respectively, and $4,979,000 thereafter through 2038.
       
       
       9.  EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS
       
       During 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of
       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132
       Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and other Post-
       Retirement Benefits (FAS No. 132).  Adoption of FAS No. 132
       did not effect the Company's results of operations or
       financial position.
       
       Non-union employees participate in various profit sharing
       plans.  Contributions to these plans are funded annually and
       are based on a percentage of pretax income or amounts
       determined by the Board of Directors.
       
       Certain subsidiaries have multi-employer non-contributory
       retirement plans providing for defined contributions to
       union retirement funds.
       
       A supplemental pension plan provides defined pension
       benefits to certain salaried employees upon retirement.  Net
       unfunded periodic pension costs of $166,000 and $154,000
       were accrued under this plan in 1998 and 1997, respectively,
       and consisted primarily of service cost using a discount
       rate of 6.5% and 7.0%, respectively.
       
       Total expense for all retirement plans was $1,774,000,
       $1,258,000 and $1,066,000 for the years ended December 31,
       1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
       
       
       10.  OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS

       Certain subsidiaries of the Company provide health and life
       insurance to substantially all of their employees and to a
       number of retirees and their spouses.  The net periodic post-
       retirement benefit cost charged to expense consisting of
       service cost, interest cost and amortization of transition
       obligations was $255,000, $223,000 and $237,000 for the
       years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

       The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was
       determined using a weighted average discount rate of 6.5% in
       1998 and 7.0% in 1997.  The medical inflation rate was
       assumed to be 7% in 1998, with a gradual reduction to 5%
       over two years.  The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in
       the annual medical inflation rate would increase or decrease
       the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation at
       December 31, 1998 by approximately $371,000 and increase or

       The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
       Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (FAS No. 123).
       Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for
       the option plans as stock options granted under these plans
       have an exercise price equal to 100% of the market price on
       the date of grant.  If the compensation cost for these plans
       had been determined based on the fair value at the grant
       dates for awards consistent with the method of FAS No. 123,
       the pro forma effect on the years ended December 31, 1998
