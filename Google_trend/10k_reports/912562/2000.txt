                                 PART I

     Item 1. Description of Business

     General

     The Company is a processor of a broad array of high value-
     added, technically sophisticated steel and other metal
     products.  The Company utilizes any one or a combination
     of several different processes at each of its operating
     facilities to add substantial margin and value to raw
     material acquired from primary steel and other metal
     producers.  Underlying each of these processes is a common
     set of steel and metal processing core competencies.
     These core competencies are the foundation upon which all
     the Company's operations and customer offerings are based.

     Industry Overview

     Steel and metal processors occupy a market niche that
     exists between the primary steel and metal producers and
     end-users and others.  Primary steel and metal producers
     typically focus on the sale of standard size and tolerance
     steel and other metals to large volume purchasers,
     including steel and metal processors.  At the same time,
     end-users require steel with closer tolerances and with
     shorter lead times than the primary steel and metal
     producers can provide efficiently.

     Metal Processes, Products and Services

     The Company produces and delivers a variety of products
     and services on a just-in-time basis for  industrial
     manufacturers, fabricators and other end-users in the
     automotive, automotive supply, building and construction,
     machinery, and steel industries.

     The following table sets forth certain information
     regarding sales of products and services as a percentage
     of net sales for the past three years:
                                       Year ended December 31,

                                  2
<PAGE>
     The following steel and metal products, processes and
     services are provided by the Company:

     Cold-Rolled Strip Steel
     The Company produces a broad range of fully processed cold-
     rolled strip steel products.  The Company buys wide, open
     tolerance sheet steel in coils from primary steel producers
     and processes it to specific customer orders by performing
     such computer-aided processes as cold reduction, annealing,
     temper rolling, edge rolling and slitting.  Cold reduction
     is the rolling of steel to a specified thickness, tolerance
     and finish.  Annealing is a thermal process which changes
     hardness and certain metallurgical characteristics of steel.
     Temper rolling is the rolling of steel to a specific
     hardness.  Edge rolling involves conditioning edges of
     processed steel into square, fully round or partially round
     shapes.  Slitting is the cutting of steel to specified
     widths.  Depending on customer specifications, one or more
     of these processes are utilized to produce steel strip of a
     precise grade, temper, tolerance and finish.

     The Company operates 10 rolling mills at its facilities in
     Cleveland, Ohio, Chattanooga, Tennessee and Buffalo, New
     York, all of which are QS9000 certified, and is capable of
     rolling widths of up to 50 inches.  The Company has the
     capability to process coils up to a maximum of 72 inch
     outside diameter.  The Company's rolling mills include
     automatic gauge control systems with hydraulic screwdowns
     allowing for microsecond adjustments during processing.  The
     Company operates a 56 inch reversing mill which the Company
     believes is the widest of its type in the industry.

     The Company's computerized mills produce products meeting
     the most stringent statistical quality control standards,
     enabling it to satisfy a growing industry demand for a range
     of steel from thicker to thinner, low carbons to alloy
     grades, all with precision gauge tolerances as close as +/-
     .0002 inches.

     The Company's rolling facilities are further complemented by 15
     high convection annealing furnaces, which shorten annealing
     times over conventional annealers.  The Company's newest
     furnaces incorporate the use of a hydrogen atmosphere for the
     production of cleaner and more uniform steel.  As a result of
     its annealing capabilities, the Company is able to produce cold-
     rolled strip steel with improved consistency in terms of
     hardness, molecular grain structure and surface.

                              3
<PAGE>
     The Company can produce certain of its strip steel products
     on oscillated coils which wind the steel strip in a manner
     similar to the way thread is wound on a spool.  Oscillating
     the steel enables the Company to put at least six times
     greater volume of finished product on a coil than standard
     ribbon winding, allowing customers to achieve longer
     production runs by reducing the number of equipment shut-
     downs to change coils.  Customers are thus able to increase
     productivity, reduce downtime, improve yield and lengthen die
     life.

     Building and Construction Products
     The Company processes steel and other metal to manufacture
     a wide array of products for the building and construction
     industry.  Building and construction industry products are
     manufactured primarily from galvanized steel, as well as
     from aluminum, copper and other metals.  Building and
     construction products manufactured include metal trims,
     utility sheds, steel lumber connectors, metal roofing,
     drywall products, gutters and down spouts, ventilation
     products and storm panel systems for residential and
     commercial properties.

     The Company's existing building and construction products
     operations - comprised of Southeastern Metals
     Manufacturing Company, Inc. (SEMCO), with facilities
     located in Florida, Tennessee, Texas and Mississippi, The
     Solar Group (Solar), with three facilities located in
     Mississippi, Appleton Supply Co., Inc. (Appleton), with
     facilities located in Wisconsin and Missouri, and United
     Steel Products Company (USP), with facilities located in
     Minnesota, California, North Carolina and New Jersey -
     expanded during 1999 with the acquisition of two
     additional building and construction products companies.
     K & W Metal Fabricators, Inc., d/b/a Weather Guard
     Building Products (Weather Guard), acquired in July 1999,
     manufactures and distributes a full line of metals
     building products for industrial, commercial and
     residential applications.  With operations based in
     Colorado, Weather Guard strengthens the Company's business
     in the Western United States and provides a strong
     presence in the fast-growing Rocky Mountain region.
     Hughes Manufacturing, Inc. (Hughes), acquired in December
     1999, manufactures a broad line of fully engineered, code-
     approved steel lumber connectors and other metal hardware
     products at its Florida facility which compliment those
     produced by SEMCO.  Hughes' lumber connector products also
     compliment those produced at USP.

     Precision Metal Products
     The Company's precision metal products are comprised primarily of
     higher value-added flat-rolled sheet steel, as well as steel
     strapping and other products.

                               4
<PAGE>
     Precision Metal Processing.  The Company operates precision
     metals facilities in New York and Tennessee which primarily
     process flat-rolled sheet steel.  In addition to slitting and
     cutting to length, these precision metals facilities can produce
     higher value-added products which are held to close tolerances
     and tight specifications through cold-rolling, annealing,
     blanking, oscillating and edge rolling.

     The Company also operates precision metals facilities in
     Illinois and Alabama which process galvanized, Galvalume
     and prepainted steel and can slit and cut to length
     material based upon customer specifications.

     Steel Strapping.  Steel strapping is banding and packaging
     material that is used to close and reinforce shipping units
     such as bales, boxes, cartons, coils, crates and skids. The
     Company manufactures high tensile strapping that is subject to
     strength requirements imposed by the American Society for
     Testing and Materials for packaging of different products for
     common carrier transport.  This high tensile steel strapping is
     essential to producers of large, heavy products such as steel,
     paper and lumber where reliability of the packaging material is
     critical to the safe transport of the product.

     The Company's QS9000 certified strapping facility manufactures
     high tensile steel strapping by slitting, oscillating, heat
     treating, painting and packaging cold-rolled coils.

     Steel strapping is cold-rolled to precise gauge on one of the
     Company's rolling mills, which incorporates hydraulic screw
     downs and automatic gauge controls with statistical charting.
     This process ensures strapping product of the most uniform
     gauge available and produces the maximum amount of strapping
     per pound of steel.  All products are tested by on-site
     laboratory personnel for width, thickness and other physical
     and metallurgical properties.

     To meet the differing needs of its customers, the Company
     offers its strapping products in various thicknesses, widths
     and coil sizes.  The Company also manufactures custom color and
     printed strapping.  In addition, the Company offers related
     strapping products, such as seals and tools, and is able to
     manufacture tensional strapping for lighter duty applications.

     Other Products.  The Company's Solar operation produces a
     complete line of mailboxes manufactured primarily with
     galvanized steel.

                                5

     Heat Treating and Other Services
     Metallurgical Heat Treating Services.   The Company provides a
     wide range of metallurgical heat treating services  in which
     customer-owned parts are exposed to precise temperatures,
     atmospheres and quenchants and other conditions to improve
     their mechanical properties, durability and wear resistance.
     These services include case-hardening, neutral-hardening and
     through-hardening processes for customers in a wide variety of
     industries.  Using methods such as annealing, normalizing,
     vacuum hardening, carbonizing, nitriding and brazing, as well
     as a host of other services, these heat treating processes can
     harden, soften or otherwise impart desired properties on parts
     made of steel, copper and various alloys and other metals.

     During 1999, the Company acquired three heat treating
     companies - Southeastern Heat Treating, Inc. in April
     1999, Hi-Temp Incorporated (Hi-Temp) in August 1999 and
     Brazing Concepts Company (Brazing Concepts) in November
     1999 - and now operates fifteen heat treating facilities
     in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia,
     Alabama, Michigan, Indiana and Illinois.  The Company
     maintains a metallurgical laboratory at each facility with
     trained metallurgists providing a range of testing
     capabilities to add value to treated parts and enhance
     quality control.  Consistent quality control is maintained
     by application of a statistical process control system and
     registered to QS/ISO 9002.  Additionally, the Company
     maintains a fleet of trucks and trailers to provide rapid
     turnaround time for its customers.

     Due to time and costs associated with transporting
     materials and customers' need for just-in-time delivery of
     heat treated products, the commercial heat treating
     industry has developed as a regional industry concentrated
     in major industrial areas of the country.  In addition,
     the commercial heat treating industry has realized
     significant growth in recent years as many companies
     involved in the manufacture of metal components outsource
     their heat treating requirements.  The Company believes
     that its heat treating facilities are strategically
     located to meet the needs of customers from a
     geographically diverse base of operations and to
     capitalize on the growing trend in outsourcing of heat
     treating operations.

     Materials Management Services.  The Company operates two
     materials management facilities that link primary steel
     producers and end-user manufacturers by integrating the
     inventory purchasing, receiving, inspection, billing, storage
     and shipping functions and producing true just-in-time delivery
     of materials.  These facilities receive shipments of steel by
     rail and truck from steel producers, which retain ownership of
     the steel until it is delivered to the end-user manufacturer.
     The Company inspects the steel and stores it in a climate-
     controlled environment through the use of a specialized stacker
     crane and racking system.  When an order is placed, the Company
     often delivers the steel to the end-user manufacturer within
     one hour using Company-owned trucks that have been custom
     designed to facilitate the loading and unloading process.

                                6
<PAGE>
     Steel Pickling Joint Venture.  The Company is a minority
     partner with a 31% interest in two steel pickling operations in
     Ohio.  After the hot-rolling process, the surface of sheet
     steel is left with a residue known as scale, which must be
     removed prior to further processing by a cleaning process known
     as pickling.  This joint venture pickles steel on a toll basis,
     receiving fees for its pickling services without acquiring
     ownership of the steel.

     Quality Control

     The Company carefully selects its raw material vendors and uses
     computerized inspection and analysis to assure that the steel
     and other metals which it processes will be able to meet the
     most critical specifications of its customers.  The Company
     uses documented procedures during the production process, along
     with statistical process control computers linked directly to
     processing equipment, to monitor that such specifications are
     met.  Physical, chemical and metallographic analyses are
     performed during the production process to verify that
     mechanical and dimensional properties, cleanliness, surface
     characteristics and chemical content are within specification.

     Suppliers and Raw Materials

     Steel and metal processing companies are required to maintain
     substantial inventories of raw materials in order to
     accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery
     requirements of their customers.  Accordingly, the Company
     generally maintains its inventory of raw materials at levels
     that it believes are sufficient to satisfy the anticipated
     needs of the customers based upon historic buying practices and
     market conditions.  The primary raw material processed by the
     Company is flat rolled steel purchased at regular intervals
     primarily from approximately 20 major North American suppliers
     and a limited number of foreign steel companies.  The Company
     has no long-term commitments with any of its suppliers.

     Technical Services

     The Company employs a staff of engineers and other technical
     personnel and maintains fully-equipped, modern laboratories to
     support its operations.  These laboratories enable the Company to
     verify, analyze and document the
     physical, chemical, metallurgical and mechanical properties of
     its raw materials and products.  Technical service personnel also
     work in conjunction with the sales force to determine the types
     of steel required for the particular needs of the Company's
     customers.

                                7
<PAGE>
     Sales and Marketing

     The Company's products and services are sold primarily by
     Company sales personnel and outside sales representatives
     located throughout the United States and Mexico.

     Customers and Distribution

     The Company has approximately 9,000 customers located
     throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico principally in
     the automotive, automotive supply, appliance, building and
     construction, machinery and steel industries.  Major customers
     include automobile manufacturers and suppliers, building and
     construction product distributors, and commercial and
     residential contractors.  No customer of the Company
     represented 10% or more of the Company's net sales for 1997,
     1998 or 1999.

     The Company manufactures its products exclusively to customer
     order rather than for inventory, except for building and
     construction products.  Although the Company negotiates annual
     sales orders with a majority of its customers, these orders are
     subject to customer confirmation as to product amounts and
     delivery dates.

     Competition

     The steel processing market is highly competitive.  The Company
     competes with a small number of other steel processors, some of
     which also focus on fully processed, high value-added steel
     products.  The Company competes on the basis of the precision
     and range of achievable tolerances, quality, price and the
     ability to meet delivery schedules dictated by customers.

     The Company also competes with a small number of other steel
     strapping manufacturers on the basis of quality, price,
     products, range of sizes offered and the ability to meet
     delivery schedules dictated by customers.

     The Company competes with numerous suppliers of building and
     construction products in its market based on the broad range of
     products offered, quality, price and delivery.

                              8

     The Company competes with a small number of suppliers of heat
     treating services in its market areas on the basis of processes
     offered, quality, price, and delivery.
     Employees

     At December 31, 1999, the Company employed approximately 3,100
     people, of which approximately 300 are represented by
     collective bargaining agreements.

     Backlog

     Because of the nature of the Company's products and the short
     lead time order cycle, backlog is not a significant factor in
     the Company's business.  The Company believes that
     substantially all of its firm orders existing on December 31,
     1999 will be shipped prior to the end of 2000.

     Governmental Regulation

     The Company's processing centers and manufacturing facilities
     are subject to many federal, state and local requirements
     relating to the protection of the environment.  The Company
     believes that it is in material compliance with all
     environmental laws, does not anticipate any material
     expenditures in order to meet environmental
     requirements and does not believe that future compliance with
     such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect
     on its results of operations or financial condition.

     The Company's operations are also governed by many other laws
     and regulations.  The Company believes that it is in material
     compliance with these laws and regulations and does not believe
     that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have
     a material adverse effect on its results of operations or
     financial condition.

     Item 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder
     Matters

     As of  December 31, 1999, there were 137 shareholders of record
     of the Company's common stock.  However, the Company believes
     that it has a significantly higher number of shareholders
     because of the number of shares that are held by nominees.

     The Company's common stock is traded in the over-the-counter
     market and quoted on the National Association of Securities
     Dealers Automated Quotation System - National Market System
     ("Nasdaq").  Its trading symbol is "ROCK".  The following table
     sets forth the high and low sales prices per share for the
     Company's common stock for each quarter of 1999 and 1998:

                                 1999                   1998
                           High       Low          High       Low
          Fourth Quarter  $ 26      $ 21 3/4    $ 22 7/8    $ 15
          Third Quarter     25 3/4    20 1/8      23          14 3/8
          Second Quarter    25 1/4    19 3/4      25 1/4      20 1/2
          First Quarter     23 1/2    17          25 3/4      18 1/2

     The Company declared dividends of $.05 per share in the first
     quarter of 1999 and $.025 per share in each of the second,
     third and fourth quarters of 1999.  No dividends were declared
     in 1998.

     Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
              and Results of Operations

     Results of Operations

     Year Ended 1999 Compared to Year Ended 1998

     Net sales increased $64.0 million, or 11.5%, to a record
     $621.9 million in 1999 from $557.9 million in 1998.  This
     increase primarily resulted from including the net sales
     of Southeastern Heat Treating (acquired April 1, 1999),
     Weather Guard (acquired July 1, 1999), Hi-Temp (acquired
     August 1, 1999), Brazing Concepts (acquired November 1,
     1999) and Hughes (acquired December 1, 1999) (the 1999
     acquisitions) from their respective acquisition dates, and
     a full year of net sales of Solar (acquired March 1,
     1998), Appleton (acquired April 1, 1998), USP (acquired
     June 1, 1998) and Harbor (acquired October 1, 1998) (the
     1998 acquisitions), together with sales growth at existing
     operations.

     Cost of sales increased $37.5 million, or 8.2%, to $493.9
     million in 1999 from $456.4 million in 1998.  Cost of
     sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 79.4% in
     1999 from 81.8% in 1998.  This improvement was due to the
     1999 and 1998 acquisitions, which have historically
     generated higher margins than the Company's existing
     operations, and due to lower raw material costs at
     existing operations.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
     $15.5 million, or 27.1%, to $72.5 million in 1999 from
     $57.0 in 1998.  Selling, general and administrative
     expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.7%
     in 1999 from 10.2% in 1998.  This increase was due to
     higher costs as a percentage of net sales attributable to
     the 1999 and 1998 acquisitions, and due to performance
     based compensation linked to the Company's sales and
     profitability.

     Interest expense increased by $2.0 million from 1998 to
     1999 primarily due to higher borrowings in 1999 as a
     result of the Company's current year acquisitions and
     capital expenditures and due to a higher effective
     interest rate in 1999 than in 1998.

     As a result of the above, income before taxes increased
     $9.0 million, or 27.1%, to a record $42.0 million in 1999
     from $33.1 million in 1998.

     Income taxes approximated $17.0 million in 1999, based on
     a 40.5% effective rate compared with a 40.0% effective
     rate in 1998.


     Year Ended 1998 Compared to Year Ended 1997

     Net sales increased $108.2 million, or 24%, to $557.9
     million in 1998 from $449.7 million in 1997.  This
     increase primarily resulted from including the net sales
     of Solar (acquired March 1, 1998), Appleton (acquired
     April 1, 1998), USP (acquired June 1, 1998) and Harbor
     (acquired October 1, 1998) (the 1998 acquisitions) from
     their respective acquisition dates with the net sales of
     the Company's existing operations, and from sales growth
     at existing operations.

     Cost of sales increased $80.9 million,  or 22%, to $456.4
     million in 1998 from $375.5 million in 1997.  Cost of
     sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 81.8% in
     1998 from 83.5% in 1997.  This improvement was due to the
     1998 acquisitions, which have historically generated
     higher margins than the Company's existing operations, and
     due to lower raw material costs at existing operations.

                             14
<PAGE>
     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
     $15.5 million, or 37%, to $57.0 million in 1998 from $41.6
     million in 1997.  Selling, general and administrative
     expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 10.2%
     in 1998 from 9.2% in 1997.  This increase was primarily
     due to higher costs as a percentage of net sales due to
     acquisitions and performance based compensation linked to
     the Company's sales and profitability.

     Interest expense increased by  $6.3 million from 1997 to
     1998 primarily due to higher average borrowings during
     1998 as a result of current year acquisitions and capital
     expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in interest
     rates in the fourth quarter of 1998.

     As a result of the above, income before taxes increased by
     $5.6 million, or 20%, to $33.1 million in 1998 from $27.5
     million in 1997.

     Income taxes approximated $13.2 million in 1998, based on
     a 40.0% effective rate compared with a 40.3% effective
     rate in 1997.


     Liquidity and Capital Resources

     During 1999, the Company's working capital decreased to
     $112.9 million due to an increase in accounts payable to
     support higher sales levels and an increase in accrued
     income taxes.  Long-term debt increased by $35.9 million
     to $235.3 million and to 56% of total capitalization at
     December 31, 1999.  Additionally, shareholders' equity
     increased by 16% to $185.5 million.

     The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund
     its operations, including working capital requirements,
     the purchase and funding of improvements to its property
     and equipment, and to fund acquisitions.

     The Company's primary sources of liquidity are from cash
     provided by operating activities and the Company's
     revolving credit facility.  Net cash provided by
     operations of $60.7 million resulted primarily from net
     income of $25.0 million, depreciation and amortization of
     $17.5 million, a decrease in inventory of $6.9 million,
     exclusive of acquisitions, and an increase in accounts
     payable and accrued expenses of $10.2 million.

     During 1999, the Company amended its revolving credit
     agreement with its bank group to increase the capacity of
     its revolver to $280 million.  Borrowings thereunder are
     secured with its accounts receivable, inventories and
     property and equipment.  At December 31, 1999, the Company
     had interest rate swap agreements outstanding which
     effectively converted $75 million of borrowings under the
     revolving credit agreement to fixed rates ranging from
     6.37% to 7.08% and which terminate at different dates
     beginning in November 2000.  The Company accounts for
     interest rate swap agreements on an accrual basis.
     Additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility
     carry interest at LIBOR plus a fixed rate.  The weighted
     average interest rate of these borrowings was 7.07% at
     December 31, 1999.

     Net cash provided by operations of $60.7 million combined
     with net proceeds from long-term debt of $26.9 million
     were primarily used for the acquisition of Southeastern
     Heat Treating, Weather Guard, Hi-Temp, Brazing Concepts
     and Hughes, and for capital expenditures.

                             15

     The Company believes that availability under its credit
     facility, together with funds generated from operations,
     will be more than sufficient to provide the Company with
     the liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund its
     anticipated working capital requirements, acquisitions and
     capital expenditure commitments for the next twelve
     months.

     The Company believes that environmental issues will not
     require the expenditure of material amounts for
     environmental compliance in the future.


     Impact of Year 2000

     The Year 2000 issue concerns the ability of computer
     hardware and software to distinguish between the year
     1900 and the year 2000.  An inability to make this
     distinction could result in computer application failure.

     During 1999, the Company completed a detailed assessment
     of all its information technology and non-information
     technology hardware and software with regard to the Year
     2000 issue, with special emphasis on mission critical
     systems.  Information and non-information technology
     hardware and software were inventoried and those not Year
     2000 ready were identified, remediated (i.e., corrected
     or replaced) and tested to ensure that they would, in
     fact, operate as desired according to Year 2000
     requirements.  The Company expensed approximately
     $500,000 during 1999 in connection with remediating its
     systems.

     As a result of its Year 2000 readiness efforts, the
     Company's mission critical information technology and non-
     information technology systems successfully distinguished
     between the year 1900 and the year 2000 on January 1,
     2000, without any mission critical application failure.
     However, the Company will continue to monitor its mission
     critical computer applications throughout the year 2000
     to ensure that any latent Year 2000 matters that may
     arise are addressed promptly.


     Recent Accounting Pronouncement

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
     issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
     133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
     Activities (FAS No. 133) which requires recognition of
     the fair value of derivatives in the statement of
     financial position, with changes in the fair value
     recognized either in earnings or as a component of other
     comprehensive income dependent upon the hedging nature of
     the derivative.  Implementation of FAS No. 133 is
     required for fiscal 2001.  FAS No. 133 will not have a
     material impact on the Company's earnings or other
     comprehensive income.


                         Safe Harbor Statement

     The Company wishes to take advantage of the Safe Harbor
     provisions included in the Private Securities Litigation
     Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act").  Statements by the
     Company, other than historical information, constitute
     "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Act
     and may be subject to a number of risk factors.  Factors
     that could affect these statements include, but are not
     limited to, the following:  the impact of changing steel
     prices on the Company's results of operations; changing
     demand for the company's products and services; the impact
     of the Year 2000 matter; and changes in interest or tax
     rates.

            Company Responsibility For Financial Statements


     The accompanying consolidated financial statements of
     Gibraltar Steel Corporation have been prepared by
     management, which is responsible for their integrity and
     objectivity.  The statements have been prepared in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
     and include amounts based on management's best estimates
     and judgments.  Financial information elsewhere in this
     Annual Report is consistent with that in the consolidated
     financial statements.

     The Company has established and maintains a system of
     internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance
     that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records
     reflect the authorized transactions of the Company.

     The financial statements have been audited by
     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants.  As
     part of their audit of the Company's 1999 financial
     statements, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP considered the
     Company's system of internal control to the extent they
     deemed necessary to determine the nature, timing and
     extent of their audit tests.

     The Board of Directors pursues its responsibility for the
     Company's financial reporting through its Audit Committee,
     which is composed entirely of outside directors.  The
     independent accountants have direct access to the Audit
     Committee, with and without the presence of management
     representatives, to discuss the results of their audit
     work and their comments on the adequacy of internal
     accounting controls and the quality of financial
     reporting.

                   Report of Independent Accountants



     To the Board of Directors and
     Shareholders of Gibraltar Steel Corporation

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
     listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in
     all material respects, the financial position of
     Gibraltar Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries at
     December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
     operations and their cash flows for each of the three
     years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in
     conformity with accounting principles generally
     accepted in the United States.  These financial
     statements are the responsibility of the Company's
     management; our responsibility is to express an
     opinion on these financial statements based on our
     audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements
     in accordance with auditing standards generally
     accepted in the United States, which require that we
     plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
     assurance about whether the financial statements are
     free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
     amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
     assessing the accounting principles used and
     significant estimates made by management, and
     evaluating the overall financial statement
     presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
     reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                      GIBRALTAR STEEL CORPORATION

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


       1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       Principles of Consolidation

       The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
       of Gibraltar Steel Corporation and subsidiaries (the
       Company).  Significant intercompany accounts and
       transactions have been eliminated.

       Use of Estimates

       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
       generally accepted accounting principles requires management
       to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
       reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
       Actual results could differ from those estimates.

       Cash and Cash Equivalents

       Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, checking
       accounts and all highly liquid investments with a maturity
       of three months or less.

       Inventories

       Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost
       is determined using the first-in, first-out method.

       Property, Plant and Equipment

       Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and
       depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
       straight-line method.  Accelerated methods are used for
       income tax purposes.  Interest is capitalized in connection
       with construction of qualified assets.  Under this policy,
       interest of $357,000, $404,000 and $963,000 was capitalized
       in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

       Goodwill

       Goodwill is amortized over 35 years.  Amortization expense
       was $2,647,000, $1,949,000 and $880,000 in 1999, 1998, and
       1997, respectively.  Accumulated amortization was $6,251,000
       and $3,604,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998.

       Shareholders' Equity

       In 1999, 1998 and 1997, the Company issued 20,572, 11,000
       and 11,000, respectively, of its common shares as
       contributions to its profit sharing plans.

       During 1999, the Company declared dividends of $1,568,000,
       of which $315,000 is accrued at December 31, 1999.

                                 24

       Interest Rate Exchange Agreements

      Interest rate swap agreements, which are used by the Company in
      the management of interest rate risk, are accounted for on an
      accrual basis.  Amounts to be paid or received under interest
      rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense or
      income in the periods in which they accrue.  Swaps are not used
      for trading purposes.

       Income Taxes

       The financial statements of the Company have been prepared
       using the asset and liability approach in accounting for
       income taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax
       assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
       consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
       amounts and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities.

       Earnings Per Share

       Basic net income per share equals net income divided by the
       weighted average shares outstanding during the year.  The
       computation of diluted net income per share includes all
       dilutive common stock equivalents in the weighted average
       shares outstanding.

      2.  ACQUISITIONS

       On December 1, 1999, the Company purchased all the

      construction products as well as a complete line of
      mailboxes, manufactured primarily with galvanized steel.

      These acquisitions have been accounted for under the
      purchase method with the results of their operations
      consolidated with the Company's results of operations
      from the respective acquisition dates. The aggregate
      excess of the purchase prices of these acquisitions over
      the fair market values of the net assets of the acquired
      companies is being amortized over 35 years from the
      acquisition dates using the straight-line method.

      The following information presents the pro forma
      consolidated condensed results of operations as if the
      acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 1998.  The pro
      forma amounts may not be indicative of the results that
      actually would have been achieved had the acquisitions
      occurred as of January 1, 1998 and are not necessarily
      indicative of future results of the combined companies.

       In 1999, the Company amended its debt agreement increasing
       its revolving credit facility to $280,000,000.  The facility
       is secured by the Company's accounts receivable,
       inventories, and property and equipment and is committed
       through April 2003.  This facility has various interest rate
       options which are no greater than the bank's prime rate.  In
       addition, the Company may enter into interest rate exchange
       agreements (swaps) to manage interest costs and exposure to
       changing interest rates.  At  December 31, 1999 the Company
       had  interest rate swap agreements outstanding which
       effectively converted $75,000,000 of floating rate debt to
       fixed rates ranging from 6.37% to 7.08% and which terminate
       at different dates beginning November 2000.  At December 31,
       1999, additional borrowings consisted of $153,128,000 with
       an interest rate of LIBOR plus a fixed rate.  The weighted
       average interest rate of these borrowings was 7.07% at
       December 31, 1999.

       In addition, the Company has Industrial Development Revenue
       Bonds payable in installments through September 2018, with
       interest rates ranging from a fixed rate of 4.22% to
       variable rates of up to 7.10% at December 31, 1999, which
       financed the cost of its Tennessee expansion and the
       expansion of the Coldwater, Michigan facility, both under
       capital lease agreements.  The cost of the facilities and
       equipment equal the amount of the bonds and include
       accumulated amortization of $1,648,000.  The agreements
       provide for the purchase of the facilities and equipment at
       any time during the lease terms at scheduled amounts or at
       the end of the leases for nominal amounts.

       The aggregate maturities on long-term debt including lease
       purchase obligations for the five years following December
       31, 1999 are as follows: 2000, $1,319,000; 2001, $1,469,000;
       2002, $1,289,000; 2003, $228,752,000; and 2004, $629,000.

       The Company had no amounts outstanding under short-term
       borrowing for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.

       The various loan agreements, which do not require
       compensating balances, contain provisions that limit
       additional borrowings and require maintenance of minimum net
       worth and financial ratios. The Company is in compliance
       with the terms and provisions of all its financing
       agreements.

       Total cash paid for interest in the years ended December 31,
       1999, 1998 and 1997 was $13,357,000, $11,257,000 and
       $6,155,000, respectively.

       8.  LEASES

       The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under
       operating leases.  Rent expense under operating leases for
       the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was
       $4,899,000, $3,554,000 and $3,771,000, respectively.  Future
       minimum lease payments under these operating leases are
       $4,514,000, $3,979,000, $3,108,000, $2,615,000 and
       $1,758,000 for the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
       respectively, and $6,985,000 thereafter through 2038.

       9.  EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS

       Non-union employees participate in various profit sharing
       plans.  Contributions to these plans are funded annually and
       are based on a percentage of pretax income or amounts
       determined by the Board of Directors.

       Certain subsidiaries have multi-employer non-contributory
       retirement plans providing for defined contributions to
       union retirement funds.

       A supplemental pension plan provides defined pension
       benefits to certain salaried employees upon retirement.  Net
       unfunded periodic pension costs of $199,000 and $166,000
       were accrued under this plan in 1999 and 1998, respectively,
       and consisted primarily of service cost using a discount
       rate of 8.0% and 6.5%, respectively.

                                  28
<PAGE>

       Total expense for all retirement plans was $1,957,000,
       $1,774,000 and $1,258,000 for the years ended December 31,
       1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

       During 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of
       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132
       Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and other Post-
       Retirement Benefits (FAS No. 132).  Adoption of FAS No. 132
       did not effect the Company's results of operations or
       financial position.

       10.  OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS

       Certain subsidiaries of the Company provide health and life
       insurance to substantially all of their employees and to a
       number of retirees and their spouses.  The net periodic post-
       retirement benefit cost charged to expense consisting of
       service cost, interest cost and amortization of transition
       obligations was $291,000, $255,000 and $223,000 for the
       years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

       The approximate unfunded accumulated post-retirement benefit
       obligation at December 31, consists of the following (in
       thousands):

   Benefit Obligation  Service  Interest  Actuarial  Benefit  Benefit Obligation
      at January 1      Cost      Cost   (Gain)/Loss Payments  at December 31

1999   $2,105             90      135        (445)      (41)       $1,844
1998   $1,808             76      125         152       (56)       $2,105

       The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was
       determined using a weighted average discount rate of 8.0% in
       1999 and 6.5% in 1998.  The medical inflation rate was
       assumed to be 7% in 1999 and to decrease to 5% in 2000 and
       thereafter.  The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the
       annual medical inflation rate would increase or decrease the
       accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation at December
       31, 1999 by approximately $320,000 and $271,000,
       respectively, and increase or decrease the annual service
       and interest costs by approximately $40,000.

       One of the Company's subsidiaries also provides post-
       retirement health care benefits to its unionized employees
       through contributions to a multi-employer health care plan.

       The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
       Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (FAS No. 123).
       Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for
       the option plans as stock options granted under these plans
       have an exercise price equal to 100% of the market price on
       the date of grant.  If the compensation cost for these plans
       had been determined based on the fair value at the grant
       dates for awards consistent with the method of FAS No. 123,
       the unaudited pro forma effect on the years ended December
       31, 1999 and 1998 is as follows:

                          As Reported   Pro forma   As Reported   Pro forma
                             1999         1999         1998          1998

       Net Income         $25,008,000   $23,566,000  $19,840,000  $18,976,000

       The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used to estimate
       the fair value of the options granted on the date of grant.
       The fair values and assumptions used in the model, assuming
       no dividends, are as follows:


                             Expected    Stock       Risk-Free     Dividend
                  Fair Value   Life    Volatility  Interest Rate     Yield
       1999 Grant   $9.18     5 years    45.1%          4.4%          .2%
       1998 Grant   $7.74     5 years    43.7%          4.4%            -
       1997 Grant   $9.77     5 years    40.2%          6.1%            -

       The Company also has a Restricted Stock Plan reserved for
       issuance of 100,000 common shares for the grant of
       restricted stock awards to employees and non-employee
       directors at a purchase price of $.01 per share.  In 1997,
       4,000 shares were awarded to non-employee directors under
       this plan and in 1998, 55,000 shares were awarded to
       employees.

       14.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

       The Company is a party to certain claims and legal actions
       generally incidental to its business.  Management does not
       believe that the outcome of these actions, which is not
       clearly determinable at the present time, would
       significantly affect the Company's financial condition or
       results of operations.

                    ARTICLE II.   The Credit

          2.1  Revolving Credit.

               (a)  Advances.  Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and relying upon the
representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement, and provided that there has been no material
adverse change in the financial condition of the
Borrower or the Company, each Bank, severally and for
itself alone, agrees that it will, from time to time
during the period commencing on the date the conditions
specified in Section 3.1 are satisfied through the
Business Day preceding the Termination Date, make one
or more Advances ("Advance" or collectively "Advances")
to the Borrower equal to its Percentage of the
aggregate amount of Advances requested by Borrower from
all Banks up to the dollar amount set forth opposite
the name of each Bank on Schedule 1 hereto (which
amount, with respect to each Bank, shall be called its
"Commitment"); provided, however, no Bank shall be
required or permitted to make any Advance or
participate in any Letter of Credit if, after giving
effect thereto, the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of all Advances and the aggregate face amount of
Letters of Credit issued ("Revolving Credit") would
exceed Two Hundred sixty  Million Dollars
($260,000,000.00) at any one time outstanding.  Subject
to Section 2.5 hereof, the Advances may be repaid and
reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof;
provided, however, no further Advances shall be made on
or after the Termination Date, at which time the
Revolving Credit must be paid in full.

               (b)  Method for Borrowing Advances.  If
and when the Borrower wishes the Banks to make Advances
available, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the
Business Day on which the Advances are to be funded.
The Borrower shall specify (i) the aggregate amount of
the Advances to be made on a designated date, which
shall be at least $100,000.00 and (ii) the proposed
date on which the Advances are to be funded, which
shall be a Business Day.  Upon receipt of such notice
from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each of the Banks thereof.  Each Bank
shall make an amount equal to such Bank's
Percentage of the requested Advance available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at
the Administrative Agent's Office not later than
1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the designated date of the
Advance, in immediately available funds.  As early as
practically possible, but not later than 3:00 p.m. (New
York time) on the date on which the Advance is to be
made and upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth
<PAGE>
in Article III of this Agreement, the Administrative
Agent will make the proceeds of such Advance available
to the Borrower.

               Neither the Administrative Agent nor any
Bank shall incur any liability to the Borrower in
acting upon any notice referred to above or
subsection 2.1(c) by telephone which the Administrative
Agent or such Bank believes in good faith to have been
given by a duly authorized officer or other person
authorized to borrow on behalf of the Borrower or for
otherwise acting in good faith.

               (c)  Swingloans.  Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, relying upon the
representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement, and so long as the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of all Advances and the aggregate face
amount of Letters of Credit issued are Two Hundred
Sixty Million Dollars ($260,000,000.00) or less, Chase
agrees to make to the Borrower one or more Swingloans
("Swingloan" or collectively "Swingloans") as requested
by the Borrower during the period commencing on the
date the conditions specified in Section 3.1 are
satisfied through the Business Day preceding the
Termination Date in an amount which will not exceed
Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) at any one time
outstanding.  At such time and for as long as the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Advances
and the aggregate face amount of Letters of Credit
issued are more than Two Hundred Sixty Million Dollars
($260,000,000.00), the Borrower will not request, and
Chase will not make a Swingloan.  The Banks other than
Chase will not participate in nor be obligated to
advance Swingloans.  The obligation of Chase to make
Swingloans shall automatically terminate on the date of
any reduction in the Commitments in accordance with
Section 2.11 or the cancellation of the Commitments
pursuant to Section 7.2

               If and when the Borrower wishes Chase to
make a Swingloan, the Borrower shall notify Chase not
later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business
Day on which the Swingloan is to be made of the amount
of the Swingloan desired, which shall be at least
$50,000.00, Chase shall determine and advise the
Borrower promptly of the per annum fixed rate option
applicable to the Swingloan, which rate shall be the
fluctuating interest rate per annum for each day on
overnight Federal funds transactions with members of
the Federal Reserve System, plus 150 basis points
("Fixed Rate").  The Borrower shall immediately notify
Chase if the Swingloan is to bear interest at the Fixed
Rate or the Prime Rate, which notice shall be
irrevocable.  Each Swingloan, together with the
interest accrued thereon, shall be prepaid by the
Borrower prior to the close of business on the Business
Day immediately following the Business Day on which
such Swingloan is made.
<PAGE>
               (d)  The Revolving Note.  The Advances
made by each Bank shall be evidenced by a note of the
Borrower to each Bank with blanks appropriately
completed in the form of Exhibit C annexed hereto and
made a part hereof ("Revolving Note").  Each Swingloan
made by Chase shall be evidenced by a separate note
payable to the order of Chase.

          Each Note shall be inscribed by the Bank as
holder of the Note on the reverse side thereof or any
continuation thereof with the outstanding principal
balance of the Advance by such Bank, and, in the case
of Chase, with the outstanding principal balance of the
Swingloan, and any such inscription shall constitute
prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information
so recorded; provided, however, the failure of any Bank
to make any such inscription shall not affect the
Company's obligations under the Note of such Bank or
this Agreement.

          2.2  Letters of Credit.

               (a)  Letters of Credit.  Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and relying upon
the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement, Chase upon application of the Borrower,
shall from time to time during the period commencing on
the date the conditions specified in Section 3.1 are
satisfied through the date which is two (2) Business
Days preceding the Termination Date issue Letters of
Credit on behalf of the Banks for the account of the
Borrower, the Company or any Subsidiary in an aggregate
face amount of Letters of Credit outstanding at any one
time not to exceed $5,000,000.00 and each of which
shall have an expiration date which may extend after
the Termination Date but shall not exceed one year from
date of issuance; provided, however, at the request of
the Borrower or the Company, as applicable, Chase may
extend the maturity date of any Letter of Credit for
additional periods not exceeding one year each; and
provided further, Chase will not issue any Letter of
Credit if, after giving effect thereto, (i) the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Advances
and the aggregate face amount of Letters of Credit
outstanding would exceed $260,000,000.00, as such
amount may be reduced by an amount designated by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof, or (ii) the
Percentage of any Bank of its Commitment would be
exceeded upon its purchase of an undivided interest in
such Letter of Credit as provided in Section 2.2(d)
hereof.  Each Bank's Commitment shall be used by its
Percentage of the outstanding face amount of each
Letter of Credit upon the issuance thereof.

                    Each Letter of Credit shall
(i) provide for the payment of drafts in United States
dollars, be presented for honor thereunder by the
beneficiary in accordance with the terms thereof, at
sight when accompanied by the documents described
therein, and (ii) otherwise be in form and substance
<PAGE>
satisfactory to Chase as the issuer of the Letter of
Credit.  Upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit,
Chase shall deliver the original of such Letter of
Credit to the beneficiary thereof at the direction of
the Borrower and advise each Bank of the issuance.  Any
Bank which believes a Letter of Credit has been issued
in violation of this Section 2.2(a) shall promptly,
after discovery of the relevant facts, notify Chase in
writing.

               (b)  Application by the Borrower for
Issuance of the Letters of Credit.  The Borrower shall
request Chase in writing to issue the Letters of Credit
by delivering to Chase on or before the date hereof, in
the case of Letters of Credit to be issued on the date
hereof, or two Business Days prior to the proposed date
of issuance, in the case of all other Letters of Credit
to be issued hereunder, a Letter of Credit application
in form and content satisfactory to Chase specifying
the account party and completed to the satisfaction of
Chase and such other certificates, documents and other
papers and information as Chase may reasonably request.
Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Credit, Chase
shall advise each Bank of the receipt of an
application.

               (c)  Letter of Credit Fees.  The
Borrower agrees to pay the Administrative Agent for the
accounts of the Banks upon the application by the
Borrower for and the issuance by Chase of any Letter of
Credit, a fee, which fee shall be determined by Chase
at the time of issuance of a Letter of Credit.

               (d)  Participation in Letters of Credit.
  Chase hereby sells to each Bank, and each Bank hereby
purchases from Chase, without recourse to Chase (except
as to payments to be made by the Administrative Agent
to such Bank under Section 2.2(c)), an undivided
interest in each Letter of Credit and in each letter of
credit fee payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each
case equal to such Bank's Percentage thereof.

                    Upon any drawing under a Letter of
Credit drawn in strict compliance with the requirements
of the Letter of Credit as determined by Chase in its
sole discretion, for the payment of which the Borrower
has not otherwise made funds available, the
Administrative Agent shall notify each of the Banks of
the date of payment of the drawing and the dollar
amount of each Bank's Percentage interest therein.
Such payment by Chase under any Letter of Credit shall
constitute Advances by the Banks subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement pertaining thereto
other than Section 3.2.

                    The obligation of each Bank to
remit the amount of its Advance to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to a drawing under a Letter of Credit in
<PAGE>
accordance with this Section shall be unconditional and
irrevocable under any and all circumstances (unless the
payment of such drawing was the result of Chase's gross
negligence or willful misconduct or such Letter of
Credit was issued in violation of Section 2.2(a)
hereof) and may not be terminated, suspended or delayed
for any reason notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, including the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or Event of Default.

               (e)  Obligation to Reimburse.  Chase
will promptly notify by telephone the Borrower of any
draft drawn pursuant to a Letter of Credit and
presented for payment and of the date Chase intends to
pay such draft; if that is the case.  With respect to
any draft paid pursuant to a Letter of Credit, the
Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent the amount of such payment on the date of payment
by depositing with the Administrative Agent prior to
10:00 a.m. (New York time) immediately available funds
in the amount of such draft.  The failure to so deposit
shall be deemed a request for Advances in an aggregate
amount equal to the amount paid.

               (f)  Unconditional Obligations.  In
order to induce Chase to issue the Letters of Credit
and the Banks to participate therein, the Borrower
agrees that neither Chase nor any Bank shall be
responsible or liable for, and the Borrower's
unconditional obligation to reimburse the
Administrative Agent for the accounts of the Banks for
amounts paid on account of drawings honored under
Letters of Credit shall not be affected by (i) the
validity, sufficiency or genuineness of any document or
instrument presented to Chase in connection with a
Letter of Credit, even if such document or instrument
should in fact prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged, or
(ii) any action taken or omitted by Chase without gross
negligence or willful misconduct in connection with
making or not making payment under the Letter of
Credit.

          2.3  [Intentionally Omitted]

          2.4  Interest.

               (a)  The Credit.  The Advances under the
Revolving Credit (other than the Swingloans) shall bear
interest on the unpaid principal amount from time to
time unpaid until maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) at a per annum rate of interest equal to the
Base Rate ("Base Rate Loan").  The rate of interest on
the Base Rate Loans evidenced by the Revolving Note
shall change simultaneously with each change in the
Prime Rate and shall change each Business Day with any
change in the Federal Funds Rate.

               Subject to Section 2.7 hereof, the
Borrower may elect to convert any portion of a Base
Rate Loan to a LIBOR Loan or to continue any LIBOR Loan
as a new LIBOR Loan by giving irrevocable notice of
<PAGE>
such election to the Administrative Agent by 10:00 a.m.
(New York time) at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the requested Conversion Date and, in the case of
the continuation of any LIBOR Loan, such conversion or
continuation shall take place on the last day of the
applicable LIBOR Period with respect to the LIBOR Loan
being so continued.  The Administrative Agent shall
promptly give each of the Banks notice of the
Borrower's election.  Each such request to convert or
continue shall include the Rate Option, the requested
Conversion Date (which shall be a Business Day), the
LIBOR Period selected with respect to any LIBOR Loan,
and the amount to be converted or continued (which
shall be in a principal amount of not less than
$500,000.00 and an integral multiple of $100,000.00 in
the case of conversion to or continuation as a LIBOR
Loan.  If no Default nor Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing at such time, such conversion or
continuation shall be made on the requested Conversion
Date, subject to the foregoing limitations in
connection with the conversion or continuation of LIBOR
Loans.

               The Administrative Agent shall not incur
any liability to the Borrower in acting upon telephonic
notice referred to above which the Administrative Agent
believes to have been given by a duly authorized
officer or other person authorized to and on behalf of
the Borrower or for otherwise acting under this Section
2.4(a).

               (b)  LIBOR Increment.  The LIBOR
Increment, which is the percentage utilized in
determining LIBOR, shall be determined in accordance
with the Credit Pricing Agreement.

               (c)  Computation of Interest.  Interest
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for
the actual number of days elapsed, which will result in
a higher effective annual rate.  Interest shall be
payable on the first day of each March, June, September
and December commencing December 1, 1997 and, in the
case of a LIBOR Loan, interest shall also be payable on
the last day of each applicable LIBOR Period, if
earlier, and on any Conversion Date.

               (d)  Default Rate.  After maturity,
whether by acceleration or otherwise, Borrower shall
pay interest at a per annum rate equal to two percent
(2%) plus the Prime Rate.  In no event shall the rate
of interest exceed the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law.  If Borrower pays interest in excess of
the amount permitted by applicable law, such excess
shall be applied in reduction of the principal of
Advances made pursuant to this Agreement.

               (e)  Late Charge. Upon failure to make
any payment of interest or principal hereunder when
due, Borrower promises to pay a late charge computed as
follows:
<PAGE>
                    (1)  Late charges may be assessed
each day on the amount overdue based upon the Prime
Rate from day to day.  The formulas for the daily late
charge assessment will be as follows:

                         (i)  For overdue interest:

(Amount overdue) x 110% x (the Prime Rate + 2%)
                    365



                         (ii) For overdue principal:

(Amount overdue) x 10% x (the Prime Rate + 2%)
                    365

                    (2)  If the sum of the late charges
computed as in (1) is less than Ten Dollars ($10.00), a
minimum late charge of Ten Dollars ($10.00) per late
payment may be assessed.

               The assessment and/or collection of late
charges shall in no way impair the right to pursue any
other remedies hereunder.

          2.5  Prepayment.

               (a)  Base Rate Loans.  The Borrower
shall have the right to prepay at any time without
premium all or any portion of the Advances consisting
of Base Rate Loans, together with interest on the
principal so prepaid to the date of such prepayment.
Any partial prepayment of principal shall be in the
amount of $100,000.00 or an integral multiple thereof.

               (b)  LIBOR Loans.  The Borrower shall
have the right to prepay without premium all or any
portion of the Advances consisting of LIBOR Loans on
the expiration day of the applicable LIBOR Period.  If
any LIBOR Loan is prepaid at any other time, the
Borrower shall, upon not less than ten (10) days prior
written notice, pay to the Administrative Agent an
amount equal to (i) the interest which would have
otherwise been payable on the amount prepaid during the
remaining term of the LIBOR Period, less (ii) interest
on the amount prepaid for such term computed at an
interest rate equal to the yield-to-maturity which
could be obtained on United States Treasury
obligations, purchased in the market at the time of
prepayment, having a remaining term and coupon rate
comparable to the remaining term of the LIBOR Period,
and comparable to the applicable interest rate, as
determined by the Administrative Agent in good faith,
and certified to the Borrower, such certificate to be
conclusive, absent manifest error.  Any partial
prepayment of principal shall be in the amount of
$100,000.00 or an integral multiple thereof.
<PAGE>
(c)  Mandatory Prepayment From Subordinated Debt.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, if the Borrower incurs any Subordinated
Debt, the Borrower shall immediately use the proceeds
thereof to prepay outstanding Advances.  Such proceeds
shall be used first to prepay Base Rate Loans until all
Base Rate Loans are paid in full and then to prepay
LIBOR Loans.  If any LIBOR Loans are so prepaid, the
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent the
additional amounts set forth in subsection (b) above.
Upon any prepayment required pursuant to this
subsection (c), the Borrower shall have the option to
reduce the Commitment pursuant to Section 2.11 of this
Agreement.

          2.6  Use of Proceeds and Letters of Credit.
The Borrower covenants to the Banks that it will use
the proceeds advanced under this Agreement subsequent
to the initial Advance for general working capital, for
loans to and investments in its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to the extent permitted under Section 6.8
hereof and for the financing of Capital Expenditures
and Expansions, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions
of stock or assets of, or investments in a joint
venture of partnership with, any third Person permitted
by Section 6.7 hereof or otherwise consented to by the
Administrative Agent with the agreement of the Majority
Banks.

          2.7  Special Provisions Governing LIBOR Loans
               - Increased Costs.

               (a)  In the event that on any LIBOR
Interest Determination Date, any Bank shall notify the
Administrative Agent that it shall have determined
(which determination shall be final, conclusive and
binding) that:

                    (1)  by reason of conditions in the
London interbank market or of conditions affecting the
position of any Bank in such market occurring after the
date hereof, adequate fair means do not exist for
establishing LIBOR, or

                    (2)  by reason of (i) any
applicable law or governmental rule, regulation,
guideline or order (or any written interpretation
thereof and including any new law or governmental rule,
regulation, guideline or order but excluding any of the
foregoing relating to taxes referred to in Section 2.9
of this Agreement) or (ii) other circumstances
affecting any Bank or the London interbank market or
the position of any Bank in such market (such as, but
not limited to, official reserve requirements), LIBOR
does not represent the effective pricing to any Bank
for U.S. dollar deposits of comparable amounts for the
relevant period due to such increased costs then, the
Administrative Agent shall give a notice by telephone,
confirmed in writing, to the Borrower of such
determination.
<PAGE>
               (b)  Thereafter, the Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative Agent upon written request
therefor, such additional amounts as the Administrative
Agent in its sole discretion, shall reasonably
determine to be required to compensate the Bank for
such increased costs.  A certificate as to such
additional amounts submitted to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent shall, absent manifest error, be
final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto.

               (c)  In lieu of paying such additional
amounts as required by this Section 2.7, the Borrower
may exercise the following options:

                    (1)  If such determination relates
only to a conversion to a LIBOR Loan then being
requested by the Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof,
the Borrower may, on such LIBOR Interest Determination
Date by giving notice by telephone to the
Administrative Agent, withdraw such request.

                    (2)  The Borrower may, by giving
notice by telephone to the Administrative Agent require
the Administrative Agent to convert the LIBOR Loan then
being requested to a Base Rate Loan, or to convert its
outstanding LIBOR Loan that is so affected into a Base
Rate Loan at the end of the then current LIBOR Period.

          2.8  Required Termination and Repayment of
LIBOR Loans.

               (a)  In the event any Bank shall notify
the Administrative Agent that it shall have reasonably
determined, at any time (which determination shall be
final, conclusive and binding but shall be made only
after consultation with the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent), that the making or continuation
of any or all of LIBOR Loans by such Bank:

                    (1)  has become unlawful by
               compliance by such Bank in good faith
               with any applicable law, governmental
               rule, regulation, guideline or order, or

                    (2)  would cause such Bank severe
               hardship as a result of a contingency
               occurring after the date of this
               Agreement which materially and adversely
               affects the London interbank market(such
               as, but not limited to disruptions
               resulting from political or economic
               events);

               then, and in either such event, the
Administrative Agent shall on such date (and in any
event as soon as possible after making such
determination) give telephonic notice to the Borrower,
confirmed in writing, of such determination,
identifying which of the LIBOR Loans are so affected.
<PAGE>
               (b)  The Borrower shall, upon the
termination of the then current LIBOR Period applicable
to each LIBOR Loan so affected or, if earlier, when
required by law, repay each such affected LIBOR Loan,
together with all interest accrued thereon.

               (c)  In lieu of the repayment required
by Section 2.8(b), the Borrower may exercise the
following options:

                    (1)  If the determination by the
Bank relates only to a LIBOR Loan then being converted
by the Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof, the
Borrower may, on such date by giving notice by
telephone to the Administrative Agent, withdraw such
request for conversion.

                    (2)  The Borrower may, by giving
notice by telephone to the Administrative Agent,
require the Banks to convert the LIBOR Loan then being
converted to a Base Rate Loan or to convert any
outstanding LIBOR Loan or LIBOR Loans that are so
affected into a Base Rate Loan at the end of the then
current LIBOR Period (or at such earlier time as
repayment is otherwise required to be made pursuant to
section 2.7(b)).  Such notice shall pertain only to the
LIBOR Loan or LIBOR Loans outstanding or to be
outstanding during each such affected LIBOR Period.

          2.9  Taxes.  If any taxes (other than taxes
with respect to the income of the Banks), or duties of
any kind shall be payable, or ruled to be payable, by
or to any taxing authority of or in the United States,
or any foreign country, or any political subdivision of
any thereof, in respect of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, but not
limited to, execution, delivery performance,
enforcement, or payment of principal or interest of or
under the Note or this Agreement, or the making of a
LIBOR Loan), by reason of any now existing or hereafter
enacted statute, rule, regulation or other
determination (excluding any taxes imposed on or
measured by the net income of the Banks), the Borrower
will:

               (1)  pay on written request therefor all
such taxes or duties, including interest and penalty,
if any,

               (2)  promptly furnish the Administrative
Agent with evidence of any such payment, and

               (3)  indemnify and hold the Banks and
any holder or holders of the Note harmless and
indemnified against any liability or liabilities with
respect to or in connection with any such taxes or the
payment thereof or resulting from any delay or omission
to pay such taxes.

          2.10 Unused Line Fee.  The Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Banks a per annum Unused Line Fee (based on a 360 day
<PAGE>
year) on the average unused amount of the Commitments,
which Unused Line fee shall be payable quarterly, in
arrears, on the last day of each September, December,
March and June to and including the Termination Date.
The Unused Line Fee shall be computed in accordance
with the provisions of the Credit Pricing Agreement.

          2.11 Reduction.  The Borrower may, at any
time by written notice to the Administrative Agent
state its desire to reduce the Commitments of the Banks
to any amount which is not less than the aggregate then
outstanding principal amount of Advances and the
undrawn face amount of Letters of Credit.  Any such
reduction shall be pro-rata in order that the
Percentage of each Bank's Commitment is not changed.
Any reductions of the Commitments shall not be
reinstated at any future date and any partial reduction
shall be in the amount of $5,000,000.00 or an integral
multiple thereof.  Immediately upon receipt of such
notice by the Administrative Agent, the obligation of
each of the Banks to make Advances and to participate
in Letters of Credit hereunder shall be limited to its
Commitment as reduced pursuant to such notice.

          2.12 Administrative Agent's Fee.  The
Borrower agrees to pay the Administrative Agent an
agent's fee in the amount set forth in a letter from
the Administrative Agent to the Company dated
October 14, 1994, payable annually, by November 15,
upon the satisfaction of the conditions specified in
Section 3.1 and on each annual anniversary of such date
thereafter until all of the Indebtedness created
pursuant to this Agreement has been paid in full.

          2.13 Payments.  All payments by the Borrower
under this Agreement of interest, principal, fees and
other expenses shall be made in immediately available
funds not later than 12:00 p.m. on the due date at the
Administrative Agent's Office, unless such amount is
paid by the Administrative Agent's debiting a deposit
account of the Borrower.  All such payments applicable
to the Swingloans shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to Chase on the same Business Day.
All such other payments, other than the Administrative
Agent's fee, shall be remitted by the Administrative
Agent to each of the Banks on the same Business Day in
accordance with its Percentage.

          2.14 Sharing of Payments.  If any Bank shall
obtain any payment or other recovery or receive any
collateral (whether voluntary, involuntary, by
application of setoff or otherwise) on account of any
Advances or any participation in a Letter of Credit in
excess of its pro rata share of payments or collateral
then or therewith obtained by all Banks, such Bank
shall purchase from the other Banks such participations
in Advances or Letters of Credit, or shall provide such
other Banks with the benefits of any such collateral or
the proceeds thereof as shall be necessary to cause
such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment or
<PAGE>
other recovery ratably with each of them; provided,
however, if all or any portion of such excess payment
or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Bank,
such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price
and benefits returned to the extent of such recovery,
without interest.

          The Borrower agrees that each of the other
Banks so purchasing a portion of such Bank's interest
in Advances or participations in Letters of Credit may
exercise all rights (including, but not limited to,
rights of setoff) with respect to such portion
purchased as if such other Banks were the direct
holders thereof.  The Borrower agrees that each Bank
shall have a security interest in and the right to set
off as against any outstanding Advances and all other
of the Borrower's liabilities under this Agreement with
respect to any deposit account or other obligation of
the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

          Each of the Banks agree that (a) if the
unpaid principal balances of the Revolving Note are not
paid in full at the close of business on the
Termination Date, or (b) if the maturity of the
Revolving Note is accelerated and the Credit is
terminated in accordance with Section 7.2 hereof (the
earlier of such dates being referred to as the
"Purchase Date"), the Bank or Banks receiving payment
at a rate based on the applicable percentage(s) in
excess of similar payments received by any other Bank
shall immediately give notice to the Administrative
Agent of such payment and shall purchase for cash
within thirty (30) Business Days from the Purchase
Date, from any Bank receiving payment at a lesser rate,
an interest in the Revolving Credit in such amounts so
that each Bank shall own an interest in the aggregate
amount of the Revolving Credit then outstanding equal
to its Percentage, plus, if such amount is not paid by
the purchasing Bank within the specified period,
interest thereon shall accrue at the rate equal to the
Federal Funds Rate for the period commencing on the
Purchase Date and ending on the actual date of payment
thereof.

          2.15 Replacement Bank.  The Borrower may
replace any Bank (a "Replaced Bank") by designating
another bank which is reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent (such Bank being herein called a
"Replacement Bank").  Simultaneously with payment of
all amounts owing to the Replaced Bank hereunder or in
connection herewith, the Replaced Bank shall assign to
the Replacement Bank in accordance with Section 10.3
and without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to,
such Replaced Bank all of the rights and obligations of
such Replaced Bank hereunder (except for the rights as
survive repayment of the Advances).  Upon such
assignment such Replaced Bank shall no longer be a
party to this Agreement or have any rights hereunder
and shall be relieved from all obligations to the
Borrower, the Company, the Administrative Agent or the
Banks, and the Replacement Bank shall succeed to the
rights and obligations of such Replaced Bank.

any basis therefor, which, if adversely determined,
would, in any case or in the aggregate, materially
adversely affect the property, assets, financial
condition or business of the Company on a Consolidated
basis or materially impair the right or ability of the

                    Administrative Agent and the Banks

          8.1  Appointment and Authorization.  Each
Bank hereby appoints The Chase Manhattan Bank as the
Administrative Agent to act as Administrative Agent in
connection with the administration of the Credit and
the Guaranties and for such purpose, subject to
specific restrictions herein including Sections 7.2 and
8.3, irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such action and to exercise such rights, powers
and discretions as are specifically delegated to the
Administrative Agent in this Agreement and the
Guaranties, together with all rights, powers and
discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto,
including, without limitation, the power to execute
financing or similar statements or notices and other
related documents relating to the transactions
contemplated by the Guaranties.  The Administrative
Agent may perform any of its functions and duties under
this Agreement or the Guaranties for the benefit of all
the Banks by or through any agents or any of its
directors, officers or employees.  In performing any of
its functions and duties under this Agreement or the
Guaranties, the Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to be acting as a trustee for, or partner of,
any Bank or to have assumed any relationship of agency,
trust or partnership with or for the Borrower.  In
administering the Letters of Credit, Chase will use the
same degree of care and skill as it exercises in the
administration of letters of credit in which no
participations are sold, but it shall not be under any
liability to any Bank except for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct and except as stated
in Section 2.2(d).  Chase agrees that it will honor
each drawing under a Letter of Credit in strict
compliance with the requirements of the Letter of
Credit under which it is drawn.

          8.2  No Other Duties.  Neither Chase nor the
Administrative Agent shall have any duties or
obligations other than those expressly provided for in
this Agreement and the Guaranties, and neither Chase,
the Administrative Agent, nor any of their directors,
officers, employees or agents, shall be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in connection with
this Agreement, the Guaranties, and other documents
related thereto, the negotiation, preparation or
execution thereof, or in connection with the
syndication, implementation or administration of the
Credit, the Guaranties, unless directly resulting from
Chase's, the Administrative Agent's, or such
directors', officers', employees' or agents' gross
negligence or willful misconduct.  The duties of the
Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and
administrative in nature; the Administrative Agent
shall be responsible to all the Banks for the filing
and refiling of statements to perfect and to continue
the perfection of the Security Interests; the
Administrative Agent shall not, by reason of this
Agreement or the Guaranties, have a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Bank; and nothing in
<PAGE>
this Agreement or the Guaranties, expressed or implied,
is intended or shall be construed to impose upon Chase
or the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect
of this Agreement or any document in connection
herewith or the Guaranties except as expressly set
forth herein in such documents and this Agreement.

          8.3  Copies and Notice of Event of Default or
Default.  The Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly
forward to each Bank a copy of any notice or document
received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) promptly notify each
Bank of the occurrence of any Event of Default or
Default of which the Administrative Agent has actual
knowledge; and (iii) consult with and secure the
written consent of the Majority Banks with respect to
the enforcement of this Agreement, the Revolving Note
and the Guaranties.

          8.4  Certain Rights of Chase and the
Administrative Agent.

               (a)  If Chase or the Administrative
Agent shall request instructions from the Majority
Banks with respect to any act or action (including
failure to act) in connection with this Agreement, the
Guaranties or any other document related thereto, Chase
and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
refrain from such act or taking such action unless and
until it shall have received instructions from the
Majority Banks; and neither Chase nor the
Administrative Agent shall incur liability to any
Person by reason of so refraining.  Chase and the
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action hereunder or
under this Agreement, the Guaranties, or any document
related thereto (i) if such action would, in its
opinion, be contrary to law or the terms of this
Agreement, the Guaranties, or any document related
thereto, (ii) if it shall not receive such advice or
concurrence of the Majority Banks as it deems
appropriate in accordance with the terms hereof, or
(iii) if it shall not first be indemnified to its
reasonable satisfaction against any and all liability
and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action.  Without
limiting the foregoing, no Bank shall have any right of
action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a
result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining
from acting hereunder, under the Guaranties, or under
any document related thereto, in accordance with the
instructions of the Majority Banks.

               (b)  Chase and the Administrative Agent
may, without liability to the Borrower or any Bank,
(i) rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram,
telecopy, telephone notice, telex or teletype message,
statement, order or other document or conversation
believed by Chase or the Administrative Agent to be
<PAGE>
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or
made by the Person or Persons by whom it purports to
have been communicated or signed and (ii) employ in
Administrative Agent's sole discretion and rely on the
advice and opinions received by them from any
professional adviser, including, without limitation,
legal counsel, independent accountants or other
experts, whether or not such professional adviser was
selected by the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower
and each Bank hereby waives any claim or action it may
have against the Administrative Agent or Chase arising
out of or resulting from such employment or reliance,
except in the case of Chase's or the Administrative
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

               (c)  All moneys realized by the
Administrative Agent from any payment or other recovery
from the Borrower, the Company or any Subsidiary from
any of the Guaranties or otherwise shall be applied by
the Administrative Agent against the following in
following priority:  first, to costs and expenses of
Chase, the Administrative Agent or any Bank which are
reimbursable by the Borrower or otherwise pursuant to
this Agreement and the Revolving Note;  second, to
interest on the Revolving Note and fees payable to the
Banks and the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Agreement; third, to the unpaid principal balances of
the Revolving Note and the outstanding unreimbursed
face amounts of any Letters of Credit; and fourth, any
remaining moneys shall be paid over to such other
Person as is entitled thereto.

          8.5  Waiver of Liability of Administrative
Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any
liability or, as the case may be, any duty or
obligation:

               (a)  To the Borrower or the Company on
account of any failure of any Bank other than the
Administrative Agent to perform, or the delay of any
Bank other than the Administrative Agent in the
performance of, any of its respective obligations under
this Agreement, the Guaranties or any of the other
documents in connection herewith;

               (b)  To any Bank on account of any
failure or delay in performance by either the Borrower,
the Company or any Subsidiary of any of its obligations
under this Agreement, the Guaranties or any of the
other documents in connection herewith unless such
failure or delay is a result of the Administrative
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct;

               (c)  To any Bank for (i) the accuracy of
any written or oral statements furnished or made by the
Borrower, the Company or by any Person (including the
Administrative Agent) on behalf of the Borrower or the
Company in connection with the Credit, (ii) the
accuracy of any representation, warranty or statement
made by the Borrower in or pursuant to this Agreement,
<PAGE>
the Guaranties or any of the other documents in
connection herewith, or (iii) the legality, validity,
effectiveness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement, the Guaranties, any other document in
connection herewith, or any other document referred to
herein;

               (d)  To any Bank to provide either
initially or on a continuing basis (except as expressly
required by Section 8.3 and 8.6 hereof) any information
with respect to the Borrower or its condition, or for
analyzing or assessing or omitting to analyze or assess
the status, creditworthiness or prospects of the
Borrower, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

               (e)  To any Bank to investigate whether
or not any Default or Event of Default has occurred
(and the Administrative Agent may assume that, until
Administrative Agent shall have actual knowledge or
shall have received notice from any Bank, the Company
or the Borrower to the contrary, no such Default or
Event of Default has occurred);

               (f)  To any Bank to account for any sum
or profit or any property of any kind received by
Administrative Agent arising out of any present or
future banking or other relationship with the Borrower
or with any other Person except the relationship
established pursuant to this Agreement or the
Guaranties;

               (g)  To any Bank to disclose to any
Person any information relating to the Borrower, the
Company or any other Subsidiary received by
Administrative Agent if, in Administrative Agent's
determination (such determination to be conclusive),
such disclosure would or might constitute a breach of
any law or regulation or be otherwise actionable by
suit against Administrative Agent by the Borrower or
any other Person;

               (h)  Other than as expressly required by
this Agreement or as expressly agreed to by the Banks,
to take any action or refrain from taking any action;
and

               (i)  To commence any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or the Guaranties until Administrative Agent
shall have been indemnified by the Borrower or by the
Banks according to their Percentages to Administrative
Agent's satisfaction against any and all costs, claims
and expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys'
fees and expenses) in respect of such legal action or
proceeding.

          8.6  Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and
Other Banks.  Each Bank expressly acknowledges that the
Administrative Agent has not made any representations
or warranties to such Bank and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of the Borrower, shall be deemed
<PAGE>
to constitute any representation or warranty by the
Administrative Agent to any Bank.  Each Bank represents
to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or
any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the financial
condition, creditworthiness, affairs, status and nature
of the Borrower and the Company, and made its own
decision to enter into this Agreement, and each Bank
hereby releases the Administrative Agent from any and
all liability to such Bank in connection with the
Administrative Agent's investigation and appraisal of
the Borrower's or the Company's financial affairs,
financial condition, and creditworthiness.  Each Bank
also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Bank, and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make
its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement or the
Guaranties and to make such investigation as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the status and
affairs, financial or otherwise, of the Borrower and
the Company.  The Administrative Agent shall not be
required to keep itself informed as to the performance
or observance by the Borrower and the Company of this
Agreement, the Guaranties or any other document
referred to or provided for herein or to inspect the
properties or books of the Borrower, the Company or any
of its other Subsidiaries.  Except for notices,
reports, and other documents and information expressly
required to be furnished to each of the Banks by the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement or the
Guaranties, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty
or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit
or other information concerning the affairs, financial
condition or business of the Borrower, the Company or
any of its other Subsidiaries which may come into the
possession of the Administrative Agent.

          8.7  Indemnification.  Each Bank agrees to
indemnify Chase, in its capacity as issuer of Letters
of Credit and the Administrative Agent in its capacity
as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower
or the Company), as well as its directors, officers,
employees or agents, ratably according to its
respective Percentage from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including, without limitation, those expenses
specified in Article IX hereof which may at any time
(including, without limitation, at any time following
the payment of the Revolving Note) be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against Chase or the
Administrative Agent, its directors, officers,
<PAGE>
employees or agents, in any way relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Guaranties or any action
taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent, its
directors, officers, employees or agents, under or in
connection with any of the foregoing; provided,
however, that no Bank shall be liable for the payment
of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent that
they result from the Administrative Agent's or Chase's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The agreements
in this Section 8.7 shall survive the payment of the
Revolving Note, the expiration or other termination of
the Letters of Credit and the termination of this
Agreement and the Guaranties.

          8.8  Administrative Agent in Its Individual
Capacity.  The Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity and its affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of
business with the Borrower, the Company and any of its
other Subsidiaries as though the Administrative Agent
were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

          8.9  Successor Administrative Agent.  The
Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to all the Banks, the Borrower,
and the Company.  Upon any such resignation, Fleet Bank
shall have the right to become the successor
Administrative Agent.  If, however, within ten (10)
days upon receiving notice of the Administrative
Agent's resignation Fleet Bank does not accept the
position as successor Administrative Agent by giving
written notice thereof to all the Banks, the Borrower,
and the Company, then the Majority Banks shall have the
right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent other
than Fleet Bank.  If no successor Administrative Agent
shall have been so appointed by the Majority Banks and
shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30)
days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving
of notice of resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of all the Banks,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent.  Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such
successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed
to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges, duties and obligations of the retiring
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations thereafter under this Agreement.
Administrative Agent shall continue to perform its
duties hereunder until a successor Administrative Agent
shall have been appointed and accepts such appointment
in writing.  After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation, the provisions of this Article VIII,
including, without limitation, the indemnity provisions
of Section 8.7 hereof, shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

          8.10 Benefit of Article VIII.  The provisions
of this Article VIII are intended solely for the
<PAGE>
benefit of Chase, the Administrative Agent and all the
Banks and may be modified by mutual agreement of Chase,
the Administrative Agent and all of the Banks.  The
Borrower, the Company and its other Subsidiaries shall
not be entitled to rely on any such provisions or
assert any such provisions in a claim, or as a defense,
against the Administrative Agent or any Bank.

       ARTICLE IX.   Indemnification - Costs and Expenses

          9.1  Indemnification.  The Borrower and the
Company agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
Chase, the Administrative Agent and each of the Banks
from and against any and all liabilities, claims,
damages, penalties, expenditures, losses, or charges,
including, but not limited to, all costs of
investigation, monitoring, legal representation,
remedial response, removal, restoration or permit
acquisition, which may now or in the future be
undertaken, suffered, paid, awarded, assessed, or
otherwise incurred by Chase, the Administrative Agent,
any of the Banks or any other Person as a result of the
presence of, Release of or threatened Release of
Hazardous Substances on, in, under or near the property
owned or operated by the Company or any Subsidiary.
The liability of the Borrower and the Company under the
covenants of this Section and Article II are not
limited by any exculpatory provisions in this Agreement
or any other documents securing the Credit and shall
survive repayment of the Revolving Note, expiration or
other termination of the Letters of Credit or any
transfer or termination of this Agreement regardless of
the means of such transfer or termination.

          9.2  Expenses.  The Borrower shall reimburse
the Administrative Agent and each of the Banks promptly
for all of their respective reasonable counsel fees
incurred in connection with this Agreement and with any
indebtedness subject hereto and for any taxes, filing
fees, recording fees and appraisal fees which the
Administrative Agent may be required to pay in
connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Revolving Note and the Guaranties.  The
Borrower shall further reimburse the Administrative
Agent and each of the Banks promptly for any reasonable
expenses, including counsel fees and out-of-pocket
expenses, incident to the monitoring, examination and
administration of the collateral subject to the
Security Agreements during the term of this Agreement
and to the enforcement of any provision of this
Agreement, the Revolving Note, the Guaranties or any
other document executed in connection with this
Agreement.  Without limiting the Borrower's obligation
to reimburse the Administrative Agent and each of the
Banks pursuant to this Section 9.2, the Borrower hereby
irrevocably authorizes the Banks to make Advances to
the Borrower and to use the proceeds thereof to pay any
amount owed by the Borrower under this Section 9.2 upon
the failure of the Borrower to make such payment, and
the Administrative Agent agrees to notify the Borrower
<PAGE>
of the making of such Advances.  Any such Advances
shall be made in the minimum amount necessary.

                  ARTICLE X.    Miscellaneous

          10.1  Amendments and Waivers.  No
modification, rescission, waiver, release or amendment
of any provision of this Agreement or any Security
Documents shall be made except by a written agreement
subscribed by duly authorized officers of the Borrower,
the Company and the Administrative Agent with the
consent of the Majority Banks; provided, however, no
such amendment, modification or waiver:

                (a) which would modify any requirement
that any particular action to be taken hereunder by or
on behalf of the Banks shall be taken by all Banks or
by the Majority Banks so as to reduce the number of
Banks required to take such action shall be effective
unless consented to by each Bank;

                (b) which would amend this Section or
which would increase any Bank's Commitment or
Percentage, reduce the Facility Fee, extend the
Termination Date or release any of the Guaranties shall
be made without the consent of each Bank;

                (c) which would extend the due date
for, or reduce the amount of, any payment or prepayment
of principal of or interest on any note (or reduce the
principal amount of or rate of interest on any note)
shall be made without the consent of each Bank; or

                (d) which would affect adversely the
interests, rights or obligations of the Administrative
Agent shall be made without the consent of the
Administrative Agent.

          10.2  Delays and Omissions.  No course of
dealing and no delay or omission by the Administrative
Agent or any of the Banks in exercising any right or
remedy hereunder or with respect to any indebtedness of
the Borrower to any of the Banks shall operate as a
waiver thereof or of any other right or remedy, and no
single or partial exercise thereof shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right or remedy.  All rights and remedies of
the Administrative Agent and the Banks hereunder are
cumulative.

          10.3  Participations and Assignments.  The
Borrower shall not assign or otherwise transfer any of
the rights of the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement
without the prior written consent of all the Banks, and
any such assignment or other transfer without such
prior written consent shall be void.  No consent by any
Bank to any such assignment or other transfer shall
release the Borrower from any indebtedness, liability
or obligation of the Borrower pursuant to this
<PAGE>
Agreement.  No Bank shall assign or otherwise transfer,
or grant any participation in, any indebtedness,
liability or obligation of the Borrower to such Bank
pursuant to this Agreement or any of the rights and
remedies of such Bank pursuant to this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except
(i0 any Bank may assign or otherwise transfer, or grant
participations in, any indebtedness, liability or
obligation of the Borrower to any other Bank or to any
Affiliate of such Bank, and (ii) any Bank may execute
an assignment in favor of a Replacement Bank as
contemplated by Section 2.15 hereof.

          10.4  Successors and Assigns.  The Borrower,
Company, Subsidiary, Administrative Agent, Chase and

                     Environmental Matters



     Gibraltar Steel Corporation of New York has been
identified as a potentially responsible person (PRP) at
3 sites designated as Superfund Sites by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency:

     1.   Brant New York Site:  Several years ago,
Gibraltar delivered waste oil for disposal to Booth Oil
Company in Brant.  Booth Oil sold certain waste oil to
the Wide Beach Homeowners Association for use on dirt
parking lots.  Allegedly, some of the oil sold by Booth
contained PCBs, and the EPA undertook a clean up
operation.  On September 13, 1989, following the clean
up, Gibraltar was served with a demand letter by the
EPA seeking reimbursement of a portion of the
$2,262,000.00 spent on clean up costs.  On October 16,
1989, the EPA sued a number of parties in Federal Court
to recover its response costs.  Gibraltar was not named
as a defendant.  Certain parties settled with the EPA
in January, 1993.  To date, no action has been taken by
the EPA or any defendant to name Gibraltar as a party
to the litigation.

     2.   Notice of Violation from the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation and fine of
$5,000 dated August 8, 1997.

          FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned,
GIBRALTAR STEEL CORPORATION OF NEW YORK ("Borrower"),
hereby unconditionally promises to pay on the

or (b) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all

          Each entry on the Schedule attached hereto
(and any continuation thereof) shall be prima facie

          No failure by the Bank to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right or power hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise by the Administrative Agent or the
Bank of any right or power hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the
Bank, or of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of
the Bank, as herein specified are cumulative and not
exclusive of any other rights or remedies, including
those set forth in the Credit Agreement and the
Guaranties.

          Upon the happening of one or more Events of
Default as described in Section 7.1 of the Credit
Agreement, this Revolving Note may be accelerated in
accordance with Section 7.2 of the Credit Agreement.

          The Borrower hereby waives diligence,
presentment, protest and demand, and also notice of
protest, demand, dishonor and nonpayment of this
Revolving Note.

          This Revolving Note is one of the Revolving
Note referred to in the Credit Agreement, to which
reference is hereby made with respect to prepayment and
rights of acceleration of the principal hereof on the
occurrence of certain events.

          This Revolving Note shall be construed under,
and governed by, the laws of the State of New York,
without regard to its conflict of laws rules which

subsections (e) and (f) to Section 10.1 of the Credit
Agreement:

               "(e) which would release any material

the following conditions:

          1.   The Borrower shall have executed and
delivered to PNC Bank, N.A. a Revolving Note in the
maximum principal amount of $20,000,000.

          2.   Brazing Concepts Company shall have
executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent, for
the benefit of the Banks, an unlimited continuing

          4.   This Agreement shall be construed under,

number of counterparts, each of which when so executed
and delivered shall be an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
Agreement.
