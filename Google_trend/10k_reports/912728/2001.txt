ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Introduction

         Forward Air Corporation, through its operating subsidiaries (the
"Company" or "Forward Air"), offers its customers scheduled ground
transportation of cargo as a cost effective, reliable alternative to air
transportation. The Company transports cargo that must be delivered at a
specific time but is less time-sensitive than traditional air freight. This type
of cargo is frequently referred to in the transportation industry as "deferred
air freight." Forward Air operates a network of 75 terminals located on or near
airports in the United States and Canada, including a central sorting facility
in Columbus, Ohio and regional hubs serving key markets. Rather than owning its
own trucks, the Company purchases most of its transportation requirements from
owner-operators and, to a lesser extent, from truckload carriers. A typical
shipment consists of a pallet load of freight, often computers,
telecommunications equipment, machine parts, trade show exhibit materials or
medical equipment. During 2000, an average shipment weighed over 700 pounds.
Forward Air has experienced rapid revenue growth from $63.6 million in 1995 to
$214.9 million in 2000, a 28% compound annual growth rate. The Company's
operating income grew from $6.4 million to $37.3 million over the same period, a
42% compound annual growth rate.

         The Company focuses its services on: air freight forwarders, which are
businesses that arrange transportation of cargo for third parties; integrated
air cargo carriers; and airlines. The Company serves its customers by locating
terminals on or near airports and maintaining regularly scheduled transportation
service between major cities. Forward Air receives shipments at its terminals
and transports them by truck to its central sorting facility or one of its
regional hubs, where they are unloaded and sorted. After sorting, the shipments
are reloaded and delivered to the terminals nearest their destinations. The
Company ships freight directly between terminals when justified by the volume of
shipments. The Company typically does not provide local pickup and delivery
services and does not market its services directly to shippers. Since the
Company does not place significant size or weight restrictions on shipments, it
does not compete directly with small or overnight package delivery services such
as DHL Worldwide, UPS and Airborne. Approximately 20% of the shipments the
Company handles are for overnight delivery, with the rest for delivery within
two to four days.

Industry Overview

         As businesses minimize inventory levels, perform manufacturing and
assembly operations in multiple locations and distribute their products through
many channels, they more frequently require expedited delivery services.
Expedited shipments are those shipments that the customer requires to be
delivered the next day or within two to three days, usually at a specified time
or within a specified time window.


                                        3
<PAGE>   4

         Shippers with expedited delivery requirements have four principal
alternatives to transport freight: they may use a fully integrated air cargo
carrier, an airline, a less-than-truckload carrier or an air freight forwarder.
Integrated air cargo carriers provide pick-up and delivery services primarily
using their own fleet of trucks and provide transportation services generally
using their own fleet of aircraft. Airlines provide airport to airport service,
but have limited cargo space and generally accept only shipments weighing less
than 150 pounds. Less-than-truckload carriers provide pick-up and delivery
services through their own fleet of trucks. The national less-than- truckload
carriers operate terminals where freight is unloaded, sorted and reloaded
multiple times in a single shipment. The additional handling increases transit
time, handling costs and the likelihood of cargo damage. An air freight
forwarder obtains shipments from customers, makes arrangements for
transportation of the cargo by a third party carrier and usually arranges for
both delivery from the shipper to the carrier and from the carrier to the
recipient.

         Although expedited freight is primarily transported by aircraft,
transportation by truck often is a viable alternative, especially for shipments
requiring deferred delivery. Generally, the cost of shipping freight, especially
heavy freight, by truck is substantially less than shipping by aircraft. The
Company believes there are several trends that are increasing demand for
lower-cost truck transportation of expedited freight. These trends include:

    Increased Outsourcing of Logistics Management to Third Parties. Air freight
    forwarders are playing an increasingly important role in logistics
    management. As the growing emphasis on just-in-time processes has added to
    the complexity of logistics management, companies are finding it more
    advantageous to outsource their logistics management functions to third
    parties. In contrast to integrated air cargo carriers and
    less-than-truckload carriers that are focused on utilizing their own
    fixed-cost assets, air freight forwarders can select from various
    transportation modes and suppliers to meet their customers' shipping
    requirements, thereby serving their customers less expensively. Air freight
    forwarders generally handle shipments of any size and offer customized
    shipping options, unlike integrated air cargo carriers and less-
    than-truckload carriers.

    Integrated Air Cargo Carriers' Increased Focus on Expedited Freight.
    Integrated air cargo carriers that transport heavy freight, such as Emery
    Worldwide and BAX Global, are increasingly targeting their marketing efforts
    at higher yielding expedited or overnight freight to better utilize their
    high fixed-cost infrastructures. As a result, these carriers are
    increasingly outsourcing deferred freight to surface transportation
    providers like Forward Air.

    Reduced Airline Cargo Capacity. Since the 1980's, when the airlines
    eliminated many of their all-cargo aircraft, growth in demand for air cargo
    services has generally outpaced the growth of aircraft cargo capacity. More
    recently, airlines have been modifying their domestic route systems to
    provide higher frequency service to more destinations, therefore replacing
    many of their wide-body aircraft with narrow-body aircraft that have less
    cargo capacity. Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") mandates have also
    reduced air cargo capacity because most all-cargo aircraft are older, and it
    often is not economically feasible to modify these older aircraft to meet
    the FAA's noise reduction standards.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

         The Company believes that its competitive advantages are:

         -        Focus on the deferred air freight market. Forward Air focuses
                  on providing ground transportation services to the deferred
                  air freight market. The Company believes that this focus and
                  commitment to reliable service has enabled Forward Air to
                  provide a higher level of service in a more cost effective
                  manner than its competitors.

         -        Concentrated marketing strategy. The Company provides its
                  services to air freight forwarders, integrated air cargo
                  carriers and airlines rather than marketing its services
                  directly to shippers. The Company does not place significant
                  size or weight restrictions on shipments and, therefore, does
                  not compete with small or overnight package delivery services
                  such as DHL Worldwide, UPS and Airborne. The Company believes
                  that air freight forwarders prefer to purchase their
                  transportation services from Forward Air because it does not
                  market its services to their shipper customers and is not
                  competing with them for customers.

         -        Established nationwide network of terminals and sorting
                  facilities. The Company has built a network throughout the
                  United States and Canada located on or near airports. The
                  Company believes it would be difficult for a competitor to
                  duplicate its nationwide network without the expertise it has
                  acquired and without expending significant management
                  resources and capital. Forward Air's network enables it to
                  provide regularly scheduled service between most markets,
                  on-time delivery with minimal freight damage or loss, all at
                  rates significantly below air freight rates.

         -        Low-capital-intensive business model. The Company purchases
                  virtually all of its transportation requirements from
                  owner-operators or truckload carriers, rather than acquiring
                  and operating its own tractors. This allows the Company to
                  respond quickly to changing demands and opportunities in its
                  industry and to generate a higher return on assets with lower
                  capital expenditures.

         -        Enhanced technology. The Company is committed to using
                  information technology to improve its service and reduce its
                  operating costs. Technology allows the Company to increase the
                  volume of freight that it can handle in its network and
                  provides real-time tracking and tracing of shipments
                  throughout the transportation process. Forward Air is
                  currently enhancing its systems to permit its customers to
                  obtain real-time information about that shipment via the
                  Internet.

         -        Broad customer base. The Company has established close
                  relationships with a large number of air freight forwarders,
                  integrated air cargo carriers and airlines. The Company's five
                  largest customers only accounted for approximately 18.0% of
                  its operating revenue in 2000, and no single customer
                  accounted for more than ten percent.

GROWTH STRATEGY

         The key elements of Forward Air's growth strategy are to:

         -        Increase freight volume from existing customers. Many of the
                  Company's customers currently use Forward Air for only a
                  portion of their overall transportation needs. In addition,
                  many of the Company's air freight forwarder customers are
                  growing rapidly, and the Company expects that they will have a
                  greater need for its services as their businesses grow. The
                  Company will continue to market directly to these customers to
                  capture additional freight volume.

         -        Improve efficiency of its transportation network. The Company
                  constantly seeks to improve the efficiency of its network
                  without changing its infrastructure or incurring significant
                  capital expenditures. As the volume of freight between key
                  markets increases, the Company intends to continue to add
                  regional hubs and direct shuttles. Additional regional hubs
                  and direct shuttles improve Forward Air's efficiency by
                  reducing the number of miles freight must be transported and
                  reducing the number of times freight must be handled and
                  sorted. Increased freight volumes should increase the
                  Company's profits and operating margins because these
                  additional shipments help cover the substantial fixed costs of
                  its operations.

         -        Develop new customers. The Company will actively market its
                  services to potential new air freight forwarder customers. The
                  Company believes air freight forwarders will move away from
                  integrated air cargo carriers because of those carriers'
                  higher costs and away from less-than-truckload carriers
                  because of those carriers' less reliable service. The Company
                  also believes that there is significant potential for
                  increased freight volume from airlines as well as from the
                  integrated air cargo carriers.

         -        Enhance information systems. The Company is committed to
                  continued enhancement of its information systems in ways that
                  can provide it both competitive service advantages and
                  increased productivity. Management believes that Forward Air's
                  customers will increasingly demand more sophisticated
                  information systems to track and trace shipments. Forward Air
                  believes its enhanced systems will enable it to retain
                  existing customers and encourage them to increase the volume
                  of freight they send through its network. The Company also
                  believes these enhanced information systems will attract new
                  customers.

         -        Expand logistics services. The Company will continue to expand
                  its national and international logistics services to increase
                  revenue and improve utilization of its terminal facilities and
                  labor force. The Company has added a number of services in the
                  past few years, such as exclusive-use transportation services,
                  and insurance, customs brokerage and terminal handling
                  services. These services directly benefit Forward Air's
                  customers, particularly air freight forwarders who cannot
                  justify providing the services for themselves, attract new
                  customers and improve utilization of the Forward Air network
                  by increasing its revenue without significantly increasing the
                  Company's costs.

         -        Pursue acquisitions. The Company intends to continue to
                  evaluate acquisitions that can increase its penetration of a
                  geographic area, add customers or freight density or allow it
                  to offer additional services. Since its inception, the Company
                  has acquired the assets of eight of its regional competitors
                  that met one or more of these criteria.

OPERATIONS

         The Company receives freight from air freight forwarders, airlines and
integrated air cargo carriers at its terminals, which are located on or near
airports in the United States and Canada. The Company consolidates and
transports these shipments by truck through the Forward Air network to the
terminals nearest the ultimate destinations of the shipments. The Company
operates regularly scheduled service to and from each of its terminals through
its Columbus, Ohio central sorting facility or through one of its regional hubs.
The Company also operates regularly scheduled shuttle service directly between
cities where the volume of freight warrants bypassing the Columbus sorting
facility or a regional hub. When a shipment arrives at the terminal nearest its
destination, the customer arranges for the shipment to be picked up at the
terminal and delivered to its final destination.

         A typical shipment consists of a pallet load of freight, often
computers, telecommunications equipment, machine parts, trade show exhibit
materials or medical equipment. Since Forward Air commenced operations in
November 1990, the weekly volume of freight moving through its network has
increased from an average of approximately 1.2 million pounds to over 24.0
million pounds in 2000. During 2000, an average shipment weighed over 700
pounds. Shipments range from small boxes weighing only a few pounds to large
shipments of several thousand pounds. Although the Company imposes no
significant size or weight restrictions, it focuses its marketing and price
structure on shipments of 200 pounds or more. As a result, the Company does not
directly compete for most of its business with overnight couriers or small
package delivery companies.

         Independent agents operate twelve of these locations, which typically
handle relatively low volumes of freight.

SHUTTLE SERVICE AND REGIONAL HUBS

         The Company operates direct terminal-to-terminal shuttles and regional
overnight service between cities where justified by freight volumes. The Company
currently provides regional overnight service to many of the markets within its
network. Direct service allows the Company to provide quicker scheduled service
at a lower cost because it can transport freight over the most direct route and
eliminate the added time and cost of handling the freight at its central or a
regional hub sorting facility. Direct shipments also reduce the likelihood of
damage because of reduced handling and sorting of the freight. As Forward Air
continues to increase volume between various cities, it intends to continue to
add direct shuttles. For example, the Northeast Shuttle transports freight
between Albany, Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Hartford, Newark, Newburgh, New
York, Philadelphia, Rochester, Syracuse and Washington. The Company accomplishes
this by direct shipment, as from Boston to Newark, or by overnight service
routed through the Newburgh regional hub. Where warranted by sufficient volume
in a region, the Company utilizes larger terminals as regional sorting hubs,
which allows it to bypass the Columbus sorting facility. These regional hubs
improve the Company's operating efficiency and enhance customer service. The
Company currently operates regional hubs in Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Kansas
City, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Newburgh, Orlando and San Francisco.

SHIPMENTS

         Since operations were commenced in November 1990, the weekly volume of
freight moving through the Company's network has increased from an average of
approximately 1.2 million pounds to over 24.0 million pounds per week as shown
below:

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETING

         The Company's customers are air freight forwarders, airlines and
integrated air cargo carriers. Air freight forwarder customers vary in size from
small, independent, single facility companies to large, international logistics
companies, such as USF Worldwide, Associated Global Systems, Pilot Air Freight,
AIT Freight Systems and Eagle Global Logistics. Airline customers include Virgin
Atlantic, Delta, Northwest Airlines, Continental, United Airlines, British
Airways, Air Nippon, Air France, Korean Airlines, KLM and Japan Airlines.
Because of Forward Air's reputation for dependable service, integrated air cargo
carriers such as Emery Worldwide, Airborne, BAX Global and UPS utilize its
services to provide overflow capacity and other services.

         The Company markets its services through a sales and marketing staff
located in various regions of the United States. Senior management also is
actively involved in sales and marketing at the national account level and
supports local sales activity. The Company has a strong commitment to marketing
and focuses on air freight forwarders, airlines and integrated air cargo
carriers that have time sensitive shipping requirements requiring customized
services. The Company also participates in air cargo trade shows and advertises
its services through direct mail programs and through the Internet via
www.forwardair.com.

LOGISTICS SERVICES

         Customers increasingly demand more than the movement of freight from
their transportation providers. To meet these demands, the Company continually
seeks ways to customize its logistics services and add new services. Logistics
services increase the Company's profit margins by increasing its revenue without
corresponding increases in its fixed costs.

         Forward Air logistics services include providing:

         -        exclusive-use transportation services;

         -        dock, warehouse and office space;

         -        customs brokerage, such as assistance with customs procedures
                  for both import and export shipments; and

         -        terminal handling, such as shipment build-up and break-down
                  and reconsolidation of air or ocean pallets or containers.

TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS

         The regular enhancement of the Company's information systems is a key
component of its growth strategy. The Company has invested and will continue to
invest significant management and financial resources on improving its
information systems in an effort to provide accurate, real-


                                       10
<PAGE>   11

time information to its management and customers. Management believes the
ability to provide accurate, real-time information on the status of shipments
will become increasingly important and that its efforts in this area will result
in both competitive service advantages and increased productivity throughout the
Forward Air network.

PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION

         The Company contracts for most of its transportation services from
owner-operators. The owner-operators own, operate and maintain their own
vehicles and employ their own drivers. The Company also purchases transportation
from Landair Corporation and from other truckload carriers to handle overflow
volume. Of the $91.4 million of purchased transportation in 2000, the Company
purchased 70.9% from owner-operators, 2.4% from Landair Corporation and 26.7%
from other common carriers.

         The Company seeks to establish long-term relationships with
owner-operators to assure dependable service and availability, and the Company
has consistently experienced a low turnover of owner-operators. The Company has
established guidelines relating to safety records, driving experience and
personal evaluations that it uses to select its owner-operators. To enhance the
Company's relationship with the owner-operators, it pays per mile rates above
prevailing market rates and offers each driver a consistent work schedule,
typically to the same destination.

COMPETITION

         The air freight transportation industry is highly competitive and very
fragmented. The Company's competitors include regional trucking companies that
specialize in handling deferred air freight and regional and national
less-than-truckload carriers. To a lesser extent, the Company competes with
integrated air cargo carriers and airlines. The Company's competition ranges
from small operators that compete within a limited geographic area to companies
with substantially greater financial and other resources and larger freight
capacity. The Company also faces competition from its air freight forwarder
customers who decide to establish their own networks to transport deferred air
freight. The Company believes competition is based on service, primarily on-time
delivery and reliability, as well as rates. The Company believes it offers its
services at rates that are substantially below the charge to transport the same
shipment to the same destination by air. The Company believes it has an
advantage over less-than-truckload carriers based upon its reputation for
faster, more reliable service between many cities.

EMPLOYEES

         As of December 31, 2000, the Company employed 1,820 persons, 930 of
whom were freight handlers and customer service personnel. None of the Company's
employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company
recognizes that its workforce, including its freight handlers, is one of its
most valuable assets. The recruitment, training and retention of qualified
employees are essential to support the Company's continued growth and to meet
the service requirements of its customers.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND LITIGATION

         Under Department of Transportation regulations, the Company may be
liable for property damage or personal injuries caused by owner-operators while
they are transporting freight on its behalf. The Company is self-insured for
property damage to its own equipment. The Company believes that its insurance
coverage is sufficient to adequately protect it from significant claims.

         From time to time, the Company is a party to litigation arising in the
normal course of its business, most of which involve claims for personal injury,
property damage related to the transportation and handling of freight or
workers' compensation. The Company does not believe that any of these pending
actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect
on its business, financial condition or results of operations.

REGULATION

         The Company, through its Forward Air, Inc. subsidiary, is a licensed
property broker holding authority issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration ("FMCSA") at Docket No. MC-249708. The Company, through its FAF,
Inc. subsidiary, is an interstate motor carrier licensed by the FMCSA at Docket
No. MC-333604. The Company's air freight business is subject to regulation as an
indirect air cargo carrier under the Federal Aviation Act, although freight
brokers have been exempted from most of the requirements of the Federal Aviation
Act by the Economic Aviation Regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition,
the Company's domestic customs brokerage operations are subject to the licensing
requirements of the United States Department of the Treasury and are regulated
by the United States Customs Service. The Federal Maritime Commission regulates
the Company's ocean freight forwarding operations.

         The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements relating to its operations. If the Company
does not comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could be required to
pay substantial fines and could have its licenses revoked.

         The Company is also subject to federal and state environmental laws and
regulations, including those dealing with the transportation of hazardous
materials and storage of fuel. The Company believes that it is in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company does
not expect any material expenditures for compliance with federal, state or local
environmental laws and regulations in 2001.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

         The Company's headquarters are located in Greeneville, Tennessee. The
Company leases this building from the Greeneville-Greene County Airport
Authority. The Company's central sorting facility in Columbus, Ohio was
constructed in 1994. During the third quarter of 2000, the Company entered into
a ten-year lease with the Rickenbacker Port Authority for a 50,000 square foot
building on the Rickenbacker Airport in Columbus near the hub. The Company owns
a terminal facility in Atlanta.

         The Company leases 61 additional terminal facilities for terms
typically ranging from three to five years. The Company shares its Indianapolis
terminal with Landair Corporation. The Company believes that, in most of the
markets it serves, replacement space comparable to these terminal facilities is
obtainable. The Company believes that its facilities are adequate to support its
current operations. The remaining twelve terminals are agent stations operated
by independent agents who handle freight for the Company on a commission basis.

         The Company owns or leases the trailers it uses to move freight through
the Forward Air network. Substantially all of the Company's trailers are 53'
long, and many have specialized roller bed equipment required to serve air cargo
industry customers. The average age of the Company's owned trailer fleet was
approximately 2.9 years at December 31, 2000.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         From time to time, the Company is a party to litigation arising in the
normal course of its business, most of which involve claims for personal injury
and property damage related to the transportation and handling of freight or
workers' compensation. The Company does not believe that any of these pending
actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect
on its business, financial condition or results of operations.


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000,
no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders through the solicitation
of proxies or otherwise.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

         The Company provides scheduled ground transportation of cargo on a
time-definite basis. As a result of the Company's established transportation
schedule and network of terminals, its operating cost structure includes
significant fixed costs. The Company's ability to improve its operating margins
will depend on its ability to increase the volume of freight moved through its
network.

         The following does not include a discussion and analysis of the
truckload carrier business, which has been accounted for as a discontinued
operation as a result of the Spin-off.

Results of Operations

         The following table sets forth the percentage relationship of expense
items to operating revenue for the periods indicated.

</TABLE>

Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999

        Operating revenue increased by $44.1 million, or 25.8%, to $214.9
million for 2000 from $170.8 million in 1999. This increase resulted primarily
from increased volume from domestic and international air cargo customers, an
increased number of operating terminals and direct shuttles, and enhanced
logistics services.


                                       18
<PAGE>   19


        Purchased transportation was 42.5% of operating revenue in 2000 compared
to 43.8% in 1999. The decrease in purchased transportation was primarily
attributable to operating efficiencies resulting from increased volumes of
freight transported through the Forward Air network.

        Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 22.0% of operating revenue in
2000 compared to 22.4% in 1999. The decrease in salaries, wages and employee
benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was due primarily to operating
efficiencies resulting from increased volumes of freight transported through the
Forward Air network.

        Operating leases, the largest component of which is terminal rent, were
4.7% of operating revenue in 2000 compared to 5.2% in 1999. This decrease in
operating leases as a percentage of revenue was attributable to increased
leverage resulting from increased operating revenue.

        Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating
revenue was 2.7% in 2000, compared to 2.9% in 1999. The decrease in depreciation
and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue was attributable to
increased utilization of operating equipment during 2000 as a result of
increased operating revenue.

        Insurance and claims as a percentage of revenue was 1.7% of operating
revenue in 2000, compared with 1.2% in 1999. This increase in insurance and
claims expense as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in
the frequency and severity of accidents and higher premium costs during 2000.

        Other operating expenses were 9.0% of operating revenue in 2000 and
1999.

        Income from operations increased by $10.9 million, or 41.3%, to $37.3
million for 2000 compared to $26.4 million for 1999. This increase in income
from operations is due primarily to a lower operating cost structure resulting
from an increase in operating revenue, which allowed the Company to spread the
fixed costs of its network over a larger revenue base. The increase in income
from operations during 2000 was partially offset by operating losses of
approximately $1.6 million relating to the Company's information technology
subsidiary, LogTech Corporation. In 2001, the Company plans to wind-down the
LogTech operations and begin offering its information technology services to its
existing customer base. The wind-down of LogTech operations will result in an
additional estimated $350,000, or $.01 per share, of operating losses during the
first quarter of 2001.

        Interest expense was $107,000 in 2000 compared to $787,000, or 0.5% of
revenue, in 1999. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower average net
borrowings during 2000 coupled with the capitalization of interest costs
totaling $301,000 during 2000 relating to the development of internal-use
software.

        The combined federal and state effective tax rate for 2000 was 38.2%,
compared to a rate of 38.3% for 1999. For information concerning income taxes,
as well as information regarding differences between effective tax rates and
statutory rates, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


                                       19
<PAGE>   20

         As a result of the foregoing factors, income from continuing operations
increased by $7.4 million, or 46.3%, to $23.4 million for 2000, from $16.0
million in 1999.

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998

         Operating revenue increased by $40.4 million, or 31.0%, to $170.8
million for 1999 from $130.4 million in 1998. This increase resulted primarily
from increased volume from domestic and international air cargo customers, an
increased number of operating terminals and direct shuttles, and enhanced
logistics services.

         Purchased transportation was 43.8% of operating revenue in 1999
compared to 43.2% in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to an
increase in revenue from exclusive use transportation services which have a
higher purchased transportation percentage than freight transported through the
Forward Air network. The increase in purchased transportation was partially
offset by operating efficiencies resulting from increased volumes of freight
transported through the Forward Air network.

         Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 22.4% of operating revenue
in 1999 compared to 23.9% in 1998. The decrease in salaries, wages and employee
benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was due primarily to operating
efficiencies resulting from increased volumes of freight transported through the
Forward Air network coupled with a reduction in the number of Company drivers
which were hired initially as a part of the acquisition of certain of the assets
of Adams Air Cargo, Inc. in October 1997.

         Operating leases, the largest component of which is terminal rent, were
5.2% of operating revenue in 1999 compared to 5.3% in 1998. This decrease was
attributable to increased leverage resulting from increased operating revenue.

         Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating
revenue was 2.9% in 1999, compared to 3.3% in 1998. The decrease in depreciation
and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue was attributable to
increased utilization of operating equipment during 1999 as a result of
increased operating revenue.

         Insurance and claims as a percentage of revenue was 1.2% of operating
revenue in 1999, compared with 1.8% in 1998. This decrease was due primarily to
a decrease in the frequency and severity of accidents and lower premium costs
during 1999.

         Other operating expenses were 9.0% of operating revenue in 1999
compared to 10.2% in 1998. The decrease in other operating expenses as a
percentage of operating revenue was primarily attributable to a lower operating
cost structure due to increased operating revenue and a reduction in commissions
paid to agent terminals.

         Income from operations increased by $10.4 million, or 65.0%, to $26.4
million for 1999 compared to $16.0 million for 1998. This increase in income
from operations is due primarily


                                       20
<PAGE>   21

to a lower operating cost structure resulting from an increase in operating
revenue, which allowed the Company to spread the fixed costs of its network over
a larger revenue base.

         Interest expense was $787,000, or 0.5%, of operating revenue in 1999,
compared to $1.2 million, or 0.9%, in 1998. The decrease in interest expense was
due to lower average net borrowing during 1999 coupled with the capitalization
of interest costs totaling $71,000 during 1999 relating to the development of
internal-use software.

         The combined federal and state effective tax rate for 1999 was 38.3%,
compared to a rate of 38.1% for 1998. For information concerning income taxes,
as well as information regarding differences between effective tax rates and
statutory rates, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

         As a result of the foregoing factors, income from continuing operations
increased by $6.8 million, or 73.9%, to $16.0 million for 1999, from $9.2
million in 1998.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         Prior to the Spin-off in September 1998, the Company operated its
business and the truckload carrier business of Landair Corporation. As a result,
the Company's statement of cash flows for 1998 does not reflect the cash flows
of its business on a stand-alone basis.

         The Company has historically financed its working capital needs,
including capital purchases, with cash flows from operations and borrowings
under its bank lines of credit. Net cash provided by operating activities
totaled approximately $33.8 million for 2000, $20.1 million for 1999 and $1.9
million for 1998. The increases in net cash provided by operating activities in
2000 and 1999 are mainly attributable to growth and improvements in results of
operations.

         Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $26.9 million
in 2000, $13.4 million in 1999 and $17.0 million in 1998. Investing activities
consisted primarily of acquisitions in 2000 and 1999 and the $5.0 million
capital contribution to Landair Corporation in 1998, along with the purchase of
operating equipment and management information systems during all three years.

         Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.6 million and $14.6
million in 2000 and 1998, respectively, compared to cash used in financing
activities of $1.2 million in 1999. Financing activities included the continued
financing of operating equipment and working capital needs, repayment of
long-term debt and capital leases, proceeds received from the exercise of stock
options, Common Stock issued under the Company's employee stock purchase plan,
and Common Stock issued from a public offering.

         On May 4, 1999, 1.5 million shares of the Common Stock of the Company
were sold under a Form S-3 Registration Statement dated April 23, 1999. The net
proceeds of the offering were $18.0 million and were used principally to repay
outstanding debt.


                                       21
<PAGE>   22

         The Company expects net capital expenditures in 2001 for operating
equipment and management information systems, excluding acquisitions, to be less
than $5 million. The Company expects to fund these expenditures through cash
provided by operating activities and borrowings under its credit facility.

         The credit facility consists of a working capital line of credit. As
long as the Company complies with several financial covenants and ratios, the
credit facility permits it to borrow up to $20.0 million. Interest rates for
advances under the facilities vary based on covenants related to total
indebtedness, cash flows, results of operations and other ratios. The facility
bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.00% to 1.90%, expires in April 2002 and is
secured by accounts receivable. The amount the Company can borrow under the line
of credit is reduced by the amount of any outstanding letters of credit.

         Management believes that the Company's available cash, expected cash
generated from future operations and borrowings under available lines of credit,
will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash needs for at least the next
twelve months.

         On February 24, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one
stock split which was distributed on March 19, 1999. On January 10, 2000, the
Board of Directors approved a three-for-two stock split which was distributed on
January 28, 2000. All share, earnings per share, dividends per share, and
quarterly stock price data included herein and in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and Notes thereto have been restated to give effect to the stock
splits.

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

         In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133, as amended, is required to be adopted by
the Company in 2001. Management does not anticipate that the adoption of the
Statement will have a significant effect on the financial position or results of
operations of the Company.

         The Company, or its officers and directors on behalf of the Company,
may from time to time make written or oral "forward-looking statements." Written
forward-looking statements may appear in documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), in press releases and in reports to
shareholders. Oral forward-looking statements may be made by the Company's
officers and directors on behalf of the Company to the press, potential
investors, securities analysts and others. The Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 contains a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. The
Company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures. In connection
with this safe harbor provision, the Company is hereby identifying important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of the Company.
Without limitation, factors that might cause such a difference include economic
factors such as recessions, inflation, higher interest rates and downturns in
customer business cycles, the Company's inability


                                       22

to maintain its historical growth rate due to a decreased volume of freight
moving through the Company's network, competition, surplus inventories, loss of
a major customer, the ability of the Company's information systems to handle
increased volume of freight moving through its network, and the availability and
compensation of qualified independent owner-operators to serve the Company's
transportation needs. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update
these forward-looking statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

         On May 4, 1999, the Company sold 1.5 million shares of Common Stock in
a public offering. The net proceeds of $18.0 million were used principally to
repay outstanding debt. With this repayment, the Company's exposure to market
risk related to its remaining outstanding debt is not significant.

                         Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Forward Air Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Forward Air
Corporation as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2000. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Forward Air
Corporation at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include
Forward Air Corporation and its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

On July 9, 1998 (the "Measurement Date"), the Board of Directors of the Company
authorized the separation of the Company into two publicly-held corporations,
one owning and operating the deferred air freight operations and the other
owning and operating the truckload operations (the "Spin-off").

The Spin-off was effected on September 23, 1998 through the distribution to
shareholders of the Company of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
a new truckload holding company (formerly "the Truckload Business"), Landair
Corporation. Pursuant to the Spin-off, the common stock of Landair Corporation
was distributed on a pro rata basis of one share of Landair Corporation common
stock for every one share of the Company's common stock held as of the record
date. Subsequent to the Spin-off, the Company has continued as the legal entity
that owns and operates the deferred air freight operations through its operating
subsidiaries and Landair Corporation is the legal entity that owns and operates
the truckload operations. As a result of the Spin-off, the results of operations
and cash flows of the Truckload Business have been reported as discontinued
operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements (see Note 2).

As used in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the term "Forward
Air Business" refers to the deferred air freight operations; Landair
Corporation, or the term "Truckload Business," refers to the truckload
operations; and the "Company" refers to the entity which, prior to the Spin-off,
through its subsidiaries operated both the Forward Air Business and the
Truckload Business and which, after the Spin-off, continues to operate the
Forward Air Business.

The Company operates a comprehensive national network for the time-definite
surface transportation of deferred freight. The Company provides its
transportation services through a network of terminals located on or near
airports in the United States and Canada. The Company's customers consist
primarily of air freight forwarders, domestic and international airlines and
integrated air cargo carriers. The Company's operations involve receiving
deferred freight shipments at its terminals and transporting them by truck to
the terminal nearest their destination.

1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

OPERATING REVENUE

Operating revenue and related costs are recognized as of the date shipments are
completed. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of operating revenue
from continuing operations in 2000, 1999 or 1998.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

INVENTORIES

Inventories of tires, replacement parts, supplies, and fuel for equipment are
stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the FIFO (first-in, first-out)
method of determining cost.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and
equipment is calculated based upon the cost of the asset, reduced by its
estimated salvage value, using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives as follows:

The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including goodwill and other
intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate

impairment is based upon determining whether

projected undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset over its
remaining useful life are less than the carrying value of the asset. As of
December 31, 2000, in the opinion of management, there has been no such
impairment.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company is self-insured for certain of its workers' compensation, property
damage, auto liability and medical benefit claims. The Company has entered into
agreements with independent insurance companies to limit its losses with respect
to these claims.

INCOME PER SHARE

The Company calculates income per share in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Under SFAS
No. 128, basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options,
warrants and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share includes any
dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities, and uses the
treasury stock method in calculating dilution. All earnings per share data
included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been
restated to give effect to a three-for-two stock split and a two-for-one stock
split (see Note 5).

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

The Company had no items of other comprehensive income in 2000, 1999 and 1998
and, accordingly, comprehensive income is equivalent to net income.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

The Company grants options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an
exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the grant date. The
Company accounts for employee stock option grants in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and,
accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense for the stock option grants.

COMMON EXPENSES

Prior to the Spin-off, certain administrative and back office functions were
shared by both the Forward Air Business and the Truckload Business. The expenses
related to these services were allocated to the Forward Air Business and the
Truckload Business in accordance with the provisions of a Transition Services
Agreement as discussed in Note 2. These administrative

1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

expenses, which would have been incurred by the Forward Air Business and the
Truckload Business if each had been operated as an independent stand-alone
entity, totaled $2.8 million for the Forward Air Business and $3.2 million for
the Truckload Business for the period January 1, 1998 through September 23,
1998.

Interest expense of $661,000 for the Forward Air Business and $1.4 million for
the Truckload Business for the period from January 1, 1998 through September 23,
1998 has been allocated by the Company on an annual basis based upon the pro
rata share of average operating assets of the Truckload Business and the Forward
Air Business.

Management believes these allocation methods are reasonable.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 1998, SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, was issued and was required to be adopted in years beginning after
June 15, 1999. In June 1999, SFAS No. 137 was issued, deferring the effective
date of SFAS No. 133 for one year. This Statement requires all derivatives to be
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. This results in the offsetting
changes in fair values or cash flows of both the hedge and the hedged item being
recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income, as appropriate, in the
same period. Changes in fair value of derivatives not meeting the Statement's
hedge criteria are included in income. The Company adopted the new Statement as
of January 1, 2001. The Company does not expect the adoption of this Statement
to have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements
to conform to the 2000 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on
net income as previously reported.

2.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

As discussed in Note 1, on July 9, 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company
authorized the separation of the Company into two publicly-held corporations,
one owning and operating the Forward Air Business and the other owning and
operating the Truckload Business. The Spin-off was effected on September 23,
1998.

(1)      The fiscal 1998 summarized income statement information above includes
         the results of operations only through the July 9, 1998 Measurement
         Date.

The loss on Spin-off in the amount of $380,000 recorded in 1998 includes the
net of the after-tax income of the discontinued operations from the Measurement
Date through the date of the Spin-off of $730,000 ($1.2 million on a pre-tax
basis), and costs associated with the Spin-off of $1.1 million. The costs
associated with the Spin-off represent the cost of separating the two
businesses which are non-deductible for income tax purposes.

In connection with the Spin-off, the Company and Landair Corporation entered
into certain agreements which were effective upon the actual separation of the
two companies. The agreements were entered into to facilitate orderly changes
from an integrated transportation company to separate deferred air freight and
truckload operating companies in a way which is minimally disruptive to each
entity. Following are summaries of the principal agreements:

DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

The Distribution Agreement provided for, among other things, the principal
corporate transactions required to effect the Spin-off and the allocation of
certain assets and liabilities between the Company and Landair Corporation. The
Distribution Agreement provides that the Company and Landair Corporation each
have sole responsibility for claims arising out of their respective activities
after the Spin-off. It also provides that each party will indemnify the other
in the event of certain liabilities arising under the federal securities laws,
and that, for a period of three years after the Spin-off, neither the Company
nor Landair Corporation will directly solicit the employment of any employee of
the other company or its affiliates without the prior written consent of such
other company.

2.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

The Transition Services Agreement describes the services which the Company and
Landair Corporation provide to each other following the Spin-off. Services
performed under the Transition Services Agreement are negotiated and paid for
on an arm's-length basis. The Company or Landair Corporation, as recipients of
the services, may terminate any or all such services at any time on thirty
days' irrevocable written notice, and the Company or Landair Corporation, as
providers of the services, may terminate any or all of the services, other than
information technology services, on three months' irrevocable notice.
Information technology services to be provided by the Company to Landair
Corporation have a thirty-six month term.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS AGREEMENT

The Employee Benefit Matters Agreement provided for the treatment of employee
benefit matters and other compensation arrangements for the employees of the
Company and Landair Corporation after the Spin-off. Pursuant to this agreement,
the Company continued sponsorship of the various employee benefit plans and
welfare plans of the Company with respect to employees of the Company after the
Spin-off, and Landair Corporation established such similar plans to provide to
its employees after the Spin-off substantially the same benefits previously
provided to them as employees of the Company. This Employee Benefit Matters
Agreement also provided for the adjustment and conversion of the existing
non-exercisable stock options of the Company into options of Landair
Corporation for those employees that continued employment with Landair
Corporation after the Spin-off. (See Note 5).

TAX SHARING AGREEMENT

The Tax Sharing Agreement describes the responsibilities of the Company and
Landair Corporation with respect to all tax matters occurring prior to and
after the Spin-off. The Tax Sharing Agreement provides for the allocation of
tax expense, assessments, refunds and other tax benefits. The Agreement also
sets forth the responsibility for filing tax returns and provides for
reasonable cooperation in the event of any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to any federal, state or local tax.

3.  ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES

In December 2000, the Company acquired the assets of Dedicated Transportation
Services, Inc. ("DTSI"), a deferred air freight contractor to the air cargo
industry based in Santa Ana, California. The Company paid approximately $10.7
million in cash for certain assets of DTSI (including approximately $700,000 of
capitalized direct and/or out-of-pocket expenses related to

the acquisition), which included accounts receivable, net of estimated costs to
collect such receivables, in the amount of approximately $5.4 million. As of
December 31, 2000, the Company has collected approximately $1.3 million in DTSI
accounts receivable and the remaining $4.1 million is included in accounts
receivable in the accompanying balance sheet. The acquisition was accounted for
as a purchase and the excess cost over fair value of the net assets acquired is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a fifteen-year period. The
allocation of the purchase price resulted in a tentative allocation of $5.1
million to goodwill. This allocation may change upon the completion of the
collection of DTSI accounts receivable. The Company also entered into
non-compete agreements with the former owners of DTSI, which provide for a
total of $500,000 to be paid annually by the Company over a three-year period.
Non-compete agreements are being amortized over the terms of the agreements.

In October 1999, the Company acquired certain air cargo operating assets of
Quick Delivery Service, Inc. ("Quick"), a deferred air freight contractor to
the air cargo industry based in Mobile, Alabama and certain air cargo operating
assets of LTD Air Cargo, Inc. ("LTD"), a deferred air freight contractor to the
air cargo industry based in Franklin, Tennessee. The Company paid approximately
$6.8 million in cash and issued notes payable totaling $1.0 million for the
above two acquisitions. The acquisitions were accounted for as purchases. The
Company also entered into non-compete agreements with the former owners of
Quick and LTD for a total of $400,000 to be paid in installments by the Company
over the terms of the agreements. Non-compete agreements are being amortized
over the terms of the agreements. Goodwill relating to the Quick and LTD
acquisitions totaled approximately $6.4 million and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a life of fifteen years.

The results of operations for the acquired businesses are included in the
consolidated statements of income from the respective acquisition dates
forward.

Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $16.2 million and $9.8 million at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Accumulated amortization of goodwill
and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1.1 million and $300,000 at
each year end, respectively. The net present value of payments required under
the non-compete agreements are included as obligations in long-term debt (see
Note 4).

Effective with the Spin-off, the Company entered into a $20.0 million working
capital line of credit facility with a Tennessee bank which expires in April
2002. Interest rates for advances under the facility vary from LIBOR plus 1.0%
to 1.9% based upon covenants related to total indebtedness, cash flows, results
of operations and other ratios (7.8% and 6.8% at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively). Advances are collateralized primarily by accounts receivable.
The agreement contains, among other things, restrictions that do not allow the
payment of dividends, and requires the maintenance of certain levels of net
worth and other financial ratios. At December 31, 2000, the Company had $1.9
million outstanding under the line and had utilized $4.3 million of
availability for outstanding letters of credit.

Maturities of long-term debt are as follows (in thousands):

5.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS

Preferred Stock -- The Board of Directors is authorized to issue, at its
discretion, up to 5.0 million shares of preferred stock, par value $.01. The
terms and conditions of the preferred shares are to be determined by the Board
of Directors. No shares have been issued to date.

5.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS (CONTINUED)

Common Stock Splits -- On January 10, 2000, the Board of Directors approved a
three-for-two split of the common shares which was distributed on January 28,
2000 to shareholders of record as of January 21, 2000. On February 24, 1999,
the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the common shares which
was distributed on March 19, 1999 to shareholders of record as of March 12,
1999. Common stock issued and additional paid-in capital have been restated to
reflect these splits for all years presented. All common share and per share
data included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have
been restated to give effect to the stock splits.

Employee Stock Option and Incentive Plan -- The Company follows Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. Under
Opinion No. 25, because the exercise price of the Company's employee stock
options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant,
no compensation expense is recognized.

At December 31, 1998, the Company had reserved 3.0 million shares of common
stock under a Stock Option and Incentive Plan. In February 1999, the Company
reserved an additional 1.5 million common shares under the 1999 Stock Option
and Incentive Plan, resulting in a total of 4.5 million shares being reserved
at December 31, 2000 and 1999. Options issued under the Plans have eight to ten
year terms and vest over a four to five year period.

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required
by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which also requires
that the information be determined as if the Company has accounted for its
stock options granted subsequent to December 31, 1994 under the fair value
method of that Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively: risk-free
interest rates of 6.5%, 5.2% and 4.7%; dividend ratio of zero; volatility
factors of the expected market price of the common stock of 0.7, 0.7 and 0.5;
and a weighted-average expected life of the option of seven years.

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company's stock options have characteristics significantly different from
those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the
existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair
value of its stock options.

Exercise prices for options outstanding as of December 31, 2000 ranged from
$2.67 to $37.41.

Under the provisions of the Company's stock option plan, options to purchase
shares of the Company's common stock that were exercisable at the time of the
Spin-off, and that were held by those employees who terminated employment with
the Company and became employees of Landair Corporation upon the Spin-off, were
canceled if not exercised prior to such employees' termination of employment
with the Company. Accordingly, employees that were leaving the Company and
continuing as employees of Landair Corporation exercised 297,000 vested options
during 1998 prior to the Spin-off. Unexercisable options held by employees of
the Company who remained or became employees of Landair Corporation upon
consummation of the Spin-off which totaled 153,000 were converted into options
to purchase Landair Corporation common stock under Landair Corporation's Stock
Option and Incentive Plan. Such conversion was on the basis of a formula
designed to preserve the fair market value of such converted options on the
date of the

Spin-off. All options held by employees of the Company who remained or became
employees of the Company upon consummation of the Spin-off were adjusted on the
basis of a formula designed to preserve the fair market value of such options
on the date of the Spin-off. The adjustment of these options resulted in the
grant of options to purchase 225,000 additional shares during the year ended
December 31, 1998.

Non-Employee Director Options -- In July 2000, May 2000, May 1999 and August
1998, options to purchase 7,500, 15,000, 22,500 and 56,250 shares of common
stock, respectively, were granted to the non-employee directors of the Company
at option prices of $36.38, $33.75, $17.83 and $6.13 per share, respectively.
All options held by directors of the Company as of the Spin-off were adjusted
on the basis of a formula designed to preserve the fair market value of such
options on the date of the Spin-off.

The options have terms of ten years and are exercisable in installments which
vest over two-year periods from the date of grant. At December 31, 2000,
270,000 options are outstanding and will expire in May 2005 through July 2010,
unless a non-employee director resigns or is not re-elected, in which event the
options expire 90 days after the option holder is no longer a non-employee
director.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan -- The Company implemented an employee stock
purchase plan effective January 1, 1996 at which time participating employees
became entitled to purchase common stock through payroll deduction of up to 10%
of the employee's annual compensation. The issue price of the common stock is
equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of market price on the first trading day of the
semi-annual option period or (2) 85% of market price on the last trading day of
the semi-annual option period. The Company has reserved 900,000 shares of
common stock for issuance pursuant to the plan. At December 31, 2000,
approximately 81,000 shares had been issued under the Plan.

7.  LEASES

In September 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with the Rickenbacker
Port Authority ("Rickenbacker") to lease a building located near the Company's
Columbus hub facility in Columbus, Ohio. At the inception of the lease, the
Company made a $2.0 million payment to Rickenbacker. The lease agreement has a
ten year initial term, with two five-year renewal options. The present value of
the future minimum lease payments of $1.0 million (at December 31, 2000) is
included in capital lease obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet. The leased building was recorded in property and equipment at $3.0
million (which represents the present value of minimum lease payments,
including the $2.0 million initial payment, as it is less than the fair value
at the inception date). The building is being depreciated over the initial
lease term, which is less than the estimated useful life of the building.

The Company has a capital lease agreement (with a bargain purchase option)
extending to 2008 with the Director of Development of the State of Ohio for a
terminal facility located in Columbus, Ohio. The amounts due under the lease
have been included in capital lease obligations. The Company is responsible for
all taxes, assessments and other costs of ownership under the lease agreement.
The lease also requires, among other things, restrictions on the payment of
dividends and the maintenance of certain levels of net worth and other
financial ratios. The assets are being amortized over the estimated useful
lives of the assets under the assumption that the bargain purchase option will
be exercised.

The Company leases certain equipment under capital leases. These equipment
leases expire in various years through 2001.

Property and equipment include the following amounts for leases that have been
capitalized:

from one to ten years. Landair Corporation shares certain facilities leased by
the Company, and has been allocated a portion of the rent expense related
thereto (see Note 1 - Common Expenses). As discussed below, the Company entered
into lease or sublease agreements with Landair Corporation related to certain
facilities on or prior to the date of the Spin-off. Sublease rental income was
$465,000, $773,000 and $653,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and was
included in operating revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income.

Included in operating leases is an aircraft leased under a dry lease
arrangement from a limited liability corporation owned by the Company's
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer which expired in July 1999. Under the
terms of the lease agreement, the Company paid the limited liability
corporation $700 per hour of usage subject to a 400 hour per year minimum usage
guarantee. The total net amount of rent expense for this lease was $107,000 and
$423,000 in 1999 and 1998, respectively. Upon expiration of the lease
agreement, the Company commenced chartering the aircraft on an as-needed hourly
basis. The air charter expense totaled $185,000 and $106,000 in 2000 and 1999,
respectively. In addition, during 2000, the Company paid salaries and benefits
of $130,000 for two pilots of the limited liability corporation.

On or prior to the date of the Spin-off, the Company entered into subleases
with Landair Corporation pursuant to which the Company sublet to Landair
Corporation (i) a portion of its terminal facility in Atlanta, Georgia; (ii) a
portion of its terminal facility in Chicago, Illinois; (iii) a portion of its
terminal facility in Detroit, Michigan; and (iv) a portion of the headquarters
of the Company in Greeneville, Tennessee that is leased from the
Greeneville-Greene County Airport Authority. The Company subleases the terminal
facilities to Landair Corporation for consideration based upon the cost of such
facilities to the Company and an agreed-upon percentage of usage. The Company
subleases a portion of Landair Corporation's facility in Indianapolis for
consideration based upon an agreed-upon percentage of usage. The Company
expects to receive aggregate future minimum rental payments under noncancelable
subleases of approximately $950,000.

8.  TRANSACTIONS WITH LANDAIR CORPORATION

The Company and Landair Corporation routinely engage in operating transactions
as Landair Corporation hauls a portion of the deferred air freight shipments
for the Company which are in excess of the Company's scheduled capacity. During
2000, 1999 and 1998, Landair Corporation provided $2.1 million, $3.3 million
and $4.4 million, respectively, of transportation services for the Company
which were included in the accompanying statements of income in purchased
transportation.

In accordance with the terms included in the Transition Services Agreement,
subsequent to the Spin-off the Company provided accounts payable, payroll,
human resources, employee benefit plan administration, owner-operator
settlement, central purchasing, accounting and legal, general administrative,
and information technology services to Landair Corporation. The Company charged
Landair Corporation $1.5 million, $2.4 million and $797,000, respectively,
during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the period September 24,
1998 through December 31, 1998 for these services. In addition, Landair
Corporation provided the Company safety, licensing, permitting and fuel tax,
recruiting and retention, and driver training center services subsequent to the
Spin-off. Landair Corporation charged the Company $230,000, $455,000 and
$193,000, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 and
the period September 24, 1998 through December 31, 1998 for these services.

In connection with the Spin-off, the Company settled all intercompany balances
for cash as of September 23, 1998. At December 31, 2000, accounts receivable
included $315,000 of amounts

due from Landair Corporation related to services covered under the Transition
Services Agreement and various other transactions between both entities. At
December 31, 1999, accounts payable included $707,000 of amounts due to Landair
Corporation related to services covered under the Transition Services Agreement
and various transactions between both entities.

As discussed in Note 7, the Company subleases a portion of certain facilities
to Landair Corporation.

9.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The primary claims in the Company's business are workers' compensation,
property damage, auto liability and medical benefits. Most of the Company's
insurance coverage provides for self-insurance levels with primary and excess
coverage which management believes is sufficient to adequately protect the
Company from catastrophic claims. In the opinion of management, adequate
provision has been made for all incurred claims up to the self-insured limits,
including provision for estimated claims incurred but not reported.

The Company estimates its self-insurance loss exposure by evaluating the merits
and circumstances surrounding individual known claims, and by performing
hindsight analysis to determine an estimate of probable losses on claims
incurred but not reported. Such losses could be realized immediately as the
events underlying the claims have already occurred as of the balance sheet
dates.

Because of the uncertainty of the ultimate resolution of outstanding claims, as
well as uncertainty regarding claims incurred but not reported, it is possible
that management's provision for these losses could change materially in the
near term. However, no estimate can currently be made of the range of
additional loss that is at least reasonably possible.

The estimated cost to complete software development in progress at December 31,
2000 is approximately $500,000.

10.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

The Company has a retirement savings plan (the "401(k) Plan"). The 401(k) Plan
is a defined contribution plan whereby employees who have completed ninety days
of service, a minimum of 1,000 hours of service and are age 21 or older are
eligible to participate. The 401(k) Plan allows eligible employees to make
contributions of 2% to 15% of their annual compensation. Employer contributions
are made at 25% during 2000, 1999 and 1998 of the employee's contribution up to
a maximum of 6% during 2000 and 1999 and 4% during 1998 of total annual
compensation.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

10.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN (CONTINUED)

Employer contributions vest 20% after two years of service and continue vesting
20% per year until fully vested. The Company's matching contribution included
in income from continuing operations for 2000, 1999 and 1998 was approximately
$190,000, $146,000 and $71,000, respectively. In connection with the Spin-off,
the account balances of Truckload employees were transferred to a Landair
Corporation plan in a trust-to-trust transfer during 1999.

11.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Off Balance Sheet Risk

At December 31, 2000, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling
$4.3 million, all of which guarantee obligations carried on the balance sheet.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments and trade
accounts receivable. The Company does not generally require collateral from its
customers. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
receivable are limited due to the large number of entities comprising the
Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

          Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount reported in the
          balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair
          value.

          Accounts receivable and accounts payable: The carrying amounts
          reported in the balance sheet for accounts receivable and accounts
          payable approximate their fair value.

          Long-and short-term debt: The carrying amounts of the Company's
          borrowings under its revolving credit arrangement approximate fair
          value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt and capital
          lease obligations is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses,
          based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for
          similar types of borrowing arrangements.
