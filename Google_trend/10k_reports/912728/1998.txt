                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

         Landair Services, Inc. (the "Company") is a high-service level 
truckload carrier and contractor to the air cargo industry providing
time-definite service in the United States and Canada. The Company was
incorporated in Tennessee in 1981.

         The Company provides scheduled trucking services to air freight
forwarders, fully integrated air cargo carriers and domestic and international
airlines through its Forward Air operations. The Company services its air
freight forwarder, air cargo and airline customers primarily through a hub and
spoke network of 62 terminals, located at or near major airports in the United
States and Canada, and linked through a central sorting facility in Columbus,
Ohio.

         Through its Truckload operations, the Company provides short- to
medium-haul delivery to the high-service segment of the general commodities
truckload market. The Truckload operations include a common carrier operation
that serves customers on an "on demand" basis and a dedicated fleet operation in
which trucks and drivers are dedicated to shippers with specific, high-service
requirements.

         The Truckload and Forward Air operations constitute the business
segments of the Company. An analysis by business segment of operating revenue,
income from operations, assets, expenditures for long-lived assets and other
information as of and for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 is
presented in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning
on page F-20.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

         On February 10, 1998, the Company's Board announced it had authorized
the creation of a special committee of independent directors to consider a plan
to separate the Company into two publicly-traded companies, one comprised of the
Truckload operations, and the other the Forward Air operations. There can be no
assurance as to whether any such transaction will occur or as to the timing or
terms of any such transaction. Under the plan currently being considered, the
transaction would be structured as a tax-free spin-off, subject, among other
things, to the receipt of a ruling as to tax-free status from the Internal
Revenue Service.

FORWARD AIR OPERATIONS

         The Company's Forward Air operations serve the unique and growing
deferred air freight market. Unlike typical overnight letters and packages,
deferred air freight is comprised of freight and packages that will have
time-definite delivery in two to four days. Forward Air receives air



                                       3
<PAGE>   4

freight from air freight forwarder, air cargo and airline customers at 62
terminal facilities and provides airport-to-airport transportation of the
freight to the terminal nearest to the freight's destination. The transportation
requirements of Forward Air are met through direct shuttles, some of which offer
overnight service, and through the Columbus central sorting facility.

         The Company's freight forwarder customers vary in size from small
independent, single facility air freight forwarders to large, international
logistics companies. Since operations were commenced in November 1990, the
average weekly volume of freight carried through the Forward Air network has
grown from approximately 1.2 million pounds to approximately 13.3 million pounds
in 1997. Forward Air operations accounted for approximately 55% of the Company's
1997 operating revenue. The Company's strategy in its Forward Air operations is
to capitalize on the growing market for deferred air freight from both domestic
and international air cargo customers through its unique hub-and-spoke network.

TRUCKLOAD OPERATIONS

         Common Carrier Services. The Company's common carrier operations
primarily consist of short- to medium-haul shipments, typically between 250 and
700 miles. Although serving the contiguous 48 states, the Company's Truckload
operations are primarily concentrated in the eastern half of the United States,
allowing the Company to focus on selected operating lanes. The Company's ability
to stay within these lanes allows it to maximize service for its customers while
minimizing such operating costs as empty miles and driver layovers. The common
carrier operations concentrate on providing a high level of consistent service
at market competitive prices with an emphasis on certain niche markets. For
example, these operations provide common carrier services to certain of the
integrated air carriers and for just-in-time manufacturers with narrow delivery
windows. The customers of the common carrier operations normally demand
scheduled pick-up and delivery and often give short notice for equipment needs.
The common carrier operations have been successful in meeting customer needs
with on-time performance in excess of 98% in its primary service area. The trend
of shippers over the past several years has been toward the use of a relatively
small number of financially stable "core carriers". The Company's strategy in
its common carrier operations is to take advantage of growth opportunities that
exist as a result of this trend. In addition, an important element in the
Company's strategy for expanding its core carrier operations lies in the
cross-utilization of its revenue equipment to satisfy peak demands in the
deferred air freight market.

         Dedicated Contract Carriage Services. The Company's dedicated contract
carriage services involve management for all or a significant part of a
customer's transportation operations. Under a dedicated carriage service
agreement, the Company typically provides drivers, equipment and maintenance,
and, in some instances, transportation management that supplements the
customer's in-house transportation department. This service allows a customer to
reduce overall transportation costs by minimizing both capital expenditures and
personnel costs.

         Management believes the dedicated contract carriage operations are well
positioned to capitalize on the increasing trend of many shippers to outsource
virtually all of their transportation 



                                       4
<PAGE>   5

requirements. The Company's strategy in its dedicated contract carriage
operations will be to continue to focus on expansion of services in this area,
including business with existing common carrier customers, so that the Company's
dedicated operations can ultimately manage most or all of a customer's
transportation needs on a dedicated fleet basis.

         Truckload operations accounted for approximately 45% of the Company's
1997 operating revenue.

REVENUE EQUIPMENT

         The Company purchases high quality tractors to help attract and retain
drivers, promote safe operations and minimize maintenance and repair costs. When
purchasing new revenue equipment, the Company typically acquires standardized
tractors and trailers manufactured to the Company's specifications.
Standardization enables the Company to simplify driver training, control the
cost of spare parts inventory and enhance its preventive maintenance program.

         The Company has purchased most of its tractors from Freightliner
Corporation and its trailers from Great Dane Corporation. The majority of the
tractors purchased are equipped with Series 60 Detroit Diesel electronic engines
which have contributed significantly to increased fuel efficiency. It is the
Company's current practice to trade in its tractors after three or four years
and its trailers after seven years. The Company's purchase and lease agreements
for tractors generally provide for a repurchase option by the manufacturer at
predetermined prices.

         As of December 31, 1997, the Company owned or leased 670 tractors and
contracted for 425 tractors from owner-operators. The average age of the
Company-operated tractor fleet was approximately 2.7 years at December 31, 1997.
As of December 31, 1997, the Company owned or leased 2,290 van trailers, of
which substantially all are 53' long and 285 include specialized roller bed
equipment required to serve air cargo industry customers. By having a majority
of the Company's trailer fleet equipped with 53' trailers, the Company is able
to provide its customers with more economy and convenience and increased driver
productivity. The average age of the trailer fleet was approximately 3.2 years
at December 31, 1997.

         The Company has installed Qualcomm two-way satellite communication
systems in the majority of its tractors. The Qualcomm system provides the
Company with continuous communications capability in the event a driver
experiences a service delay or disruption. The Qualcomm system also allows the
Company to track the exact location and route of any particular shipment and
communicate instantly with drivers to improve operating efficiencies.

EMPLOYEES AND OWNER-OPERATOR DRIVERS

         As of December 31, 1997, the Company employed approximately 2,000
persons. None of the Company's employees are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.



                                       5
<PAGE>   6


         The Company recognizes that its professional driver workforce is one of
its most valuable assets. Drivers are selected by the Company in accordance with
guidelines relating to safety records, driving experience and personal
evaluations. Over the past several years, the Company has introduced several
driver retention programs including the creation of a pay package that more
fairly compensates drivers for the work associated with their job. The pay
package includes extra pay items in addition to the drivers' mileage-based pay.
The expense and cost of driver retention and recruitment has increased in recent
years. Recruitment is difficult due to Company standards and an industry
shortage of qualified drivers. See "Safety".

         The Company also recognizes that the selection process for
owner-operators is equally as important as for Company drivers. As of December
31, 1997, approximately 41% of the tractors in service were contracted to the
Company by owner-operators. Approximately half of the December 31, 1997
owner-operators were utilized in each of the Forward Air and Truckload
operations. The use of owner-operators provides the Company with marketing,
operating, safety, driver recruiting, retention and financial advantages. The
Company focuses on the special needs of owner-operators through programs
designed to reduce their operating costs. The Company plans to continue its
emphasis on recruiting owner-operators.

SAFETY

         The Company has an active safety and loss prevention program and has
established a driver qualification policy. Drivers who exceed the maximum
acceptable number of accidents or traffic citations within a specified time
period are reviewed and monitored by the safety department. The driving and
employment records of drivers are verified.

         During the past three years, the Company enhanced its safety program
with a series of safe driving campaigns, safety contests, quarterly driver
terminal safety meetings, and communication of safety data to drivers and
management personnel. The program is designed to heighten awareness of, and
focus attention on, safety related issues.

INSURANCE

         Claims exposure in the transportation industry consists primarily of
cargo loss and damage, vehicle liability, property damage and workers'
compensation. The Company maintains a deductible for auto liability claims, for
physical damage claims and for cargo claims. The Company also is responsible for
a significant deductible for workers' compensation claims. The Company maintains
insurance with independent insurance carriers that provide certain coverage for
claims in excess of deductible amounts. Management believes that the Company's
insurance coverage is reasonable.

REGULATION

         Prior to December 29, 1995, the Company's operations in interstate
commerce were regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission ("ICC"). Effective
December 29, 1995, 



                                       6
<PAGE>   7

President Clinton signed into law the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination
Act of 1995 which closed the ICC and transferred its remaining responsibilities
to a new Surface Transportation Board and the Federal Highway Administration. In
addition, interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements
prescribed by the Department of Transportation. Such matters as weight and
dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. The
Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations. Management believes that the Company is in substantial compliance
with applicable regulatory requirements relating to its operations. Failure of
the Company to comply with the applicable regulations could result in
substantial fines or revocation of the Company's operating permits.

         The Company has aboveground fuel storage tanks at its Atlanta, Georgia;
Indianapolis, Indiana and Memphis, Tennessee facilities and underground fuel
storage tanks at its Columbus, Ohio facility. Such storage tanks are subject to
various federal and state environmental laws and regulations. Management
believes that the Company is in substantial compliance with applicable
environmental laws and regulations. No material increase for expenditures for
compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations is
anticipated in 1998.

COMPETITION AND INDUSTRY TRENDS

         The Company competes with regional, inter-regional and national
truckload carriers and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload carriers,
railroads and overnight delivery companies. Many of the Company's competitors
have greater financial resources, more equipment or larger freight capacity than
the Company. Service and price are the principal means of competition in the
transportation industry.

         Management believes the market for its Forward Air operations will be
less affected by competition than will most other segments of the transportation
industry because of its unique network. The transportation of air freight
requires significant capital assets, including a fleet of dependable equipment,
a large centrally located sorting facility, an extensive communication system, a
skilled workforce and a large sales operation. In order to effectively compete,
any new entrant would have to be able to immediately develop a comparable
network which would require it to dedicate a full complement of equipment and
establish multiple terminals in order to demonstrate the ability to handle a
large number of shipments destined for many geographically diverse locations and
to meet critical delivery deadlines.

         The Company's principal competitive strength is its ability to
consistently provide reliable service at a competitive price. Many of the
Company's customers are high volume shippers which require a flexible and
dependable motor carrier service tailored to their specific needs, including
pick-up and delivery within specified time frames.

         During 1997, one customer of the Truckload operations, Federal Express
Corporation, accounted for more than 10% (approximately $27.0 million) of the
Company's consolidated 



                                       7
<PAGE>   8

operating revenue. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the
Company's operating revenue in 1996 and 1995.

SEASONALITY

         In the trucking industry, revenue and operating results generally
reflect a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the
winter holiday season and during the summer months. Additionally, the volume of
shipments is often affected by weather variations. The Company's operating
expenses also have historically been higher in the winter months, due primarily
to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs of revenue
equipment in colder weather.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

         The Company's headquarters, comprised of 37,500 square feet, are
located in Greeneville, Tennessee and are leased from the Greeneville-Greene
County Airport Authority under a lease expiring in 2006. The headquarters lease
is at a rate management believes is favorable. The Company leases, under a
capital lease agreement, a 100-door cross dock hub facility constructed in 1994
in Columbus, Ohio from the Director of Development of the State of Ohio. A
substantial portion of the cost of constructing the 83,800 square foot Columbus
facility shared by the Forward Air and Truckload operations was funded by the
State of Ohio through the sale of $6.3 million of revenue bonds. The Company is
responsible for all taxes, assessments and other costs of ownership under the
lease agreement. Certain terms of the lease include restrictions on the payment
of dividends and the maintenance of certain levels of net worth and other
financial ratios. After the bonds are paid in full, the Company will have an
option to purchase the terminal for a nominal amount.

         The Company owns a 46,000 square foot 68-door cross dock terminal
facility in Atlanta, Georgia, which houses both the Atlanta Truckload and
Forward Air operations. The Company also acquired 27.3 acres of land in Mosheim,
Tennessee in 1997 on which it is constructing a facility for its Truckload
operations.

         The Company leases a 15,200 square foot facility for its Truckload and
Forward Air operations in Indianapolis, Indiana and leases two separate
facilities for its Memphis, Tennessee Forward Air and Truckload operations which
total approximately 19,875 square feet.

         The Company leases 49 additional terminal facilities for its Forward
Air operations, which are typically leased on a short-term (three to five year)
basis. Management believes that replacement space comparable to these terminal
facilities is readily obtainable, if necessary. Management believes that its
facilities are adequate to support its current operations. The balance of the
Forward Air terminals are agent stations leased and operated by independent
agents who generally handle the Company's freight on a commission basis.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

LITIGATION

         The Company is, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the
normal course of its business, most of which involve claims for personal injury
and property damage incurred in connection with the transportation of freight.
Management believes that none of these actions, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company.


ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997,
no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders through the solicitation
of proxies or otherwise.

         There were approximately 1,200 shareholders of record (including
brokerage firms and other nominees) of the Company's common stock as of January
30, 1998.

         The Company has not paid cash dividends on its common stock in the two
preceding fiscal years, and it is the current intention of management to retain
earnings to finance the growth of the Company's business. Future payment of
dividends will depend upon the financial condition, results of operations,
contractual restrictions and capital requirements of the Company, as well as
other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.

</TABLE>


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         Operating revenue for 1997 increased to a record $190.4 million
compared to $157.1 million in 1996 and $148.1 million in 1995. The increases in
operating revenue for 1997 and 1996 were 21.2% and 6.1%, respectively.

         Purchased transportation was 32.1% of operating revenue in 1997
compared to 32.8% in 1996 and 36.1% in 1995. The decrease in purchased
transportation as a percentage of operating revenue between these years was
primarily attributable to a reduction in the ratio of owner-operators to Company
drivers during 1997 and 1996. During 1997, 1996 and 1995, approximately 41.0%,
42.0% and 46.0% of the Company's average tractors in service were contracted
through owner-operators.

         Salaries, wages and benefits were 28.4% of operating revenue in 1997
compared to 27.6% in 1996 and 25.4% in 1995. The increase as a percentage of
operating revenue in 1997 and 1996 were due primarily to higher cargo handling
wages and terminal managers' salaries required to operate additional terminals
and greater operating volumes in the Company's Forward Air operations combined
with an increase in the ratio of Company drivers to owner-operators.



                                       12
<PAGE>   13


         Fuel and fuel taxes were 6.1% of operating revenue in 1997 compared to
6.9% in 1996 and 6.0% in 1995. The decrease in fuel and fuel taxes as a
percentage of operating revenue during 1997 resulted from a lower average fuel
price per gallon coupled with improvements in the average miles per gallon and
average revenue per loaded mile of the Company-operated tractor fleet. The
increase in fuel and fuel taxes as a percentage of operating revenue during 1996
was primarily attributed to an increase in fuel prices and an increase in the
ratio of Company drivers to owner-operators. Approximately 60.0% of the increase
in fuel prices during 1996 was passed on to customers in the form of a fuel
surcharge.

         Operating leases were 3.4%, 3.8% and 4.0% of operating revenue during
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, while depreciation and amortization were
5.9%, 6.7% and 5.9% during the same periods. The decrease in operating leases as
a percentage of operating revenue during 1997 and 1996 resulted from increased
ownership, rather than leasing, of revenue equipment. The decrease in
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of operating revenue is
attributable to substantial improvements in equipment utilization during 1997,
partially offset by increased ownership of revenue equipment. The increase in
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of operating revenue during 1996
is attributable to an increase in the ratio of Company drivers to
owner-operators and increased ownership of revenue equipment.

         Insurance and claims were 5.0% of operating revenue in 1997 compared to
5.3% in 1996 and 4.8% in 1995. The changes in insurance and claims expense
during 1997 and 1996 resulted from fluctuations in the frequency and severity of
accidents between years coupled with changes in claims development trends and
lower premium costs.

         Other operating expenses were 10.3% of operating revenue in 1997
compared to 11.0% in 1996 and 10.7% in 1995. The decrease in 1997 as a
percentage of operating revenue is attributed to both a reduced operating cost
structure and improvements in utilization levels in the Company's Truckload
operations. Gains (losses) on the sale of revenue equipment (which are netted
against other operating expenses) were $(109,000), $413,000, and $503,000 during
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

         Interest expense was $2.6 million in 1997 compared to $3.0 million in
1996 and 1995. The decrease in interest expense during 1997 is due to lower
average net borrowing during the period.

         Other income (expense), net, includes a loss on the disposal of 
non-operating equipment of $276,000, $0 and $0 during 1997, 1996 and 1995, 
respectively.

         The combined federal and state effective tax rates for 1997, 1996 and
1995 were 39.0%, 38.2% and 42.0%, respectively. For information concerning the
provision for income taxes, as well as information regarding differences between
effective tax rates and statutory rates, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.



                                       13
<PAGE>   14


         Forward Air Segment: Operating revenue in the Company's Forward Air
operations increased by $24.4 and $17.2 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively,
and represented approximately 55.0% and 51.0% of the Company's operating revenue
for these periods. Operating revenue increases in the Forward Air operations
resulted from increasing the number of operating terminals, enhancements to the
Forward Air network and greater volume from domestic and international air cargo
customers. The operating revenue increase in 1997 is also partially attributed
to the acquisition on October 27, 1997 of the air cargo operating assets of
Adams Air Cargo, Inc.

         Forward Air income from operations increased by $4.5 and $2.1 million
in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The increase in income from operations resulted
from higher operating revenue, which was reduced in part by the incremental
costs associated with such revenue. In addition, during the third quarter of
1997, the Forward Air operations benefited from non-recurring revenue that
resulted from the United Parcel Service strike. This additional revenue, net of
variable costs, resulted in an estimated additional $1.2 million of income from
operations.

         Truckload Segment: Operating revenue in the Company's Truckload
operations, including intersegment revenue, increased (decreased) by $9.6 and
$(6.0) million in 1997 and 1996, respectively. Operating revenue increases
(decreases) in the Truckload operations resulted primarily from fluctuations in
equipment utilization and yield. During 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Truckload
operations utilized average tractors of 699, 695 and 685, respectively.

         Truckload income from operations increased (decreased) by $2.9 and
$(3.3) million in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The increase in income from
operations in 1997 was due mainly to a lower operating cost ratio resulting from
an increase in equipment utilization and yield during the year. The decrease in
income from operations in 1996 was due primarily to a higher operating ratio
resulting from a decrease in equipment utilization and yield during the year. In
addition, during the third quarter of 1997, the Truckload operations benefited
from non-recurring revenue generated from the United Parcel Service strike. This
additional revenue, net of variable costs, resulted in an estimated additional
$200,000 of income from operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         The continued growth of the Company's business, and the nature of its
operations, have required significant investment in new equipment. The Company
has historically financed revenue equipment purchases with cash flows from
operations, through borrowing under credit agreements with financial
institutions and from proceeds of the initial public offering in November 1993.
Working capital needs have generally been met with cash flows from operations
and borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Net cash provided by operating
activities totaled approximately $22.6, $12.5 and $15.8 million in 1997, 1996
and 1995, respectively.

         Net cash used in investment activities was approximately $19.0, $6.0
and $21.5 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Investing activities
consisted primarily of the acquisition of additional revenue equipment and
enhanced management information systems during 1997, 



                                       14
<PAGE>   15

1996 and 1995, the acquisition of a business in 1997 and the acquisition of a
terminal facility in 1996.

         Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was approximately
$(2.9), $(10.3) and $8.6 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. These
financing activities included the Company's continued financing of additional
revenue equipment, based upon capital expenditure requirements, coupled with
repayment of long-term debt and capital leases with cash generated from
operations.

         The Company expects net capital expenditures in 1998 for revenue
equipment and management information systems, excluding acquisitions, to be less
than $25 million. The Company expects to fund these expenditures through cash
provided by operating activities. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information concerning credit arrangements. At
December 31, 1997, the Company had a line of credit with a bank in the amount of
$15.0 million, which expires in May 1999. At December 31, 1997, approximately
$4.7 million was available for borrowing under the credit line. At December 31,
1997, the Company also had equipment loan agreements which permit the Company to
borrow up to $30.0 million for the purchase of revenue equipment. At December
31, 1997, approximately $15.9 million was available for borrowing under the
equipment loan agreements. Management believes that available borrowings under
the line of credit agreement, equipment loan agreements, future borrowings under
installment notes for revenue equipment, and cash generated by operations will
be sufficient to fund its cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures
through at least 1998.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

         Inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's results of
operations or financial condition during the past three years. However,
inflation higher than experienced during the past three years could have an
adverse effect on the Company's future results.

IMPACT OF YEAR 2000

         Some of the Company's older computer programs and systems were written
using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year. As a result,
those computer programs have time-sensitive software that recognize a date using
"00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could cause a system
failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations, including, among
other things, a temporary inability to process transactions, send invoices, or
engage in similar normal business activities.

         The Company has been in the process of replacing the majority of its
key financial and operational systems as a part of upgrading its legacy systems
in the normal course of business. This replacement has been a planned approach
for the last two years to enhance or better meet its functional business and
operational requirements. Management believes that this program will
substantially meet or address its Year 2000 issues. In addition to its
replacement program, the Company will require modifying some of its software and
hardware so that its computer systems 



                                       15
<PAGE>   16

will function properly with respect to dates in the year 2000 and thereafter.
The estimated cost of the remaining replacement and modification for the Year
2000 issue is not considered material to the Company's earnings or financial
position.

         The Company also plans to initiate a formal communication process with
all its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to
which the Company's interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties'
failure to remediate their own Year 2000 issues. There is no guarantee that the
systems of other companies on which the Company's systems rely will be timely
converted and would not have an adverse effect on the Company's system.

         The project is estimated to be completed not later than December 31,
1998, which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems. The
Company believes that with modifications to existing software and hardware and
conversions to new software, the Year 2000 issue will not pose significant
operational problems for its computer systems. However, if such modifications
and conversions are not made, or are not completed timely, the Year 2000 issue
could have a material impact on the operations of the Company.

IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. The
Statement is effective for the Company beginning in 1998, and establishes
standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its
components. The Statement requires that all items that are income be reported in
a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other
financial statements. The Company does not expect the effect of adoption of
Statement 130 to be material to the consolidated financial statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

         The Company, or its executive officers and directors on behalf of the
Company, may from time to time make written or oral "forward-looking
statements". Written forward-looking statements may appear in documents filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), in press releases and in
reports to shareholders. Oral forward-looking statements may be made by the
Company's executive officers and directors on behalf of the Company to the
press, potential investors, securities analysts and others. The Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 contains a safe harbor for
forward-looking statements. The Company relies on this safe harbor in making
such disclosures. In connection with this "safe harbor" provision, the Company

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP COMPLIANCE

         Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange
Act") and the disclosure requirements of Item 405 of Regulation S-K require the
directors and executive officers of the Company, and any persons who
beneficially own more than ten percent of any registered class of equity
securities of the Company, to report their ownership of such equity securities
and any subsequent changes in that ownership to the SEC, The Nasdaq Stock Market
and the Company. Based solely on a review of the written statements and copies
of such reports furnished to the Company by its executive officers and
directors, the Company believes that during fiscal 1997 all Section 16(a) filing
requirements applicable to its executive officers, directors and shareholders
were timely satisfied, except that Bruce A. Campbell inadvertently filed a late
Form 4 in connection with the sale of 2,600 shares in July 1997.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

         Employee directors of the Company do not receive additional
compensation for Board or committee service. In lieu of an annual retainer,
non-employee directors are paid a fee of $1,500 for each Board meeting and
$1,500 for each committee meeting attended, together with reasonable traveling
expenses. No additional fee is paid for committee meetings held on the same day
as Board meetings.

         Each of the non-employee directors of the Company was granted upon the
effectiveness of the Company's initial public offering options to purchase
15,000 shares of the common stock pursuant to a non-qualified option agreement
at an exercise price equal to the then applicable fair market value ($14.00 per
share). In May 1995, at the Chairman's request, the Board of Directors approved,
subject to appropriate shareholder approval obtained at the May 1996 Annual
Meeting, adoption of a Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan which provided
that the existing non-employee directors receive an option for the purchase of
7,500 shares at an exercise price equal to the closing sales price of the common
stock on May 16, 1995 ($13.625 per share). Thereafter, the Plan provides that on
the first business day following each annual meeting of shareholders (beginning
with the May 1996 Annual Meeting) each non-employee director be granted an
option for the purchase of 7,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price
equal to the closing sales price of the common stock on the date of grant.
Accordingly, on May 22, 1996 and May 21, 1997, each non-employee director
received an option to purchase 7,500 shares at an exercise price of $15.00 and
$14.00 per share, respectively. Each individual who subsequently becomes a
non-employee director shall automatically be granted an option to purchase 7,500
shares of common stock on the first business day after becoming a director.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS, TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE IN CONTROL 
ARRANGEMENTS

         The Company's Employment Agreement with Edward W. Cook expired December
31, 1997. Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, Mr. Cook's base salary was
$100,000 per annum, subject to increases approved by the Company's Board of
Directors, and Mr. Cook agreed not to engage in certain activities in
competition with the Company for a period of one year following termination of
his employment.

         Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or Potential Change in
Control (as such terms are described below) under the Company's Stock Option and
Incentive Plan, all outstanding options and any stock appreciation rights that
have been outstanding for at least six months will become fully exercisable and
vested, and the restrictions applicable to the benefits available under any
other award under the Stock Option and Incentive Plan will lapse, unless
otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the
Board of Directors. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at or after
grant but prior to the occurrence of any Change in Control, the value of all
vested options and other awards granted under the Stock Option and Incentive
Plan will be cashed out at the Change in Control Price upon the occurrence of a
Change in Control or Potential Change in Control. Options and other awards
granted to executive


                                       23
<PAGE>   24
officers, directors and other persons who are subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act will only be cashed out if they have been held for at least six
months and, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Change in Control
or Potential Change in Control was outside the control of the holder of the
option or other award.

         Under the Stock Option and Incentive Plan, a "Change in Control" is
defined to include (i) any change in control that would be required to be
reported in response to any form or report to the SEC, or any stock exchange on
which the Company's shares are listed, (ii) the acquisition by any person (other
than the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries) of beneficial ownership of securities of
the Company representing twenty percent or more of the combined voting power of
the Company or (iii) a change in the Board of Directors of the Company if, as a
result of such change, the persons who were the members of the Board of
Directors two years prior to such change cease to constitute at least a majority
of the members of the Board of Directors. Persons who were elected by or on the
recommendation or approval of at least three-quarters of the members of the
Board of Directors who were in office at the beginning of such period are deemed
to have been in office during such two year period for purposes of this
provision. A Change in Control is also deemed to occur if a majority of the
members of the Committee in office prior to the happening of any event
determines in its sole discretion that as a result of such event there has been
a change in control. A "Potential Change in Control" is deemed to occur upon (i)
the approval by shareholders of any agreement which, if consummated, would
result in a Change in Control, or (ii) the acquisition by any person (other than
the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries) of beneficial ownership of securities of the
Company representing five percent or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's securities and the adoption by the Committee of a resolution to the
effect that a Potential Change in Control of the Company has occurred. The
"Change in Control Price" is defined as the highest price per share paid for the
common stock in any transaction reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market or any other
exchange or market that is the principal trading market for the common stock or
any other bona fide transaction related to such Change in Control or Potential
Change in Control at any time during the sixty day period prior to the Change in
Control or Potential Change in Control. In the case of incentive stock options
and stock appreciation rights related thereto, the Change in Control Price is
determined based solely on transactions reported for the date on which the
cash-out or the exercise of the stock appreciation right occurs.

        SEC require that every person who has or shares the power to vote or 
        dispose of shares of stock be reported as a "beneficial owner" of all
        shares as to which such power exists. As a consequence, many persons may
        be deemed to be the "beneficial owners" of the same securities. The SEC
        rules also require that certain shares of stock that a beneficial owner
        has the right to acquire within  sixty days of the date set forth above
        pursuant to the exercise of stock options are deemed to be outstanding 
        for the purpose of calculating the percentage ownership of such owner,

        percentage ownership of any other person.

       sole power to vote or direct any shares, shared power to vote or direct
       261,000 shares, no power to dispose of or to direct disposition of any 
       shares and shared power to dispose of or direct disposition of 435,600 
       shares.

                         Report of Independent Auditors


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Landair Services, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Landair
Services, Inc. as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1997. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Landair Services,
Inc. at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                                December 31, 1997

1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. Significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Effective December 31, 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information. Statement 131 superseded Statement No. 14, Financial 
Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise. Statement 131 establishes
standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about
operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those
enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim
financial reports. Statement 131 also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.
The adoption of Statement 131 did not affect results of operations or financial
position, but did affect the disclosure of segment information. Segment
information for all periods has been presented to conform to Statement 131
requirements. See Note 7.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

OWNERSHIP

Scott M. Niswonger (Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer) was the
majority owner of the Company's common stock during all periods presented.

OPERATING REVENUE

Operating revenue and related costs are recognized as of the date shipments are
completed.

1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

INVENTORIES

Inventories of tires, replacement parts, supplies and fuel for revenue equipment
are stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the FIFO (first-in, 
first-out) method of determining cost.


PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and
equipment is calculated based upon the cost of the asset, reduced by its
estimated salvage value, using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives as follows:

             Buildings                                30-40 years
             Revenue equipment                         3-7  years
             Other equipment                           3-10 years
             Leasehold improvements                    1-15 years

Interest payments during 1997, 1996 and 1995 were $2,631,000, $3,011,000 and
$2,981,000, respectively. No interest was capitalized during the three years
ended December 31, 1997. During 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company added to
revenue and other equipment $1,563,000, $2,417,000 and $2,682,000 of capital
leases, respectively.

INSURANCE AND CLAIMS ACCRUALS

The primary claims in the Company's business are workers' compensation, property
damage, auto liability and medical benefits. Most of the Company's insurance
coverage provides for self-insurance levels with primary and excess coverage
which management believes is sufficient to adequately protect the Company from
catastrophic claims. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been
made for all incurred claims up to the self-insured limits.

             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)


1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

NET INCOME PER SHARE

In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 128,
Earnings Per Share. Statement 128 replaced the calculation of primary and fully
diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike
primary earnings per share, basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive
effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per
share is very similar to the previously reported fully diluted earnings per
share, and uses the treasury stock method in calculating dilution. All earnings
per share amounts for all periods have been presented and restated to conform to
Statement 128 requirements.

STOCK OPTIONS

The Company grants options for a fixed number of shares to employees and outside
directors with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the
grant date. The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense for the stock
option grants.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income. The Statement is effective for the Company
beginning in 1998, and establishes standards for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components. The Statement requires that all items
that are income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the
same prominence as other financial statements. The Company does not expect the
effect of adoption of Statement 130 to be material to the consolidated financial
statements.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements
to conform to the 1997 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on
net income.

2.  ACQUISITION OF BUSINESS

On October 27, 1997, the Company acquired the air cargo operating assets of
Adams Air Cargo, Inc., a surface transportation contractor to the air cargo
industry based in Arbuckle, California. The Company paid approximately
$1,209,000 in cash, issued a note payable of $1,800,000, and assumed debt and
capital lease obligations of $967,000 and $1,563,000, respectively. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the purchase price was
allocated on the basis of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired,
resulting in goodwill of approximately $2,764,000. The goodwill is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a life of 20 years. Accumulated
amortization of the goodwill totaled $23,000 at December 31, 1997. The results
of operations for the acquired business were included in the consolidated
statement of income from the acquisition date forward. Pro forma results of
operations for 1997 and 1996 would not differ materially from the Company's
historical results.

3. LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consists of the following:

3. LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)

The Company has a $15 million line of credit agreement with a Tennessee bank
which expires in May 1999. Advances outstanding under the line bear interest at
the bank's base rate less 1.0% (7.5% and 7.3% at December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively) and are collateralized primarily by accounts receivable. The
agreement contains, among other things, restrictions that do not allow the
payment of dividends, and requires the maintenance of certain levels of net
worth and other financial ratios. At December 31, 1997, the Company had
$2,163,000 outstanding under the line and had utilized $8,104,000 of
availability for outstanding letters of credit.

The Company has equipment loan agreements (the "Equipment Loan Agreements") with
two Tennessee banks which permit the Company to borrow up to $30 million for the
purchase of revenue equipment. Advances outstanding under the Equipment Loan
Agreements bear interest at the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 1.0% to 1.6% (6.7% to
7.3% and 6.4% to 7.0% at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively). The advances
are collateralized by revenue equipment purchased with the proceeds from the
Equipment Loan Agreements, and contain restrictions and covenants similar to the
line of credit agreement described above. At December 31, 1997, the Company had
additional borrowing capacity available of $15,893,000 under the Equipment Loan
Agreements.

Revenue equipment collateralizing these agreements has a carrying value of
approximately $27,678,000 and $27,221,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1996, 
respectively.

Maturities of long-term debt are as follows (in thousands):

4. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS (CONTINUED)

Employee Stock Option and Incentive Plan -- The Company has elected to follow
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting
provided for under Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options. Under Opinion No. 25, because the exercise price
of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.

At December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company had reserved 1,000,000 shares
of common stock under a Stock Option and Incentive Plan. Options issued under
the Plan have eight to ten year terms and vest over a four to five year period.

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
Statement 123, which also requires that the information be determined as if the
Company has accounted for its employee and non-employee director stock options
granted subsequent to December 31, 1994 under the fair value method of that
Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively: risk-free interest rates of
5.8%, 6.4% and 5.5%; dividend ratio of zero; volatility factors of the expected
market price of the Company's common stock of .5; and a weighted-average
expected life of the option of seven years.

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company's employee and non-employee director stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee
and non-employee director stock options.

4. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS (CONTINUED)

The options have terms of five to ten years and are exercisable in installments
which vest over two-year periods from the date of grant. At December 31, 1997,
75,000 options are outstanding and will expire on September 1, 1998 through May
1, 2007, unless a non-employee director resigns or is not re-elected, in which
event the options expire 90 days after the option holder is no longer a
non-employee director.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan -- The Company implemented an employee stock
purchase plan effective January 1, 1996 at which time participating employees
became entitled to purchase common stock through payroll deduction of up to 10%
of the employee's annual compensation. The issue price of the common stock is
equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of market price on the first trading day of the
semi-annual enrollment period or (2) 85% of market price on the last trading day
of the semi-annual enrollment period. The Company has reserved 300,000 shares of
common stock for issuance pursuant to the plan. At December 31, 1997,
approximately 16,000 shares had been issued under the Plan.

Earnings Per Share -- The following table sets forth the computation of basic
and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):

Management believes that the deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized.
Management's conclusion is based on future taxable income that will result from
the reversal of the existing temporary differences. Additionally, management
expects future taxable income from operations, exclusive of the reversal of
temporary differences.

The balance sheet classification of deferred income taxes is as follows:

6. LEASES

During October 1993, the Company entered into a capital lease agreement (with a
bargain purchase option) with the Director of Development of the State of Ohio
for the construction of a terminal facility located in Columbus, Ohio. To fund
the construction of the new facility, the State of Ohio sold revenue bonds in
the amount of $6,280,000. The amounts due under the lease have been included in
capital lease obligations. The Company is responsible for all taxes, assessments
and other costs of ownership under the lease agreement. The lease also requires,
among other things, restrictions on the payment of dividends and the maintenance
of certain levels of net worth and other financial ratios.

The Company leases certain revenue and other equipment under capital leases.
These leases expire in various years through 2001. Certain of the revenue
equipment leases contain guarantees of residual values which have been included
in minimum lease payments.

Property and equipment include the following amounts for leases that have been
capitalized:

Amortization of leased assets is included in depreciation and amortization
expense.

The Company also leases certain facilities and revenue equipment under
noncancelable operating leases that expire in various years through 2006.
Certain of these leases may be renewed for periods varying from one to ten
years.

Included in operating leases is a terminal facility leased from a company
wholly-owned by the Company's majority shareholder which expired in January 1997
and the lease was not renewed. Also included in operating leases is an aircraft
leased, under a dry lease agreement, from the Company's majority shareholder
which expires in July 1998 and may be renewed for an additional

7. BUSINESS SEGMENTS

DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPES OF SERVICES FROM WHICH EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT DERIVES
ITS REVENUE

The Truckload and Forward Air operating divisions constitute the operating
segments of the Company.

The Forward Air operations provide scheduled trucking services to air freight
forwarders, fully integrated air cargo carriers and domestic and international
airlines. The Forward Air operation services its air freight forwarders, air
cargo and airline customers primarily through a hub and spoke network of
terminals located at or near major airports in the United States and Canada and
linked through a central sorting facility in Columbus, Ohio.

The Truckload operations provide short- to medium-haul delivery to the
high-service segment of the general commodities truckload market. The Truckload
operation includes a common carrier

operation that serves customers on an "on demand" basis and a dedicated fleet
operation in which trucks and drivers are dedicated to shippers with specific,
high-service requirements.

MEASUREMENT OF SEGMENT INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND SEGMENT ASSETS

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in Note 1. The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources
based on operating income. The Company does not allocate interest expense to
reportable segments.

Intersegment revenue is accounted for at rates comparable to unaffiliated
customers.

FACTORS MANAGEMENT USED TO IDENTIFY THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

The Company's reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
different services. The reportable segments are each managed separately because
they provide different services with different operating processes and marketing
strategies.

A summary of information about the Company's operations by segment for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 is as follows (in thousands):

7. BUSINESS SEGMENTS (CONTINUED)

The reconciling item to adjust total assets is the amount of income tax
assets, which are not included in segment information.

MAJOR CUSTOMER

One customer of the Truckload segment, Federal Express Corporation, accounted
for more than 10% (approximately $27,050,000) of the Company's consolidated
operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 1997. No single customer
accounted for more than 10% of operating revenue in 1996 and 1995.


8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the normal
course of its business, most of which involve claims for personal injury and
property damage incurred in connection with the transportation of freight.
Management believes that none of these actions, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company.


9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

Effective July 1, 1994, the Company adopted a retirement savings plan (the
"401(k) Plan"). The 401(k) Plan is a defined contribution plan whereby employees
who have completed one year of service, a minimum of 1,000 hours of service and
are age 21 or older are eligible to participate. The 401(k) Plan allows eligible
employees to make contributions of 2% to 10% of their annual compensation.
Employer contributions are made at 25% of the employee's contribution up to a
maximum of 4% of total annual compensation. Employer contributions vest 20%
after two years of service and continue vesting 20% per year until fully vested.
The Company's matching contribution for 1997, 1996 and 1995 was approximately
$145,000, $131,000 and $119,000, respectively.

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Off Balance Sheet Risk

At December 31, 1997, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling
$8,104,000, all of which guarantee obligations carried on the balance sheet.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments and trade
accounts receivable. The Company does not generally require collateral from its
customers. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
receivable are limited due to the large number of entities comprising the
Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its
fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

     Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount reported in the balance
     sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates its fair value.

     Accounts receivable and accounts payable: The carrying amounts reported in
     the balance sheet for accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
     their fair value.

     Long-and short-term debt: The carrying amounts of the Company's borrowings
     under its revolving credit arrangement approximate fair value. The fair
     value of the Company's long-term debt and capital lease obligations is
     estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's
     current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
     arrangements.

11. QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

During the third quarter of 1997, the Company benefited from non-recurring
revenue that resulted from the United Parcel Service strike. This additional
revenue net of variable costs and income taxes, but not allocated fixed costs,
resulted in an estimated additional $1.4 million of pre-tax income from
operations and $0.14 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter.

The 1996 and first three quarters of 1997 earnings per share amounts have been
restated to comply with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,
Earnings Per Share.
