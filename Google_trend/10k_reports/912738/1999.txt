ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business

The registrant,  FFLC Bancorp,  Inc.  ("FFLC" or the  "Company"),  completed its
public  offering of 4,603,032  shares  (adjusted  for stock split) of its common
stock and acquired  First  Federal  Savings  Bank of Lake County  ("the  Savings
Bank")  in  connection  with the  Savings  Bank's  conversion  from a  federally
chartered mutual savings association to a federally chartered stock savings bank
on January 4, 1994. The net conversion  proceeds  totaled $26.6 million of which
$13.3 million was invested in the Savings Bank and $13.3 million was retained by
the  registrant.  The  registrant  loaned  $2.2  million to the  Employee  Stock
Ownership  Plan and the remaining  $11.1  million has been invested  through the
Savings Bank. The  registrant,  which was  incorporated in Delaware on September
16, 1993, is a savings and loan holding  company and is subject to regulation by
the Office of Thrift Supervision  ("OTS"). The registrant has not transacted any
material  business  other than  through its  subsidiary,  the Savings  Bank.  At
December  31,  1998,  the  Company  had  total  assets  of  $463.8  million  and
stockholders' equity of $53.2 million.

The Savings Bank was established in 1934 as a federally-chartered mutual savings
and loan association. The Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank
("FHLB")  System and its deposit  accounts are insured to the maximum  allowable
amount by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC").  At December 31,
1998,  the Savings  Bank had total  assets of $463.8  million and  stockholders'
equity of $46.3 million.

The principal  business of the Savings Bank is attracting  retail  deposits from
the general  public and  investing  those  deposits,  together with payments and
repayments  on loans  and  investments  and  funds  generated  from  operations,
primarily in mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family  owner-occupied homes,
commercial loans and securities,  and, to a lesser extent,  construction  loans,
consumer  and other loans,  and  multi-family  residential  mortgage  loans.  In
addition,  the Savings  Bank holds  investments  permitted  by federal  laws and
regulations  including  securities  issued by the U.S.  Government  and agencies
thereof.  The Savings Bank's revenues are derived  principally  from interest on
its mortgage loan and  mortgage-backed  securities  portfolios  and interest and
dividends on its investment securities.

Market Area and Competition

The Savings Bank is a community-oriented  savings institution offering a variety
of  financial  services  to meet the needs of the  communities  it  serves.  The
Savings Bank's deposit gathering and lending markets are primarily  concentrated
in the communities  surrounding its full service offices located in Lake, Sumter
and Citrus counties in central Florida. The Savings Bank's competition for loans
comes  principally from commercial  banks,  savings  institutions,  and mortgage
banking  companies.  The Savings Bank's most direct  competition for savings has
historically come from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions.
The Savings  Bank faces  additional  competition  for savings  from money market
mutual funds and other corporate and government  securities  funds.  The Savings
Bank  also  faces  increased  competition  for  deposits  from  other  financial
intermediaries such as securities brokerage firms and insurance companies.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
The Company's market risk arises primarily from  interest-rate  risk inherent in
its lending and deposit  taking  activities.  To that end,  management  actively
monitors and manages its interest-rate risk exposure.  The measurement of market
risk associated  with financial  instruments is meaningful only when all related
and offsetting on- and  off-balance-sheet  transactions are aggregated,  and the
resulting  net  positions are  identified.  Disclosures  about the fair value of
financial instruments,  which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's  primary objective is managing  interest-rate  risk is to minimize
the  adverse  impact of changes  in  interest  rates on the Bank's net  interest
income and capital, while adjusting the Company's  asset-liability  structure to
obtain the maximum  yield-cost  spread on that  structure.  The  Company  relies
primarily  on its  asset-liability  structure  to  control  interest-rate  risk.
However,  a sudden and  substantial  increase  in interest  rates may  adversely
impact the Company's  earnings,  to the extent that the interest  rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed,  to the same extent,  or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

Lending Activities

Loan  Portfolio.  The  Savings  Bank's  loan  portfolio  consists  primarily  of
conventional first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family  residences.  At
December  31,  1998,  the Savings  Bank's  total loans  outstanding  were $401.5
million,  of which  $283.4  million or 70.59% of the Savings  Bank's  total loan
portfolio  were  one-to-four-family  residential  first mortgage  loans.  Of the
one-to-four-family  residential  mortgage loans  outstanding at that date, 31.2%
were fixed rate loans and 68.8% were adjustable-rate  ("ARM") loans. At the same
date,  commercial  real estate  loans and other  loans on  improved  real estate
totaled $44.2  million,  or 11.01% of the Savings  Bank's total loan  portfolio;
construction  (excluding  construction/permanent  loans) and land loans  totaled
$11.7  million  or  2.91%  of the  Savings  Bank's  total  loan  portfolio;  and
multi-family  mortgage loans totaled $8.2 million or 2.04% of the Savings Bank's
total loan portfolio.  Consumer,  commercial and other loans held by the Savings
Bank,  which  principally  consist  of home  equity  loans,  deposit,  consumer,
commercial  and other  loans,  totaled  $54.0  million or 13.45% of the  Savings
Bank's total loan portfolio at December 31, 1998.

Purchase of Mortgage Loans.  The Savings Bank has, from time to time,  purchased
mortgage loans originated by other lenders.  At December 31, 1998, $2.5 million,
or .62% of the  Savings  Bank's  total loan  portfolio  consisted  of  purchased
mortgage  loans  or loan  participations.  Purchased  mortgage  loans  consisted
primarily of one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans.

Secondary  Market  Activities.  The Savings Bank  participates  in the secondary
market  through  a  correspondent  relationship,  originating  loans  (primarily
30-year  fixed-rate  loans)  which  are  funded by the  investor  correspondent.
Funding by the correspondent eliminates the Savings Bank's interest-rate risk on
such loans.  Such loans are closed on the Savings  Bank's  documents  with funds
provided by the investor  correspondent  at closing  with all credit  conditions
established by the investor  correspondent being satisfied prior to the issuance
of a  loan  commitment.  The  Savings  Bank  receives  a  fee  for  originating,
processing  and  closing  the  loans and  reports  the loans to the OTS as loans
originated and sold. In the year ended December 31, 1998, such loans amounted to
$8.4 million or 7.03% of total mortgage loans originated.

One-to-Four-Family Mortgage Lending. The Savings Bank's primary lending emphasis
is on the  origination  of first  mortgage  loans secured by  one-to-four-family
residences within its primary lending area. Such residences are primarily single
family homes,  including  condominium and townhouses,  that serve as the primary
residence  of the owner.  To a lesser  degree,  the Savings  Bank makes loans on
residences used as second homes or as investments.  The Savings Bank also offers
second mortgage loans which are underwritten  applying the same standards as for
first mortgage loans.

In the years ended  December 31, 1996,  1997 and 1998,  the Savings Bank's total
mortgage loan originations amounted to $74.4 million,  $118.5 million and $119.5
million, respectively, of which $62.9 million, $87.0 million and $107.4 million,
respectively, were secured by one-to-four-family properties.

At  December  31,  1998,   70.59%  of  total  loans   receivable   consisted  of
one-to-four-family residential loans, of which 68.8% were ARM loans. The Savings
Bank's ARM loans may carry an initial interest rate which is less than the fully
indexed rate for the loan.  The initial  discounted  rate is  determined  by the
Savings Bank in accordance with market and competitive factors. The Savings Bank
offers one-,  three- and five-year ARM loans which adjust by a maximum of 2% per
adjustment  period,  with lifetime caps on increases of 5% to 6%, depending upon
the program chosen.

The Savings  Bank's  policy on  one-to-four-family  residential  mortgage  loans
generally is to lend up to 80% of the appraised  value of property  securing the
loan,  or up to 95% if private  mortgage  insurance is obtained on the amount of
the loan which exceeds 80%.

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending.  As of December 31, 1998, $44.2
million,  or 11.01% of the Savings  Bank's  total loan  portfolio  consisted  of
commercial  real estate loans and $8.2 million,  or 2.04% of the Savings  Bank's
total loan portfolio, consisted of multi-family residential loans.

The  commercial  real estate loans in the Savings  Bank's  portfolio  consist of
fixed-rate and ARM loans which were originated at prevailing  market rates.  The
Savings  Bank's policy has been to originate  commercial or  multi-family  loans
only in its primary market area.  Commercial and multi-family  residential loans
are generally made in amounts up to 75% of the appraised  value of the property.
In making such loans,  the Savings Bank  primarily  considers  the net operating
income  generated by the real estate to support the debt service,  the financial
resources  and  income  level and  managerial  expertise  of the  borrower,  the
marketability of the property and the Savings Bank's lending experience with the
borrower.

Commercial Loans. As of December 31, 1998, $10.5 million or 2.62% of the Savings
Bank's total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans.

Construction  and Land Loans.  The Savings Bank originates  loans to finance the
construction  of  one-to-four-family   homes  and,  to  a  much  lesser  extent,
originates loans for the acquisition and development of land (either  unimproved
land or improved  lots) on which the purchaser  can then build.  At December 31,
1998,  construction  (excluding  construction/permanent  loans)  and land  loans
totaled $11.7 million or 2.91% of the Savings Bank's total loan portfolio.
<PAGE>
At December 31, 1998,  the Savings Bank had loans in process  (undisbursed  loan
proceeds  of  construction   loans)  of  $10.6  million  which  was  secured  by
residential mortgages.  The Savings Bank makes residential construction loans to
homeowners on a long-term basis with amortization beginning at the conclusion of
construction,  usually a period of about six  months.  Such loans are carried in
the   one-to-four-family   category  and  are  not   separately   classified  as
construction  loans.  Residential  construction loans to builders are carried in
the construction and land category.




                                        9
<PAGE>
Construction   and   land   loans   also   include    construction   loans   for
one-to-four-family  residential  property  for which the  borrower  will  obtain
permanent  financing  from  another  lender.  Such  loans  bear a fixed  rate of
interest that equals prime plus 2.0% during the construction period. The Savings
Bank  obtains a commitment  for the  permanent  financing  from the other lender
prior to originating the construction loan.

Consumer  Lending.  At December 31, 1998, $43.5 million or 10.83% of the Savings
Bank's total loan portfolio  consisted of consumer loans,  including home equity
loans and lines of credit for consumer  purposes and, to a lesser  extent,  home
improvement loans and secured and unsecured personal loans.

The Savings  Bank's  home  equity  loans are  originated  on  one-to-four-family
residences,  either on a  fixed-rate  basis with terms of up to 10 years or as a
balloon loan with terms up to five years with fifteen year amortization periods.
Those loans are generally limited to aggregate  outstanding  indebtedness on the
property  securing the loan of 80% of the loan to value ratio.  The Savings Bank
also offers  home  equity  lines of credit,  which bear  prime-based  adjustable
interest  rates with terms up to fifteen  years.  Such loans  generally  require
monthly payments of interest plus 1.5% of the balance outstanding.

Consumer loans are offered primarily on a fixed-rate,  short-term basis.  Except
for second  mortgage  loans which are  underwritten  pursuant  to the  standards
applicable to one-to-four-family  residential loans, the underwriting  standards
employed by the Savings Bank for consumer loans include a  determination  of the
applicant's  payment  history on other debts and an assessment of the borrower's
ability to make payments on the proposed loan and other indebtedness.

Loan  Approval  and  Authority.  Mortgage  loan  approval  authority  for  loans
exceeding  $1,000,000  has been  retained by the Board of Directors  which meets
weekly in its capacity as the Executive  Committee of the Board to consider loan
recommendations of the Loan Committee.  The Loan Committee is comprised of three
outside directors,  the President and the Senior Lending Officers of the Savings
Bank and has been delegated  authority to approve  mortgage  loans,  home equity
loans, home equity lines of credit and secured consumer loans up to $1,000,000.

The Savings  Bank's policy is to require title and hazard  insurance on all real
estate loans,  except home equity loans for which a title search is conducted in
lieu of obtaining title insurance. Borrowers may be permitted to pay real estate
taxes and hazard  insurance  premiums  applicable to the secured  property for a
mortgage  loan.  In some  instances,  borrowers may be required to advance funds
together  with each  payment of  principal  and  interest  to a mortgage  escrow
account from which the Savings Bank makes  disbursements  for items such as real
estate taxes, hazard insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums.

Asset Quality

Delinquent  Loans  and  Nonperforming  Assets.  Loans  are  generally  placed on
nonaccrual  status when the  collection  of  principal or interest is 90 days or
more past due, or earlier if  collection is deemed  uncertain.  The Savings Bank
provides  an  allowance  for  accrued  interest  deemed  uncollectible.  Accrued
interest  receivable is reported net of the allowance for uncollected  interest.
Loans may be reinstated to accrual status when all payments are brought  current
and, in the opinion of  management,  collection of the remaining  balance can be
reasonably expected.

At  December  31,  1998,  the  Savings  Bank had no  accruing  loans  which were
contractually  past  due 90 days or more as to  principal  and  interest  and no
troubled  debt  restructurings  as defined by Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 15.  Nonaccrual  loans for which interest has been reduced totaled
approximately  $444,000,  $242,000 and  $666,000 at December 31, 1998,  1997 and
1996,  respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 1998, interest income that
would  have  been  recorded  under the  original  terms of  nonaccrual  loans at
December 31, 1998 and interest income actually recognized is summarized below:

     Interest income that would have been recorded                $ 39,950

Classified Assets. Federal regulations and the Savings Bank's policy require the
classification  of loans and other assets,  such as debt and equity  securities,
considered  to be of  lesser  quality  as  "substandard",  "doubtful"  or "loss"
assets. An asset is considered  "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by
the  current net worth and paying  capacity of the obligor or of the  collateral
pledged,  if  any.  "Substandard"  assets  include  those  characterized  by the
"distinct  possibility"  that the  institution  will sustain  "some loss" if the
deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the
weaknesses   inherent  in  those  classified   "substandard,"   with  the  added
characteristic  that the weaknesses  present make  "collection or liquidation in
full", on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, "highly
<PAGE>
questionable and improbable."  Assets  classified as "loss" are those considered
"uncollectible"  and of such  little  value  that  their  continuance  as assets
without  the  establishment  of a specific  loss  reserve is not  warranted.  In
addition, the Savings Bank's policies require that assets which do not currently
expose the insured  institution to sufficient risk to warrant  classification as
substandard  but possess other  weaknesses are designated  "special  mention" by
management.

                                       12
<PAGE>
If an asset is  classified,  the estimated fair value of the asset is determined
and if that  value is less  than  the then  carrying  value  of the  asset,  the
difference is  established as a specific  reserve.  If an asset is classified as
loss, the amount of the asset  classified as loss is reserved.  General reserves
or  general  valuation  allowances  represent  loss  allowances  which have been
established to recognize the inherent risk  associated  with lending  activities
but, unlike specific reserves, are not allocated to particular assets.

The  following  table sets forth  information  concerning  the number and dollar
amount of loans  and real  estate  owned  classified  as  "special  mention"  or
"substandard"  at the  dates  indicated.  No loans  or real  estate  owned  were
classified ""doubtful" or "loss" at those dates.

Allowance  for Loan  Losses.  The Savings  Bank's  allowance  for loan losses is
established  and  maintained  through  a  provision  for  loan  losses  based on
management's  evaluation  of the risk  inherent  in its loan  portfolio  and the
condition  of the  local  economy  in  the  Savings  Bank's  market  area.  Such
evaluation,  which  includes a review of all loans on which full  collectibility
may not be reasonably  assured,  considers,  among other matters,  the estimated
fair value of the underlying collateral, economic and regulatory conditions, and
other  factors that warrant  recognition  in providing for an adequate loan loss
allowance.  Although management believes it uses the best information  available
to make  determinations  with respect to the Savings  Bank's  allowance for loan
losses,  future  adjustments  may  be  necessary  if  economic  conditions  vary
substantially from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the
initial determinations or if other circumstances change.

Investment Activities

The investment  policy of the Savings Bank, which is established by the Board of
Directors and  implemented by the Chief  Executive  Officer who is designated as
the Investment Officer, is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity,
to generate a favorable return on investments  without  incurring undue interest
rate and credit risk, and to complement  the Savings Bank's lending  activities.
In  establishing  its  investment  strategies,  the Savings Bank  considers  its
business and growth plans, the economic environment,  the types of securities to
be held and other factors.  Federally  chartered  savings  institutions have the
authority  to  invest  in  various  types of  assets,  including  U.S.  Treasury
obligations,  securities of various federal  agencies,  certain  certificates of
deposit of insured banks and savings institutions,  certain bankers acceptances,
repurchase  agreements,  loans on federal funds, and, subject to certain limits,
commercial paper and mutual funds.

On January 1, 1994,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 115.  That  statement  requires  investment  and  mortgage-backed
securities  that the  Company  has the  positive  intent and  ability to hold to
maturity  to be  classified  as  held-to-maturity  securities  and  reported  at
amortized  cost.  Securities  that are held  principally for selling in the near
term are to be classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with
unrealized  gains and losses included in earnings.  Securities not classified as
either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are to be classified as
available-for-sale  securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported in a separate  component  of
stockholders' equity.

Mortgage-Backed Securities

The Savings Bank invests in  collateralized  mortgage  obligations  ("CMOs") and
mortgage-backed  securities  such as government  pass-through  certificates.  At
December 31,  1998,  the Savings  Bank's  mortgage-backed  securities  portfolio
totaled $24.8 million, or 5.3% of total assets. The  mortgage-backed  securities
are not due at a single  maturity date, and  accordingly,  contractual  maturity
information  is  not  presented  herein.  CMOs,  net  of  related  premiums  and
discounts, totaled $4.7 million or 18.9% of total mortgage-backed securities.

CMOs are typically issued by a special purpose entity, which may be organized in
any  of  a  variety  of  legal  forms,  such  as a  trust,  a  corporation  or a
partnership.  The entity  combines pools of pass-through  securities,  which are
used to collateralize the mortgage related securities.  Once combined,  the cash
flows can be divided into  different  "tranches"  or  "classes"  of  securities,
thereby creating more predictable average lives for each tranch or class than is
provided  by the  underlying  pass-through  pools.  Under  this  structure,  all
principal  repayments  from the various  mortgage  pools can be  allocated  to a
mortgage-related  securities class or classes  structured to have priority until
it has been paid off.  Thus,  these  securities  are  designed  to  address  the
reinvestment  concerns associated with mortgage-backed  security  pass-throughs,
namely that they tend to pay off more  rapidly  when  interest  rates fall.  The
Savings  Bank's CMOs have  coupon  rates  ranging  from 5.30% to 7.53% and had a
weighted average yield of 6.35% at December 31, 1998.
<PAGE>
The Savings  Bank's  policy is to purchase CMOs rated AA or better by nationally
recognized  rating services.  The majority of the CMOs owned by the Savings Bank
are insured or guaranteed either directly or indirectly, through mortgage-backed
securities underlying the obligations issued by the .

At December  31, 1998,  the Savings  Bank had $4.7 million in CMOs  representing
1.0% of total assets.  Of that amount,  $4.2 million or 89.6% had floating rates
with caps  ranging  from  8.50% to 12.65%  and which  adjust on a monthly  basis
Government  National  Mortgage  Association  ("GNMA"),  the  Federal  Home  Loan
Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") and the Federal National Mortgage
Association ("FNMA").


                                       16
<PAGE>
Other mortgage-backed  securities,  net, totaled $20.1 million or 81.1% of total
mortgage-backed   securities.   Other  mortgage-backed   securities  consist  of
pass-through certificates issued by the FNMA, FHLMC or GNMA.

At December 31, 1998, the Savings Bank had mortgage-backed  securities available
for sale with an aggregate  carrying  value of $8.9 million and  mortgage-backed
securities classified as held to maturity of $15.9 million,  consisting of CMOs,
FHLMC certificates, GNMA certificates and FNMA certificates.

amortization and repayments during the periods indicated:

Sources of Funds

General. Repayments and maturities of mortgage-backed and investment securities,
loan  repayments,  deposits and cash flows  generated  from  operations  are the
primary  sources of the Savings  Bank's funds for use in lending,  investing and
for other general purposes.

Deposits.  The Savings Bank offers a variety of deposit  accounts having a range
of interest  rates and terms.  The Savings  Bank's  deposits  consist of regular
savings,   non-interest-bearing   checking,  NOW  checking,   money  market  and
certificate  accounts.  Of the  deposit  accounts at December  31,  1998,  $29.7
million or 8.4% consist of individual retirement accounts ("IRAs").

The  Savings  Bank seeks to retain core  deposits  consisting  of  passbook  and
statement savings, money market, noninterest-bearing checking, and NOW accounts,
which contributed to a low cost of funds. Such core deposits  represented 25.0%,
23.8%  and  26.2% of total  deposits  at  December  31,  1996,  1997,  and 1998,
respectively.

Borrowings

The Savings Bank is  authorized  to obtain  advances  from the Federal Home Loan
Bank ("FHLB") of Atlanta which are  generally  collateralized  by a blanket lien
against  the  Savings  Bank's  mortgage  portfolio.  Such  advances  may be made
pursuant  to  several  different  credit  programs,  each of  which  has its own
interest  rate and range of  maturities.  The  maximum  amount  that the FHLB of
Atlanta will advance to member  institutions,  including the Savings  Bank,  for
purposes  other  than  meeting  withdrawals,  fluctuates  from  time  to time in
accordance  with the policies of the Federal  Housing Finance Board and the FHLB
of  Atlanta.  At December  31,  1998,  the Savings  Bank had $56 million in FHLB
advances outstanding.

From time to time,  the  Savings  Bank enters into  agreements  with  nationally
recognized  primary  securities  dealers  under  which the  Savings  Bank  sells
securities subject to repurchase  agreements.  Such agreements are accounted for
as  borrowings  by the Savings Bank and are secured by the  securities  sold. At
December  31,  1998,  the  Savings  Bank  did  not  have  any  such   borrowings
outstanding.  During  1998,  the  Savings  Bank  began  borrowing  under  retail
repurchase  agreements with customers of the Savings Bank.  These agreements are
also  accounted  for as borrowings  and are secured by  securities  owned by the
Bank.

The  following  table sets forth  certain  information  relating  to the Savings
Bank's borrowings at the dates indicated:

Subsidiary Activities

The  Savings  Bank  has  one  wholly-owned   subsidiary,   Lake  County  Service
Corporation.  Lake County  Service  Corporation  was formed to develop a 100-lot
subdivision and is now substantially inactive, having sold all but one lot. Lake
County Service  Corporation  also owns an 8.4 acre  commercial  parcel and a one
acre lot adjoining the Savings Bank's main office.

Personnel

As of February 22, 1999,  the Savings Bank had 149  full-time  employees  and 14
part-time  employees.   The  employees  are  not  represented  by  a  collective
bargaining  unit  and the  Savings  Bank  considers  its  relationship  with its
employees to be good.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

General

The Company,  as a savings and loan holding company, is required to file certain
reports with, and otherwise  comply with the rules and regulations of the Office
of Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS") under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended (the
"HOLA").  In  addition,  the  activities  of savings  institutions,  such as the
Savings  Bank,  are governed by the HOLA and the Federal  Deposit  Insurance Act
("FDI Act").

The Savings Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision
by the OTS,  as its  primary  federal  regulator,  and the FDIC,  as the deposit
insurer.  The Savings  Bank is a member of FHLB System and its deposit  accounts
are insured up to applicable  limits by the Savings  Association  Insurance Fund
("SAIF")  managed by the FDIC.  The Savings  Bank must file reports with the OTS
and the FDIC  concerning its  activities and financial  condition in addition to
obtaining  regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such
as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other savings institutions.  The OTS and/or
the FDIC conduct  periodic  examinations  to test the Savings  Bank's safety and
soundness and compliance with various regulatory  requirements.  This regulation
and supervision  establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an
institution  can engage and is  intended  primarily  for the  protection  of the
insurance  fund  and  depositors.   The  regulatory  structure  also  gives  the
regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory
and enforcement  activities and examination  policies,  including  policies with
respect to the  classification  of assets and the establishment of adequate loan
loss  reserves  for  regulatory   purposes.   Any  change  in  such   regulatory
requirements and policies,  whether by the OTS, the FDIC or the Congress,  could
have a  material  adverse  impact on the  Company,  the  Savings  Bank and their
operations.  Certain of the  regulatory  requirements  applicable to the Savings
Bank  and to the  Company  are  referred  to  below  or  elsewhere  herein.  The
description  of  statutory  provisions  and  regulations  applicable  to savings
institutions  and their  holding  companies set forth in this Form 10-K does not
purport to be a complete  description of such statutes and regulations and their
effects on the Savings Bank and the Company.

Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a nondiversified  unitary savings and loan holding company within
the meaning of the HOLA.  As a unitary  savings and loan  holding  company,  the
Company  generally  is not  restricted  under  existing  laws as to the types of
business  activities  in which it may engage,  provided  that the  Savings  Bank
continues  to  be a  qualified  thrift  lender  ("QTL").  See  "Federal  Savings
Institution Regulation - QTL Test." Upon any non-supervisory  acquisition by the
Company of another  savings  institution or savings bank that meets the QTL test
<PAGE>
and is deemed to be a savings institution by the OTS, the Company would become a
multiple  savings and loan holding company (if the acquired  institution is held
as a separate  subsidiary) and would be subject to extensive  limitations on the
types of  business  activities  in which it could  engage.  The HOLA  limits the
activities of a multiple  savings and loan holding  company and its  non-insured
institution  subsidiaries  primarily to activities  permissible for bank holding
companies  under  Section  4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding  Company Act ("BHC Act"),
subject to the prior approval of the OTS, and certain  activities  authorized by
OTS  regulation,  and no multiple  savings and loan holding  company may acquire
more than 5% the voting stock of a company engaged in impermissible activities.



                                       24
<PAGE>
The HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding  company,  directly or indirectly,
or through one or more  subsidiaries,  from acquiring more than 5% of the voting
stock of another savings  institution or holding company thereof,  without prior
written  approval of the OTS or acquiring  or retaining  control of a depository
institution  that is not  insured by the FDIC.  In  evaluating  applications  by
holding  companies to acquire  savings  institutions,  the OTS must consider the
financial  and  managerial  resources  and future  prospects  of the company and
institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance
funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.

The OTS is  prohibited  from  approving any  acquisition  that would result in a
multiple savings and loan holding company  controlling  savings  institutions in
more than one state,  subject to two exceptions:  (i) the approval of interstate
supervisory  acquisitions  by savings and loan  holding  companies  and (ii) the
acquisition  of a savings  institution in another state if the laws of the state
of the target savings  institution  specifically  permit such acquisitions.  The
states  vary in the  extent to which they  permit  interstate  savings  and loan
holding company acquisitions.

Although savings and loan holding  companies are not subject to specific capital
requirements  or  specific  restrictions  on the payment of  dividends  or other
capital  distributions,  HOLA does  prescribe  such  restrictions  on subsidiary
savings  institutions as described  below.  The Savings Bank must notify the OTS
thirty days before  declaring  any  dividend to the Company.  In  addition,  the
financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary  institution is a matter
that is evaluated by the OTS and the agency has authority to order  cessation of
activities or divestiture of subsidiaries  deemed to pose a threat to the safety
and soundness of the institution.

Federal Savings Institution Regulation

Business Activities. The activities of federal savings institutions are governed
by federal law and regulations.  These laws and regulations delineate the nature
and extent of the  activities  in which  federal  associations  may  engage.  In
particular,  many types of lending  authority  for  federal  association,  e.g.,
commercial,  nonresidential  real property loans and consumer loans, are limited
to a specified percentage of the institution's capital or assets.

Capital  Requirements.  The OTS capital regulations require savings institutions
to meet three minimum  capital  standards:  a 1.5% tangible  capital ratio, a 3%
leverage  (core) capital ratio and an 8% risk-based  capital ratio. In addition,
the prompt  corrective  action  standards  discussed  below also  establish,  in
effect,  a minimum 2% tangible  capital  standard,  a 4% leverage (core) capital
ratio (3% for institutions  receiving the highest rating on the CAMELS financial
institution  rating system),  and, together with the risk-based capital standard
itself,  a 4% Tier I  risk-based  capital  standard.  Core capital is defined as
common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock and related surplus,  and minority interests in equity
accounts  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  less  intangibles  other than  certain
mortgage  servicing  rights and credit card  relationships.  The OTS regulations
also require  that,  in meeting the  tangible,  leverage  (core) and  risk-based
capital  standards,  institutions must generally deduct investments in and loans
to subsidiaries  engaged in activities as principal that are not permissible for
a national bank.
<PAGE>
The  risk-based   capital  standard  for  savings   institutions   requires  the
maintenance of Tier I (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital
and  supplementary  capital)  to  risk-weighted  assets  of at  least 4% and 8%,
respectively.  In determining the amount of  risk-weighted  assets,  all assets,
including  certain  off-balance  sheet assets,  are  multiplied by a risk-weight
factor of 0% to 100%,  as assigned by the OTS  capital  regulation  based on the
risks OTS believes are inherent in the type of asset.  The  components of Tier I
(core)  capital are  equivalent to those  discussed  earlier.  The components of
supplementary  capital currently include cumulative  preferred stock,  long-term
perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible  securities,  subordinated debt
and  intermediate  preferred  stock and the  allowance for loan and lease losses
limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted  assets.  Overall,  the amount of
supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot

                                       25
<PAGE>
exceed 100% of core capital.

The OTS regulatory  capital  requirements also incorporate an interest rate risk
component.  Savings institutions with "above normal" interest rate risk exposure
are subject to a deduction from total capital for purposes of calculating  their
risk-based capital requirements.  A savings institution's  interest rate risk is
measured  by the decline in the net  portfolio  value of its assets  (i.e.,  the
difference  between  incoming  and outgoing  discounted  cash flows from assets,
liabilities  and  off-balance   sheet   contracts)  that  would  result  from  a
hypothetical  200 basis point  increase or  decrease  in market  interest  rates
divided  by the  estimated  economic  value  of  the  institution's  assets.  In
calculating  its total  capital  under the  risk-based  capital  rule, a savings
institution whose measured interest rate risk exposure exceeds 2% must deduct an
amount equal to one-half of the difference  between the  institution's  measured
interest rate risk and 2%,  multiplied by the  estimated  economic  value of the
institution's  assets.  The  Director  of the OTS may  waive or defer a  savings
institution's  interest rate risk component on a  case-by-case  basis. A savings
institution with assets of less than $300 million and risk-based  capital ratios
in excess of 12% is not subject to the interest rate risk component,  unless the
OTS  determines   otherwise.   For  the  present  time,  the  OTS  has  deferred
implementation  of the interest rate risk  component.  At December 31, 1998, the
Savings Bank met each of its capital requirements and it is anticipated that the
Savings Bank will not be subject to the interest rate risk component.

The following table presents the Savings Bank's capital position at December 31,
1998.

Prompt  Corrective  Regulatory  Action.  The OTS is  required  to  take  certain
supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which
depends  upon the  institution's  degree of  undercapitalization.  Generally,  a
savings institution that has a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of
less than 8%, a ratio of Tier 1 (core) capital to  risk-weighted  assets of less
than 4% or a ratio of core  capital to total  assets of less than 4% (3% or less
for  institutions  with the  highest  examination  rating) is  considered  to be
"undercapitalized."  A savings  institution that has a total risk-based  capital
ratio less than 6%, a Tier 1 capital  ratio of less than 3% or a leverage  ratio
that is less than 3% is considered to be "significantly  undercapitalized" and a
savings  institution  that has a tangible  capital to assets ratio equal to less
than 2% is  deemed  to be  "critically  undercapitalized."  Subject  to a narrow
<PAGE>
exception,  the OTS is  required  to appoint a receiver  or  conservator  for an
institution that is "critically  undercapitalized." The regulation also provides
that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OTS within 45 days of the
date a  savings  institution  receives  notice  that  it is  "undercapitalized,"
"significantly  undercapitalized" or "critically  undercapitalized."  Compliance
with the plan must be guaranteed  by any parent  holding  company.  In addition,
numerous  mandatory  supervisory  actions  become  immediately  applicable to an
undercapitalized   institution,   including,   but  not  limited  to,  increased
monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth,  capital  distributions and
expansion.  The OTS  could  also  take  any  one of a  number  of  discretionary
supervisory  actions,  including  the  issuance of a capital  directive  and the
replacement of senior executive officers and directors.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Deposits of the Bank are presently insured by the
SAIF. The FDIC maintains a risk-based  assessment  system by which  institutions
are assigned to one of three categories based on their capitalization and one of
three subcategories based on examination ratings and other

                                       26
<PAGE>
supervisory  information.  An  institution's  assessment  rate  depends upon the
categories  to  which  it  is  assigned.   Assessment   rates  for  SAIF  member
institutions  are determined  semiannually  by the FDIC and currently range from
zero basis  points for the  healthiest  institutions  to 27 basis points for the
riskiest.

In addition to the assessment for deposit  insurance,  institutions are required
to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing  Corporation
("FICO") to recapitalize the predecessor to the SAIF. During 1998, FICO payments
for SAIF members  approximated  6.10 basis  points,  while Bank  Insurance  Fund
("BIF")  members paid 1.22 basis points.  By law, there will be equal sharing of
FICO payments  between SAIF and BIF members on the earlier of January 1, 2000 or
the date the SAIF and BIF are merged.

The Bank paid no  assessment  for 1998;  however,  its payments  toward the FICO
bonds  amounted  to  $194,760.  The FDIC has  authority  to  increase  insurance
assessments. A significant increase in SAIF insurance premiums would likely have
an adverse  effect on the  operating  expenses and results of  operations of the
Bank.  Management cannot predict what insurance  assessment rates will be in the
future.

Insurance  of deposits  may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a finding  that the
institution  has  engaged  in unsafe or  unsound  practices,  is in an unsafe or
unsound  condition to continue  operations or has violated any  applicable  law,
regulation,  rule,  order or  condition  imposed  by the  FDIC or the  OTS.  The
management  of the Bank does not know of any  practice,  condition  or violation
that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

Thrift Rechartering  Legislation.  Legislation enacted in 1996 provided that the
BIF and SAIF  were to have  merged  on  January  1,  1999 if there  were no more
savings associations as of that date. Various proposals to eliminate the federal
savings association charter,  create a uniform financial  institutions  charter,
abolish the OTS and restrict  savings and loan holding  company  activities have
been  introduced  in  Congress.  The Bank is  unable  to  predict  whether  such
legislation  will be  enacted  or the  extent  to which  the  legislation  would
restrict or disrupt its operations.

Loans to One  Borrower.  Under  the HOLA,  savings  institutions  are  generally
subject to the limits on loans to one  borrower  applicable  to national  banks.
Generally, savings institutions may not make a loan or extend credit to a single
or related  group of  borrowers in excess of 15% of its  unimpaired  capital and
surplus.  An additional  amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired  capital
and surplus, if such loan is secured by readily-marketable  collateral, which is
defined to include certain  financial  instruments and bullion.  At December 31,
1998,  the Savings  Bank's limit on loans to one borrower was $7.2  million.  At
December 31, 1998, the Savings Bank's largest aggregate  outstanding  balance of
loans to one borrower was $4.9 million.
<PAGE>
QTL Test. The HOLA requires  savings  institutions to meet a QTL test. Under the
QTL test,  a savings and loan  association  must  either  qualify as a "domestic
building  and loan  association"  as defined  in the  Internal  Revenue  Code or
maintain  at  least  65% of its  "portfolio  assets"  (total  assets  less:  (i)
specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets;  (ii) intangibles,  including
goodwill;  and (iii) the value of property used to conduct  business) in certain
"qualified  thrift  investments"  (primarily  residential  mortgages and related
investments,  including certain mortgage-backed securities) in at least 9 months
out of each 12 month period.

A savings  institution  that fails the QTL test is subject to certain  operating
restrictions  and may be required to convert to a bank  charter.  As of December
31, 1998, the Savings Bank maintained 83.3% of its portfolio assets in qualified
thrift  investments and,  therefore,  met the QTL test.  Recent  legislation has
expanded  the  extent to which  education  loans,  credit  card  loans and small
business loans may be considered "qualified thrift investments."

Limitation on Capital Distributions. OTS regulations impose limitations upon all
capital distributions

                                       27
<PAGE>
by a savings institution,  including cash dividends,  payments to repurchase its
shares and payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger.
The  rule  effective  in 1998  established  three  tiers of  institutions  based
primarily on an  institution's  capital level. An institution  that exceeded all
capital  requirements before and after a proposed capital  distribution ("Tier 1
Bank")  and had not been  advised  by the OTS  that it was in need of more  than
normal supervision,  could, after prior notice but without obtaining approval of
the OTS,  make  capital  distributions  during  the  calendar  year equal to the
greater of (i) 100% of its net  earnings to date during the  calendar  year plus
the amount that would  reduce by one-half  the excess  capital  over its capital
requirements at the beginning of the calendar year or (ii) 75% of its net income
for the previous four quarters.  Any additional capital  distributions  required
prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 1998, the Bank was a Tier 1 Bank.

Effective April 1, 1999, the OTS's capital distribution  regulation will change.
Under the new  regulation,  an  application to and the prior approval of the OTS
will be required prior to any capital  distribution if the institution  does not
meet  the  criteria  for  "expedited   treatment"  of  applications   under  OTS
regulations (i.e.,  generally,  examination  ratings in the two top categories),
the total capital distributions for the calendar year exceed net income for that
year plus the amount of retained  net income for the  preceding  two years,  the
institution  would  be  undercapitalized   following  the  distribution  or  the
distribution  would otherwise be contrary to a statute,  regulation or agreement
with OTS. If an application is not required,  the institution must still provide
prior notice to OTS of the capital distribution. In the event the Bank's capital
fell below its  regulatory  requirements  or the OTS  notified it that it was in
need of more  than  normal  supervision,  the  Bank's  ability  to make  capital
distributions  could be  restricted.  In  addition,  the OTS  could  prohibit  a
proposed  capital  distribution  by an  institution,  which would  otherwise  be
permitted by the regulation,  if the OTS determines that such distribution would
constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

Liquidity.  The Savings Bank is required to maintain an average daily balance of
specified  liquid assets equal to a monthly average of not less than a specified
percentage of its net withdrawable deposit accounts plus short-term  borrowings.
This liquidity requirement was 4% for fiscal 1998, but is subject to change from
time to time by the OTS to any amount  within  the range of 4% to 10%  depending
upon economic conditions and the savings flows of member institutions.  Monetary
penalties may be imposed for failure to meet these liquidity  requirements.  The
Savings Bank's  liquidity  ratio for December 31, 1998 was 8.8%,  which exceeded
the applicable requirement.  The Savings Bank has never been subject to monetary
penalties for failure to meet its liquidity requirement.

Branching.  OTS regulations permit nationwide  branching by federally  chartered
savings  institutions  to the extent  allowed by federal  statute.  This permits
federal   savings   institutions  to  establish   interstate   networks  and  to
geographically  diversify their loan  portfolios and lines of business.  The OTS
authority  preempts any state law  purporting  to regulate  branching by federal
savings institutions.

Transactions  with Related  Parties.  The Savings Bank's  authority to engage in
transactions  with  related  parties or  "affiliates"  (e.g..,  any company that
controls or is under common control with an  institution,  including the Company
and any non-savings institution subsidiaries) is limited by Sections 23A and 23B
of the Federal Reserve Act ("FRA").  Section 23A limits the aggregate  amount of
covered  transactions  with any  individual  affiliate to 10% of the capital and
<PAGE>
surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions
with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings  institution's  capital and
surplus.  Certain  transactions  with  affiliates  are required to be secured by
collateral in an amount and of a type  described in Section 23A and the purchase
of low quality  assets from  affiliates  is  generally  prohibited.  Section 23B
generally  provides that certain  transactions with affiliates,  including loans
and asset purchases, must be on terms and under circumstances,  including credit
standards,  that are  substantially  the same or at  least as  favorable  to the
institution  as those  prevailing at the time for comparable  transactions  with
non-affiliated companies. In addition,  savings institutions are prohibited from
lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities  that are not permissible
for  bank  holding  companies  and  no  savings  institution  may  purchase  the
securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.

                                       28
<PAGE>
The Savings Bank's authority to extend credit to executive  officers,  directors
and 10% shareholders ("insiders"),  as well as entities such persons control, is
governed by Sections  22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and  Regulation  O  thereunder.
Among other  things,  such loans are required to be made on terms  substantially
the same as those offered to  unaffiliated  individuals  and not to involve more
than the normal risk of repayment.  Recent legislation  created an exception for
loans  made  pursuant  to a  benefit  or  compensation  program  that is  widely
available to all employees of the  institution  and does not give  preference to
insiders over other employees. Regulation O also places individual and aggregate
limits on the amount of loans the Savings  Bank may make to insiders  based,  in
part, on the Savings Bank's capital position and requires certain board approval
procedures to be followed.

Enforcement.  Under the FDI Act, the OTS has primary enforcement  responsibility
over savings  institutions  and has the authority to bring  actions  against the
institution and all institution-affiliated  parties, including stockholders, and
any  attorneys,   appraisers  and   accountants   who  knowingly  or  recklessly
participate  in wrongful  action likely to have an adverse  effect on an insured
institution.  Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital
directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers  and/or  directors to
institution  of   receivership,   conservatorship   or  termination  of  deposit
insurance.  Civil  penalties  cover a wide range of violations and can amount to
$25,000 per day, or even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. Under
the FDI Act, the FDIC has the  authority to recommend to the Director of the OTS
enforcement action to be taken with respect to a particular savings institution.
If action  is not taken by the  Director,  the FDIC has  authority  to take such
action  under  certain  circumstances.  Federal  law also  establishes  criminal
penalties for certain violations.

Standards for Safety and Soundness.  The federal  banking  agencies have adopted
Interagency  Guidelines  Prescribing  Standards  for Safety and  Soundness.  The
guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking
agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions
before capital  becomes  impaired.  If the  appropriate  federal  banking agency
determines  that an  institution  fails to meet any standard  prescribed  by the
guidelines,  the agency may require the  institution  to submit to the agency an
acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.

Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve Board regulations  require savings  institutions to maintain
non-interest  earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW
and regular checking accounts).  The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally
required  for  most  of 1997  that  reserves  be  maintained  against  aggregate
transaction  accounts as follows: for accounts aggregating $46.5 million or less
(subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement was
3%; and for  accounts  aggregating  greater  than  $46.5  million,  the  reserve
requirement  was $1.395  million plus 10% (subject to  adjustment by the Federal
Reserve  Board  between 8% and 14%) against  that  portion of total  transaction
accounts  in excess  of $46.5  million.  The first  $4.9  million  of  otherwise
reservable  balances  (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) were
exempted from the reserve  requirements.  The Savings Bank is in compliance with
the foregoing requirements.
<PAGE>
Year 2000

The  Company  is  acutely  aware of the many  areas  affected  by the Year  2000
computer issue, as addressed by the Federal Financial  Institutions  Examination
Council  ("FFIEC") in its  interagency  statement  which provided an outline for
institutions  to manage the Year 2000 challenges  effectively.  A Year 2000 plan
has been  approved by the Board of Directors  which  includes  multiple  phases,
tasks to be completed, and target dates for completion.  Issues addressed in the
plan include  awareness,  assessment,  renovation,  validation,  implementation,
testing, and contingency planning.

The Company has formed a Year 2000  committee that is charged with the oversight
of completing the Year 2000 project on a timely basis. The Company has completed
its awareness, assessment and

                                       29
<PAGE>
renovation  phases and is actively  involved in validating and  implementing its
plan. At the present time, the Company has  substantially  completed its testing
phase, the results of which indicate that the Company's  internal systems appear
to be Year 2000 ready. Since it routinely upgrades and purchases technologically
advanced  software and hardware on a continual basis, the Company has determined
that the cost of making  modifications  to correct any Year 2000 issues will not
materially affect reported operating  results.  Management does not believe that
the Company has incurred or will incur material costs  associated  with the Year
2000 issue.

The Company's vendors and suppliers have been contacted for written confirmation
of their  product  readiness  for Year 2000  compliance.  Negative or  deficient
responses are analyzed and  periodically  reviewed to prescribe  timely  actions
within the Company's contingency  planning.  The Company's main service provider
has  completed  testing of its mission  critical  application  software and item
processing software; the test results, which have been documented and validated,
are  deemed to be Year 2000  compliant.  FFIEC  guidance  on  testing  Year 2000
compliance  of  service   providers  states  that  proxy  tests  are  acceptable
compliance  tests.  In  proxy  testing,   the  service  provider  tests  with  a
representative  sample of financial  institutions that use a particular service,
with the results of such testing shared with all similarly  situated  clients of
the service provider. The Company has authorized the acceptance of proxy testing
since the proxy tests have been conducted with financial  institutions  that are
similar  in type and  complexity  to its own using the same  version of the Year
2000 ready software and the same hardware and operating systems.

The Company also recognizes the importance of determining that its borrowers are
facing the Year 2000 problem in a timely  manner to avoid  deterioration  of the
loan portfolio  solely due to this issue. All material  relationships  have been
identified and questionnaires  have been completed to assess the inherent risks.
Deposit customers have received statement stuffers and informational material in
this regard.  The Company plans to work on a one-on-one  basis with any borrower
who has been identified as having high Year 2000 risk exposure.

Notwithstanding  our actions,  there can be no assurances  that all hardware and
software  that the  Company  will use will be Year  2000  compliant.  Management
cannot  predict  the  amount  of  financial  difficulties  it may  incur  due to
customers and vendors  inability to perform  according to their  agreements with
the  Company or the effects  that other  third  parties may cause as a result of
this issue.  Therefore,  there can be no assurance  that the failure or delay of
others to address the issue or that the costs  involved in such process will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,  financial  condition,
and results of operations.

Based on  testing  results  to date (as  noted  above),  the  Company's  mission
critical  systems  have been  deemed to be Year 2000 ready.  However,  a written
contingency  plan has been  developed to address  problems  that might be caused
from Year 2000 system  failures.  Testing of the contingency plan is in progress
and is scheduled to be  completed by June 30, 1999.  With regard to  non-mission
critical internal systems, the Company's  contingency plans are to replace those
systems that test as being  noncompliant.  Alternatively,  some systems could be
handled  manually on an interim basis.  Should outside service  providers not be
able  to  provide   compliant   systems,   the  Company  will  terminate   those
relationships  and  transfer  to  other  vendors.  It is  anticipated  that  the
Company's  deposit  customers will have increased demands for cash in the latter
part of 1999 and,  correspondingly,  the Company will maintain higher  liquidity
levels.

                           FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION

Federal Taxation

General.  The Company and the Savings Bank report their income on a consolidated
basis using the accrual method of accounting,  and are subject to federal income
taxation  in the  same  manner  as  other  corporations  with  some  exceptions,
including particularly the Savings Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed below.
The  following  discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does
not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the
Savings  Bank or the  Company.  The Savings Bank was last audited by the IRS for
the year ended December 31, 1996. For its 1998 taxable year, the Savings Bank is
subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of 34%.

Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning prior to December 31, 1995, thrift
institutions  which  qualified  under  certain   definitional  tests  and  other
conditions of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") were  permitted to
use certain  favorable  provisions to calculate  their  deductions  from taxable
income  for  annual  additions  to their bad debt  reserve.  A reserve  could be
established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans  (generally  secured
by  interests  in  real  property  improved  or to be  improved)  under  (i) the
Percentage of Taxable  Income  Method (the "PTI Method") or (ii) the  Experience
Method.  The reserve for  nonqualifying  loans was computed using the Experience
Method.

The Small  Business  Job  Protection  Act of 1996 (the  "1996  Act"),  which was
enacted on August 20, 1996,  requires  savings  institutions to recapture (i.e.,
take into income) certain portions of their  accumulated bad debt reserves.  The
1996 Act repeals the reserve  method of accounting  for bad debts  effective for
tax years beginning  after 1995.  Thrift  institutions  that would be treated as
small banks are  allowed to utilize the  Experience  Method  applicable  to such
institutions,  while thrift  institutions that are treated as large banks (those
generally  exceeding  $500  million  in  assets)  are  required  to use only the
specific charge-off method.  Thus, the PTI Method of accounting for bad debts is
no longer available for any financial institution.

A thrift institution required to change its method of computing reserves for bad
debts will treat such change as a change in method of  accounting,  initiated by
the  taxpayer,  and having  been made with the  consent of the IRS.  Any Section
481(a)  adjustment  required to be taken into income with respect to such change
generally  will be taken into income  ratably  over a  six-taxable  year period,
beginning  with the first  taxable  year  beginning  after 1995,  subject to the
residential loan requirement.

Under the residential loan requirement provision,  the recapture required by the
1996 Act is suspended for each of two successive  taxable years,  beginning with
1996,  in which the Savings  Bank  originates  a minimum of certain  residential
loans based upon the average of the principal  amounts of such loans made by the
Savings Bank during its six taxable years  preceding  its current  taxable year.
Under the 1996 Act, for its current and future taxable  years,  the Savings Bank
is permitted to make  additions to its tax bad debt reserves.  In addition,  the
Savings Bank is required to recapture  (i.e.,  take into income) over a six year
period the excess of the balance of its tax bad debt reserves as of December 31,
1995 over the balance of such  reserves as of December 31, 1987. At December 31,
1998, the Savings Bank had  approximately  $757,000 of deferred tax  liabilities
recorded for the recapture of its bad debt reserves.
<PAGE>
Distributions.  Under the 1996 Act,  if the  Savings  Bank  makes  "non-dividend
distributions"  to the Company,  such  distributions  will be considered to have
been made from the Savings Bank's  unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves (including
the balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987) to the extent thereof,  and
then from the Savings Bank's  supplemental  reserve for losses on loans,  to the
extent thereof, and an amount based on the amount distributed (but not in excess
of the amount of such  reserves)  will be included in the Savings Bank's income.
Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Savings Bank's
current and accumulated  earnings and profits,  as calculated for federal income
tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial
or complete  liquidation.  Dividends  paid out of the Savings  Bank's current or
accumulated

                                       31
<PAGE>
earnings and profits will not be so included in the Savings Bank's income.

The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount
that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount
of the distribution. Thus, if the Savings Bank makes a non-dividend distribution
to the  Company,  approximately  one  and  one-half  times  the  amount  of such
distribution  (but  not in  excess  of the  amount  of such  reserves)  would be
includable  in income for federal  income tax  purposes,  assuming a 35% federal
corporate  income tax rate.  The Savings  Bank does not intend to pay  dividends
that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.

SAIF Recapitalization  Assessment. The Funds Act levied a 65.7 cent fee on every
$100 of  thrift  deposits  held on  March  31,  1995.  For  financial  statement
purposes,  this  assessment  was  reported as an expense  for the quarter  ended
September  30, 1996.  The Funds Act  included a provision  which stated that the
amount of any special  assessment paid to capitalize SAIF under this legislation
was deductible under Section 162 of the Code in the year of payment.

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. The Code imposes a tax on alternative minimum
taxable income  ("AMTI") at a rate of 20%. For fiscal years  beginning  prior to
January  1,  1996,  the  excess  of the bad debt  reserve  deduction  using  the
percentage  of taxable  income  method over the  deduction  that would have been
allowable  under the  experience  method is  treated  as a  preference  item for
purposes of computing the AMTI.  Only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating
loss carryovers.  The adjustment to AMTI based on book income is an amount equal
to 75% of the amount by which a corporation's  adjusted current earnings exceeds
its AMTI  (determined  without regard to this  adjustment and prior to reduction
for net  operating  losses).  In addition,  for taxable  years  through 1995, an
environmental  tax of .12% of the  excess of AMTI (with  certain  modifications)
over $2.0  million is imposed  on  corporations,  including  the  Savings  Bank,
whether or not an Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT") is paid. The Savings Bank does
not expect to be subject to the AMT.

Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters. The Company may exclude from its
income 100% of dividends  received from the Savings Bank as a member of the same
affiliated group of corporations.  The corporate dividends received deduction is
generally 70% in the case of dividends  received from unaffiliated  corporations
with which the  Company and the Savings  Bank will not file a  consolidated  tax
return, except that if the Company and the Savings Bank own more than 20% of the
stock of a corporation  distributing a dividend,  80% of any dividends  received
may be deducted.

Florida  Taxation.  The Savings Bank files Florida  franchise  tax returns.  For
Florida  franchise tax purposes,  savings  institutions are presently taxed at a
rate  equal to 5.5% of  taxable  income.  For  this  purpose,  "taxable  income"
generally  means  federal  taxable  income,   subject  to  certain   adjustments
(including the addition of interest income on State and municipal  obligations).

                               1998 ANNUAL REPORT







                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


The  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of  1995  evidences  Congress'
determination  that the disclosure of  forward-looking  information is desirable
for  investors  and  encourages  such  disclosure by providing a safe harbor for
forward-looking   statements  by  corporate  management.   This  Annual  Report,
including  the  Letter  to  Shareholders  and the  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis  of   Financial   Condition   and  Results  of   Operations,   contains
forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. In order to comply
with the terms of the safe harbor,  the Company  notes that a variety of factors
could cause the Company's  actual  results and  experience to differ  materially
from the anticipated  results or other  expectations  expressed in the Company's
forward-looking  statements.  The risks and  uncertainties  that may  affect the
operations,  performance,  development,  growth  projections  and results of the
Company's  business include,  but are not limited to, the growth of the economy,
interest  rate  movements,  timely  development  by the  Company  of  technology
enhancements for its products and operating  systems,  the impact of competitive
products,  services and pricing,  customer business requirements,  Congressional
legislation  and similar  matters.  Readers of this report are  cautioned not to
place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking  statements  which  are  subject  to
influence  by the named risk factors and  unanticipated  future  events.  Actual
results, accordingly, may differ materially from management expectations.

Dear Stockholders:

Each  year we are  pleased  to  provide  an  annual  report  for  review  by our
stockholders and other interested  parties.  The purpose of the annual report is
to present you with detailed  information  regarding FFLC Bancorp,  Inc., and to
describe ongoing activities of the Company.

The year 1998 was an  excellent  year in terms of financial  performance  by the
Company.  Each  quarter  of the  year set a new  record  for  quarterly  profit,
resulting in record earnings for the full year. The Company's subsidiary,  First
Federal  Savings  Bank,  enjoyed a year of  increases  in both loan  volume  and
deposits.  The Bank ended the year with total assets greater in amount than ever
and with strong momentum going into 1999.

For FFLC  Bancorp,  earnings for the year totaled a record $4.4  million,  a 17%
increase in net  earnings  over 1997,  which had been the  previous  record with
earnings of $3.8 million.  Basic earnings per share for 1998 were $1.22 compared
to $1.01 for 1997.

Growth of the Bank has been a primary  focus and we achieved  continued  success
this past year. During 1998, loan originations totaled $198.7 million, a gain of
29% above the prior year. The Bank's  residential loan volume amounted to $109.2
million,  an increase of 14% above 1997.  Commercial loans originated during the
year totaled  $58.9  million,  up 82% from 1997.  Consumer  lending also enjoyed
increased volume,  with total originations of $27.3 million, a gain of 18% above
the prior year.  Total loans  outstanding  at year-end were $401.5  million,  an
increase of 22%. As you will recall, we started the commercial  lending division
at the Bank in 1997 and the large percentage gain in that area is to be expected
in such a new division.

We also achieved growth in the Bank's deposit division.  For the year,  deposits
increased to a record of $351.0 million,  a gain of $35.6 million,  or 11%. As I
mentioned  in the 1997  annual  report,  the Bank  has been  placing  additional
emphasis on attracting  checking and other types of  transaction  accounts.  For
1998, we posted nearly half of the deposit gain in transaction accounts.

We continue to expand the Bank facilities in the Central Florida market.  During
the first half of 1999,  First Federal will open three new branch  offices.  The
first is in  Inverness,  the county seat of Citrus  County.  That  location  was
purchased as part of the NationsBank/Barnett Bank disposition of branch offices.
Citrus  County  is to the west of the two  counties  currently  served  by First
Federal and is a natural geographic  extension for the Bank. The second location
is Bushnell,  the county seat of Sumter County,  located in the southern half of
that  county.  The  Bushnell  branch  will have a  storefront  location in a new
Winn-Dixie  shopping  center and will  complement the Bank's  existing  Wildwood
branch located in the northern half of Sumter County.  The third office is being
constructed on the grounds of a new Winn-Dixie  shopping  center at the southern
end of  Lake  County.  That  is an  area  experiencing  considerable  growth  in
population, and ours will be only the second bank in the immediate area.

The news  media has been  giving  considerable  attention  to the  impact of the
rollover  from the year 1999 to 2000. We have been working for over two years in
preparing for the century change and the data  processing firm that provides the
bulk of the Bank's  data  processing  has been  working at it for an even longer
period of time. Last November,  First Federal and many other bank clients of the
data processing firm conducted  extensive testing.  We advanced our computers in
time to January 3, 2000,  and  performed all manner of  transactions  on deposit
accounts,  loan accounts,  and general ledger accounts.  I am pleased to say the
test  proved to be  successful.  Although  there were minor  problems  with some
reports  printed   following  the  test,  all  transactions   were  successfully
performed.  While  we  are  pleased  with  the  success  of  the  test,  we  are
nevertheless  continuing  to work on  preparation  for the  year  2000.  We have
upgraded  our  computer  network  system  and have  replaced  all  non-compliant
hardware.  While we have confidence that our systems will work properly, we have
been  preparing  contingency  plans  in  the  event  that  there  are  temporary
interruptions  of power or  communications.  More than ever, I think it is worth
reminding our depositors that no one has ever lost a penny in an account insured
by the FDIC. Customers have trusted First Federal for over sixty-five years, and
we believe that the Bank continues to be the safest place for your money.

The directors,  officers and staff of FFLC Bancorp appreciate the support of our
stockholders  over the past five years. Our focus remains on profitably  serving
the  banking  needs  of our  local  communities,  and we  believe  we have  made
continued progress to that end.

Cordially yours,





/s/Stephen T. Kurtz

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

First Federal Savings Bank of Lake County, the subsidiary of FFLC, was organized
in 1934 as a federally chartered savings and loan association and converted to a
federally  chartered  stock savings bank on January 4, 1994.  The Savings Bank's
principal  business  continues to be attracting retail deposits from the general
public and investing those deposits, together with principal repayments on loans
and investments and funds generated from operations, primarily in mortgage loans
secured  by   one-to-four-family,   owner-occupied   homes,   commercial  loans,
securities  and, to a lesser  extent,  construction  loans,  consumer  and other
loans, and  multi-family  residential  mortgage loans. In addition,  the Savings
Bank holds  investments  permitted  by federal  laws and  regulations  including
securities  issued by the U.S.  Government  and  agencies  thereof.  The Savings
Bank's revenues are derived  principally  from interest on its mortgage loan and
mortgage-backed   securities  portfolios  and  interest  and  dividends  on  its
investment securities.

The Savings Bank is a community-oriented  savings institution offering a variety
of  financial  services  to meet the needs of the  communities  it  serves.  The
Savings Bank's deposit gathering and lending markets are primarily  concentrated
in the communities  surrounding its full service offices located in Lake, Sumter
and Citrus counties in central Florida. Management believes that its offices are
located in communities  that generally can be characterized as rural service and
retirement communities with residential neighborhoods comprised predominately of
one-to-four-family  residences.  The Savings Bank is the largest (by asset size)
locally-based  financial  institution in Lake County, and serves its market area
with a wide selection of residential  mortgage loans and other retail  financial
services.  Management  considers  the Savings  Bank's  reputation  for financial
strength and customer  service as a major  advantage in attracting and retaining
customers  in its  market  area and  believes  it  benefits  from its  community
orientation as well as its established deposit base and level of core deposits.

The Savings Bank had net income of $4.4 million for the year ended  December 31,
1998,  compared to net income of $3.8  million for the year ended  December  31,
1997. At December 31, 1998, the Savings Bank had total assets of $463.8 million,
an increase of 16% over total  assets of $400.2  million at December  31,  1997.
That increase  resulted  primarily  from an $73.6 million,  or 23%,  increase in
loans  receivable  from $315.4  million at December  31, 1997 to $389 million at
December  31,  1998,  reflecting  increased  local  loan  demand.  Cash and cash
equivalents  increased  $7.2 million or 46% from $15.7 million to $22.9 million.
Securities  decreased  $18.2  million or 31.1% during 1998.  Deposits  increased
$35.6 million,  or 11%, from $315.4 million at December 31, 1997 to $351 million
at December  31,  1998.  Advances  from  Federal  Home Loan Bank  increased  $26
million,  while other  borrowed funds  increased  $789,000 for a net increase of
$26.8 million or 89% in borrowings. Stockholders' equity increased $1.8 million.

REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

General

The  operating  results of the Savings  Bank are  affected  by Federal  laws and
regulations and the Savings Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination
and supervision by the Office of Thrift Supervision  ("OTS"),  as its chartering
agency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC"), as the deposit
insurer.  The Savings  Bank is a member of the Federal  Home Loan Bank  ("FHLB")
System and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable  limits by the FDIC
under the SAIF ("Savings  Association  Insurance  Fund").  The Savings Bank must
file reports with the OTS and the FDIC  concerning  its activities and financial
condition in addition to obtaining  regulatory  approvals prior to entering into
certain  transactions  such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial
institutions.  There are periodic  examinations  by the OTS and the FDIC to test
the  Savings  Bank's  compliance  with  various  regulatory  requirements.   The
activities of savings institutions are governed by the Home Owner's Loan Act, as
amended (the "HOLA"),  and, in certain  respects,  the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act (the "FDIA").  A more complete  description of the HOLA and FDIA is included
in the Form 10-K.

Capital Requirements

The OTS capital regulations  require savings  institutions to meet three capital
standards: a 1.5% tangible capital standard; a 3% leverage (core capital) ratio;
and an 8% risk-based  capital  standard.  Under the OTS final rule  implementing
FDICIA,  generally, a well-capitalized  institution is defined as one that meets
the following capital standards:  a 5% tangible capital standard;  a 6% leverage
(core capital) ratio; and a 10% risk-based  capital  standard,  and has not been
notified by its federal banking agency that it is in a "troubled  condition." At
December 31, 1998, the Savings Bank met each of its capital requirements and met
the criteria of a "well-capitalized" institution as defined above.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit
insurance  premiums  according to the level of risk involved in an institution's
activities. An institution's risk category is based upon whether the institution
is  classified as "well  capitalized,"  "adequately  capitalized"  or "less than
adequately  capitalized" and one of three supervisory  subcategories within each
capital group.  The supervisory  subgroup to which an institution is assigned is
based on a supervisory  evaluation and information  which the FDIC determines to
be relevant to the institution's  financial  condition and the risk posed to the
deposit  insurance fund.  Effective January 1, 1997, the FDIC lowered the annual
assessment  rates for SAIF members to 0 to 27 basis points,  as discussed below.
The FDIC has authority to raise premiums if deemed necessary.  If such action is
taken, it could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the institution.

On September  30,  1996,  legislation  was enacted  which,  among other  things,
imposed a special one-time assessment on SAIF member institutions, including the
Savings Bank, to  recapitalize  the SAIF and spread the obligations for payments
of Financing  Corporation ("FICO") bonds across all SAIF and Bank Insurance Fund
("BIF")  members.  The FDIC  special  assessment  levied  amounted to 65.7 basis
points on SAIF  assessable  deposits  held as of March  31,  1995.  The  special
assessment  of $1.7 million  before taxes was  recognized by the Savings Bank in
the third quarter of 1996 and was tax deductible.  That  legislation  eliminated
the substantial  disparity between the amount that BIF and SAIF members had been
paying for deposit insurance premiums.
<PAGE>

During 1998,  BIF members paid a portion of the FICO payment equal to 1.22 basis
points on  BIF-insured  deposits,  compared to 6.22 basis points payable by SAIF
members  on  SAIF-insured  deposits,  and will pay a pro rata  share of the FICO
payment  on the  earlier  of  January  1, 2000 or the date  upon  which the last
savings association,  such as the Savings Bank, ceases to exist. The legislation
also requires BIF and SAIF to be merged provided that subsequent  legislation is
adopted to eliminate the savings association charter and no savings associations
remain as of that time.



                                        9
<PAGE>
Effective January 1, 1997, the FDIC lowered annual SAIF assessment rates to 0 to
27 basis  points,  a range  comparable  to those of BIF members,  although  SAIF
members  continue to be subject to the higher  FICO  payments  described  above.
Management cannot predict the level of FDIC insurance  assessments on an ongoing
basis or whether the BIF and SAIF will eventually be merged.

Under the FDIA,  insurance  of  deposits  may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a
finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound  practices,  is in
an unsafe or unsound  condition  to  continue  operations  or has  violated  any
applicable law, regulation,  rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the
OTS. The management of the Savings Bank does not know of any practice, condition
or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

The  Company  is  acutely  aware of the many  areas  affected  by the Year  2000
computer issue, as addressed by the Federal Financial  Institutions  Examination
Council  ("FFIEC") in its  interagency  statement  which provided an outline for
institutions  to manage the Year 2000 challenges  effectively.  A Year 2000 plan
has been  approved by the Board of Directors  which  includes  multiple  phases,
tasks to be completed, and target dates for completion.  Issues addressed in the
plan include  awareness,  assessment,  renovation,  validation,  implementation,
testing, and contingency planning.

The Company has formed a Year 2000  committee that is charged with the oversight
of completing the Year 2000 project on a timely basis. The Company has completed
its  awareness,  assessment and  renovation  phases and is actively  involved in
validating  and  implementing  its plan.  At the present  time,  the Company has
substantially  completed its testing  phase,  the results of which indicate that
the Company's  internal systems appear to be Year 2000 ready. Since it routinely
upgrades  and  purchases  technologically  advanced  software  and hardware on a
continual   basis,   the  Company  has  determined   that  the  cost  of  making
modifications  to  correct  any Year  2000  issues  will not  materially  affect
reported  operating  results.  Management  does not believe that the Company has
incurred or will incur material costs associated with the Year 2000 issue.

The Company's vendors and suppliers have been contacted for written confirmation
of their  product  readiness  for Year 2000  compliance.  Negative or  deficient
responses are analyzed and  periodically  reviewed to prescribe  timely  actions
within the Company's contingency  planning.  The Company's main service provider
has  completed  testing of its mission  critical  application  software and item
processing software; the test results, which have been documented and validated,
are  deemed to be Year 2000  compliant.  FFIEC  guidance  on  testing  Year 2000
compliance  of  service   providers  states  that  proxy  tests  are  acceptable
compliance  tests.  In  proxy  testing,   the  service  provider  tests  with  a
representative  sample of financial  institutions that use a particular service,
with the results of such testing shared with all similarly  situated  clients of
the service provider. The Company has authorized the acceptance of proxy testing
since the proxy tests have been conducted with financial  institutions  that are
similar  in type and  complexity  to its own using the same  version of the Year
2000 ready software and the same hardware and operating systems.

The Company also recognizes the importance of determining that its borrowers are
facing the Year 2000 problem in a timely  manner to avoid  deterioration  of the
loan portfolio  solely due to this issue. All material  relationships  have been
identified and questionnaires  have been completed to assess the inherent risks.
Deposit customers have received statement stuffers and informational material in
this regard.  The Company plans to work on a one-on-one  basis with any borrower
who has been identified as having high Year 2000 risk exposure.
<PAGE>
Notwithstanding  our actions,  there can be no assurances  that all hardware and
software  that the  Company  will use will be Year  2000  compliant.  Management
cannot  predict  the  amount  of  financial  difficulties  it may  incur  due to
customers and vendors  inability to perform  according to their  agreements with
the  Company or the effects  that other  third  parties may cause as a result of
this issue.  Therefore,  there can be no assurance  that the failure or delay of
others to address the issue or that the costs  involved in such process will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,  financial  condition,
and results of operations.



                                       10

<PAGE>
Based on  testing  results  to date (as  noted  above),  the  Company's  mission
critical  systems  have been  deemed to be Year 2000 ready.  However,  a written
contingency  plan has been  developed to address  problems  that might be caused
from Year 2000 system  failures.  Testing of the contingency plan is in progress
and is scheduled to be  completed by June 30, 1999.  With regard to  non-mission
critical internal systems, the Company's  contingency plans are to replace those
systems that test as being  noncompliant.  Alternatively,  some systems could be
handled  manually on an interim basis.  Should outside service  providers not be
able  to  provide   compliant   systems,   the  Company  will  terminate   those
relationships  and  transfer  to  other  vendors.  It is  anticipated  that  the
Company's  deposit  customers will have increased demands for cash in the latter
part of 1999 and,  correspondingly,  the Company will maintain higher  liquidity
levels.

CREDIT RISK

The Savings Bank's primary  business is lending on residential  real estate,  an
activity  with  the  inherent  risk of  generating  potential  loan  losses  the
magnitude of which depend on a variety of factors affecting  borrowers which are
beyond the  control of the  Savings  Bank.  The  Savings  Bank has  underwriting
guidelines and credit review procedures designed to minimize such credit losses.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The  Company's  results of operations  are  dependent  primarily on net interest
income,   which  is  the   difference   between   the   income   earned  on  its
interest-earning  assets,  primarily its loans,  mortgage-backed  securities and
investment  securities,  and its  interest-bearing  liabilities,  consisting  of
deposits and borrowings. The Company's operating expenses principally consist of
employee  compensation,  occupancy expenses,  federal deposit insurance premiums
and  other  general  and  administrative  expenses.  The  Company's  results  of
operations are also  significantly  affected by general economic and competitive
conditions,  particularly changes in market interest rates,  government policies
and actions of regulatory authorities.

Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning
assets and expense on interest-bearing  liabilities. Net interest income depends
upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing  liabilities and
the interest rates earned or paid on them.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding
(i) the total dollar amount of interest and dividend  income of the Company from
interest-earning  assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar
amount of interest  expense on  interest-bearing  liabilities  and the resultant
average costs; (iii) net  interest/dividend  income; (iv) interest-rate  spread;
(v) net interest margin;  and (vi) weighted average yields and rates at December
31,  1998.  Yields and costs were  derived by dividing  income or expense by the
average balance of assets or liabilities,  respectively,  for the periods shown.
The average balance of loans receivable  includes loans on which the Company has
discontinued  accruing  interest.  The yields and costs  include  fees which are
considered to constitute adjustments to yields.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES

The Savings  Bank is required to  maintain  minimum  levels of liquid  assets as
defined  by  OTS  regulations.  That  requirement,   which  varies  periodically
depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows, is based upon a percentage
of deposits and  short-term  borrowings.  The current  required ratio is 4%. The
Savings Bank  historically  has maintained a level of liquid assets in excess of
the regulatory requirement.  Liquid assets consist of cash, cash equivalents and
short-and  intermediate-term  U.S.  Government and government agency securities.
The maintenance of liquid assets allows for the possibility of disintermediation
when interest rates fluctuate. The Savings Bank's liquidity ratios were 8.8% and
8.7% at December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, respectively.

The  Savings  Bank's  sources  of  funds  include  proceeds  from  payments  and
prepayments on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities,  proceeds from the
maturities of investment securities and deposits. While maturities and scheduled
amortization  of loans and  investment  securities  are  predictable  sources of
funds,  deposit inflows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by local
conditions, general interest rates, and regulatory changes.

At December 31, 1998, the Savings Bank had outstanding  commitments to originate
$9.2 million of loans,  to fund unused  lines of credit of $29.6  million and to
fund the undisbursed  portion of loans in process of $10.6 million.  The Savings
Bank  believes  that  it will  have  sufficient  funds  available  to  meet  its
commitments.  At December 31, 1998, certificates of deposit which were scheduled
to mature in one year or less totaled $168.1 million. Management believes, based
on past experience,  that a significant  portion of these funds will remain with
the Savings Bank.

REGULATORY  CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS

As a federally-chartered  financial institution, the Savings Bank is required to
maintain certain minimum amounts of regulatory  capital.  Regulatory  capital is
not a valuation  allowance and has not been created by charges against earnings.

MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
The Company's market risk arises primarily from  interest-rate  risk inherent in
its lending and deposit  taking  activities.  To that end,  management  actively
monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.  The measurement of market
risk associated  with financial  instruments is meaningful only when all related
and offsetting on- and  off-balance-sheet  transactions are aggregated,  and the
resulting  net  positions are  identified.  Disclosures  about the fair value of
financial instruments,  which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's  primary objective is managing  interest-rate  risk is to minimize
the  adverse  impact of changes  in  interest  rates on the Bank's net  interest
income and capital, while adjusting the Company's  asset-liability  structure to
obtain the maximum  yield-cost  spread on that  structure.  The  Company  relies
primarily  on its  asset-liability  structure  to  control  interest  rate risk.
However,  a sudden and  substantial  increase  in interest  rates may  adversely
impact the Company's  earnings,  to the extent that the interest  rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed,  to the same extent,  or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

ASSET /LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

The Savings  Bank's  primary  mission is to provide  home  ownership by offering
permanent and construction residential mortgage loans and consumer financing and
by  providing  conveniently  located  depository  facilities  with  transaction,
savings and certificate accounts. The Savings Bank's goal is to continue to be a
well-capitalized   and  profitable  operation  that  provides  service  that  is
professional,  efficient  and  courteous.  The Savings Bank seeks to fulfill its
mission and  accomplish  its goals by pursuing  the  following  strategies:  (i)
emphasizing lending in the one-to-four-family  residential mortgage market; (ii)
controlling interest-rate risk; (iii) managing deposit pricing and asset growth;
(iv) emphasizing cost control; and (v) maintaining asset quality by investing in
mortgage-backed  securities which, in management's  judgment,  provide a balance
between  yield  and  safety  in  a  home  mortgage  related  investment.  It  is
management's   intention  to  continue  to  employ  these  strategies  over  the
foreseeable future.

The Savings Bank's profitability,  like that of most financial institutions,  is
dependent  to a  large  extent  upon  its  net  interest  income,  which  is the
difference  between its  interest  income on  interest-earning  assets,  such as
loans,  mortgage-backed  securities and investment securities,  and its interest
expense on interest-bearing  liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings.
Financial  institutions  continue to be affected by general changes in levels of
interest rates and other economic factors beyond their control.  At December 31,
1998, the Savings  Bank's  one-year  interest  sensitivity  gap (the  difference
between the amount of  interest-earning  assets anticipated by the Savings Bank,
based on  certain  assumptions,  to mature or  reprice  within  one year and the
amount of interest-bearing liabilities anticipated by the Savings Bank, based on
certain  assumptions,  to mature or reprice  within one year) as a percentage of
total assets was a positive 19.9%. Generally, an institution with a positive gap
would  experience  an  increase  in net  interest  income  in a period of rising
interest rates.  However,  certain  shortcomings are inherent in the sensitivity
analysis  presented above. For example,  although certain assets and liabilities
may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different
manners to changes in market  interest  rates.  Therefore,  no assurance  can be
given  that the  Savings  Bank will be able to  maintain  its net  interest-rate
spread as market interest rates fluctuate.

The Savings Bank  monitors its  interest  rate risk through the  Asset/Liability
Committee  which  meets  weekly  and  reports  the  results  of such  monitoring
quarterly to the Board of  Directors.  The Savings  Bank's  policy is to seek to
maintain  a  balance  between   interest-earning   assets  and  interest-bearing
liabilities so that the Savings Bank's cumulative one-year gap ratio is within a
range  which  management  believes is  conducive  to  maintaining  profitability
without  incurring  undue risk. The Savings Bank has increased its investment in
adjustable-rate and shorter average life, fixed-rate mortgage-related securities
and,  generally,  has not retained in its portfolio 30 year fixed-rate loans, in
order to position itself against the  consequences of rising interest rates. The
Savings  Bank  also  maintains   liquid  assets  in  excess  of  the  regulatory
requirement,  allowing for the  possibility of  disintermediation  when interest
rates fluctuate. The Savings Bank's liquidity ratio of 8.8% at December 31, 1998
is significantly higher than the regulatory  requirement of 4%. In addition, the
Savings  Bank's large stable core deposit  base  resulting  from its  continuing
commitment  to quality  customer  service  has  historically  provided it with a
steady source of funds.

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 TO DECEMBER 31, 1997

General Operating Results.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 1998, was
    $4.4  million or $1.22 per share,  compared to net income for the year ended
    December  31, 1997 of $3.8  million or $1.01 per share.  The increase in net
    income  was  primarily  the  result of an  increase  of $2.2  million in net
    interest income before provision for loan losses for 1998.

Interest Income.  Interest  income  increased  $4.0 million,  or 14%, from $28.2
    million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 to $32.2  million for the year
    ended  December 31, 1998. The increase was due to an increase in the average
    balance of total  interest-earning  assets,  primarily  loans,  from  $361.1
    million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 to $404.1 million for the year
    ended December 31, 1998, an increase of $43 million,  or 12% and an increase
    in the  average  yield on  interest-earning  assets  from 7.80% for the year
    ended  December 31, 1997 to 7.96% for the year ended  December 31, 1998. The
    average yield on loans  decreased from 8.31% for the year ended December 31,
    1997 to 8.27% for the year ended  December  31, 1998.  The average  yield on
    securities  decreased  from 6.35% for the year ended  December  31,  1997 to
    6.32% for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  The  average  yield on other
    interest earning assets decreased from 5.88% for the year ended December 31,
    1997 to 5.82% for the year ended December 31, 1998.

Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $1.9 million from $15.4 million at
    December 31, 1997 to $17.3  million at December  31, 1998.  The increase was
    due to a $41.7  million  or 13%  increase  in the  average  balance of total
    interest-bearing liabilities from $311.9 million for the year ended December
    31, 1997 to $353.6  million for the year ended  December  31, 1998 offset in
    part by a decrease  in the  weighted-average  rate paid on  interest-bearing
    liabilities from 4.94% during 1997 to 4.88% in 1998.

Provision  for Loan  Losses.  The  Savings  Bank's  provision  for  loan  losses
    increased from $649,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997 to $682,000 for
    the year ended  December  31,  1998.  The  increase of $33,000 is due to the
    growth of the loan  portfolio  and  reflects the Savings  Bank's  continuing
    policy of  evaluating  the  adequacy  of its  allowance  for loan losses and
    prevailing standards within the thrift industry.  Generally, such evaluation
    includes consideration of the level of nonperforming loans and the level and
    composition of the Savings Bank's loan portfolio.

Noninterest Income.  Noninterest income increased from $1.2 million for the year
    ended  December  31, 1997 to $1.3  million for the year ended  December  31,
    1998. The increase was due to a $258,000  increase in other service  charges
    and fees and a $73,000 increase in deposit account fees, which was partially
    offset by a $302,000 decrease in gain on sale of other assets.

Noninterest  Expense.  Noninterest  expense  consists  primarily of salaries and
    employee  benefits and  occupancy  expense.  Noninterest  expense  increased
    $973,000  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998  compared  to 1997.  This
    increase was primarily  due to a $544,000  increase in salaries and employee
    benefits and a $130,000 increase in occupancy  expense,  caused by growth of
    the Company.

Provision for Income  Taxes.  The  provision  for federal and state income taxes
    increased  from $2.1  million for the year ended  December  31, 1997 to $2.6
    million  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998.  The  effective  tax rate
    increased  from 35.7% for the year ended  December 31, 1997 to 37.5% for the
    year ended December 31, 1998.

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 TO DECEMBER 31, 1996

General Operating Results.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 1997, was
    $3.8  million or $1.01 per share,  compared to net income for the year ended
    December  31, 1996 of $2.2  million or $.54 per share.  The  increase in net
    income  was  primarily  the  result of an  increase  of $1.5  million in net
    interest income before provision for loan losses for 1997, and the effect of
    the one-time SAIF assessment during 1996 of $1.7 million before taxes.

Interest Income.  Interest income increased $3.9 million,  or 16.3%,  from $24.2
    million for the year ended  December 31, 1996 to $28.2  million for the year
    ended  December 31, 1997. The increase was due to an increase in the average
    balance of total  interest-earning  assets from $321.9  million for the year
    ended  December 31, 1996 to $361.1  million for the year ended  December 31,
    1997, an increase of $39.2 million,  or 12.2% and an increase in the average
    yield on interest-earning  assets from 7.52% for the year ended December 31,
    1996 to 7.80% for the year ended  December  31, 1997.  The average  yield on
    loans decreased from 8.33% for the year ended December 31, 1996 to 8.31% for
    the year ended December 31, 1997. The average yield on securities  increased
    from 6.22% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 to 6.35% for the year ended
    December  31,  1997.  The average  yield on other  interest  earning  assets
    increased  from 5.70% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 to 5.88% for the
    year ended December 31, 1997.

Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $2.5 million from $13.0 million at
    December 31, 1996 to $15.4  million at December  31, 1997.  The increase was
    due to a $41.6  million or 15.4%  increase in the  average  balance of total
    interest-bearing liabilities from $270.3 million for the year ended December
    31,  1996 to $311.9  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1997 and an
    increase in the weighted-average  rate paid on interest-bearing  liabilities
    from 4.79% during 1996 to 4.94% in 1997.

Provision  for Loan  Losses.  The  Savings  Bank's  provision  for  loan  losses
    increased from $107,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996 to $649,000 for
    the year ended  December  31,  1997.  The increase of $542,000 is due to the
    growth of the  commercial  loan  portfolio  and reflects the Savings  Bank's
    continuing  policy of  evaluating  the  adequacy of its  allowance  for loan
    losses and prevailing standards within the thrift industry.  Generally, such
    evaluation  includes  consideration of the level of nonperforming  loans and
    the level and composition of the Savings Bank's loan portfolio.

Noninterest  Income.  Noninterest  income  increased  from $809,000 for the year
    ended  December  31, 1996 to $1.2  million for the year ended  December  31,
    1997. The increase was due to a gain on the sale of other assets during 1997
    of $302,000,  with no  corresponding  amount  during 1996 and an increase in
    other  service  charges and fees of $94,000 for the year ended  December 31,
    1997.

Noninterest  Expense.  Noninterest  expense  consists  primarily of salaries and
    employee  benefits,   occupancy  expense  and  deposit  insurance  premiums.
    Noninterest  expense decreased $826,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997
    compared to 1996.  This  decrease was  primarily  due to the  one-time  SAIF
    recapitalization  expense of $1.7 million during 1996 and a related decrease
    in deposit  insurance  premium of $477,000 during 1997,  partially offset by
    increases  in salaries  and  employee  benefits of  $934,000  and  occupancy
    expense of $118,000.  The remaining items in noninterest  expense  increased
    $254,000  for the year ended  December  31, 1997  compared to the year ended
    December 31, 1996 primarily due to the growth of the Company.

Provision for Income  Taxes.  The  provision  for federal and state income taxes
    increased  from $1.5  million for the year ended  December  31, 1996 to $2.1
    million  for the year  ended  December  31,  1997.  The  effective  tax rate
    decreased  from 40.4% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 to 35.7% for the
    year ended December 31, 1997.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Consolidated  Financial  Statements and Notes thereto  presented herein have
been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP,  which  requires  the  measurement  of
financial  position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering the changes in the relative  purchasing power of money over time due
to inflation.  The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the
Savings Bank's  operations.  Unlike most  industrial  companies,  nearly all the
assets and liabilities of the Savings Bank are monetary in nature.  As a result,
interest rates have a greater impact on the Savings Bank's  performance  than do
the effects of general levels of inflation.  Interest  rates do not  necessarily
move in the same  direction  or to the same  extent  as the  price of goods  and
services.

FUTURE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS

The FASB has recently  issued the  following  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards which is relevant to the Company:

    Financial Accounting  Standards 133 - Accounting for Derivative  Investments
    and Hedging  Activities  requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the
    balance  sheet as assets or  liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or
    losses  resulting from changes in the values of those  derivatives  would be
    accounted  for  depending  on the use of the  derivatives  and whether  they
    qualify for hedge accounting. The key criterion for hedge accounting is that
    the hedging  relationship  must be highly effective in achieving  offsetting
    changes in fair value or cash flows.  The Company  will be required to adopt
    this Statement  effective  January 1, 2000.  Management  does not anticipate
    that this Statement will have a material impact on the Company.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
    FFLCBancorp,  Inc. (the "Holding  Company") was  incorporated in Delaware on
        September 16, 1993 as a unitary  savings and loan holding  company.  The
        Holding  Company  completed  its public  offering  of  4,603,032  shares
        (adjusted  for  stock  split)  of common  stock on  January  4, 1994 and
        acquired First Federal  Savings Bank of Lake County (the "Savings Bank")
        in   connection   with   the   Savings   Bank's    conversion   from   a
        federally-chartered  mutual savings association to a federally-chartered
        stock savings bank.  The Holding  Company's  acquisition  of the Savings
        Bank was  accounted for as a  pooling-of-interest.  The Savings Bank was
        established  in 1934 as a  federally-chartered  mutual  savings and loan
        association.   The  Savings   Bank  is  a   community-oriented   savings
        institution which offers a variety of financial  services to individuals
        and  businesses  primarily  located in Lake  County,  Sumter  County and
        Citrus County,  Florida. The deposits of the Savings Bank are insured by
        the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC") through the Savings
        Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF").

    Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated  financial statements include
        the accounts of the Holding  Company,  the Savings Bank, and the Savings
        Bank's  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Lake County Service  Corporation (the
        "Service Corporation").  All significant  intercompany  transactions and
        balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

    General. The accounting and reporting policies of FFLC Bancorp, Inc. and its
        subsidiaries  (together,  the "Company")  conform to generally  accepted
        accounting  principles  and  to  general  practices  within  the  thrift
        industry.  All per share  amounts  presented  reflect  the effect of the
        five-for-three  stock split in November,  1997. The following summarizes
        the significant accounting policies of the Company:

    Estimates.  The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with
        generally accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management to make
        estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
        liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the
        date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues
        and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual results could differ
        from those estimates.

    Cash and  Cash  Equivalents.   For  the  purpose  of   presentation  in  the
        consolidated  statements of cash flows,  cash and cash  equivalents  are
        defined as those amounts included in the balance-sheet caption "cash and
        cash equivalents."

        The  Savings  Bank is  required  to  maintain  certain  average  reserve
        balances  pursuant to  regulations of the Federal  Reserve Board.  These
        balances  must be  maintained  in the form of vault cash or  noninterest
        bearing  deposits at a Federal  Reserve Bank.  The Savings Bank exceeded
        this  requirement,  which was $1.1  million and $843,000 at December 31,
        1998 and 1997, respectively.

    Securities. The Company may classify its securities as either trading,  held
        to  maturity  or  available  for  sale.   Trading  securities  are  held
        principally  for resale and  recorded at their fair  values.  Unrealized
        gains and losses on  trading  securities  are  included  immediately  in
        earnings.  Held-to-maturity  securities  are those which the Company has
        the positive  intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at
        amortized cost.  Available-for-sale securities consist of securities not
        classified as trading  securities  nor as  held-to-maturity  securities.
        Unrealized holding gains and losses,  net of tax, on  available-for-sale
        securities  are  reported  as a net  amount in a separate  component  of
        stockholders'  equity  until  realized.  Gains and losses on the sale of
        available-for-sale     securities    are     determined     using    the
        specific-identification  method.  Premiums and  discounts on  securities
        available  for sale and held to  maturity  are  recognized  in  interest
        income using the interest method over the period to maturity.



                                       27
<PAGE>
    Loans  Receivable.  Loans  receivable  that  management  has the  intent and
        ability to hold for the foreseeable  future or until maturity or pay-off
        are   reported  at  their   outstanding   principal   adjusted  for  any
        charge-offs,  the  allowance  for loan losses,  and any deferred fees or
        costs on originated loans.

        Loan  origination  fees  and  certain  direct   origination   costs  are
        capitalized  and recognized as an adjustment of the yield of the related
        loan.

        The  accrual of  interest on impaired  loans is  discontinued  when,  in
        management's  opinion,  the borrower  may be unable to meet  payments as
        they become  due.  When  interest  accrual is  discontinued,  all unpaid
        accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized
        only to the extent cash payments are received.

        The  allowance  for loan  losses is  increased  by charges to income and
        decreased by  charge-offs  (net of  recoveries).  Management's  periodic
        evaluation  of the adequacy of the  allowance is based on the  Company's
        past loan loss  experience,  known and inherent  risks in the portfolio,
        adverse  situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the
        estimated  value of any  underlying  collateral,  and  current  economic
        conditions.

    Foreclosed Real Estate.  Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu
        of, loan  foreclosure are to be sold and are initially  recorded at fair
        value at the date of foreclosure  establishing  a new cost basis.  After
        foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the
        real  estate is  carried at the lower of  carrying  amount or fair value
        less cost to sell.  Revenue and expenses from  operations and changes in
        the valuation  allowance are included in the consolidated  statements of
        income.

    Premises and  Equipment.  Land is carried at cost.  The Company's  premises,
        furniture and equipment and leasehold  improvements are carried at cost,
        less accumulated  depreciation and amortization  computed principally by
        the straight-line method.

    Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently
        enacted income tax rates  applicable to the period in which the deferred
        tax assets or  liabilities  are  expected to be realized or settled.  As
        changes  in tax laws or rates  are  enacted,  deferred  tax  assets  and
        liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.

    Stock-Based  Compensation.  Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No.
        123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation"  establishes  a "fair
        value" based method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans and
        encourages  all entities to adopt that method of  accounting  for all of
        their  employee stock  compensation  plans.  However,  it also allows an
        entity to  continue to measure  compensation  cost for those plans using
        the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion
        No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees."  The Company has
        elected  to  follow  APB  Opinion  25  and  related  interpretations  in
        accounting for its employee stock options.


                                       28

    Off-Balance  Sheet  Instruments.  In the ordinary  course of  business,  the
        Company has entered into  off-balance-sheet  instruments  consisting  of
        commitments to extend credit and commitments under lines of credit. Such
        financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they
        are funded.

    FairValues of Financial  Instruments.  The following methods and assumptions
        were  used  by the  Company  in  estimating  fair  values  of  financial
        instruments:

        Cash and Cash  Equivalents.  The carrying amounts of cash and short-term
        instruments approximate their fair value.

        Securities.  Fair  values  for  securities  are based on  quoted  market
        prices.  If quoted market prices are not available,  fair value is based
        on quoted market prices for similar securities.

        Loans Receivable.  For variable-rate  loans that reprice  frequently and
        have no  significant  change in credit  risk,  fair  values are based on
        carrying  values.  Fair values for  certain  fixed-rate  mortgage  (e.g.
        one-to-four family  residential),  commercial real estate and commercial
        loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses,  using interest
        rates  currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers
        of similar credit quality.

        Federal  Home Loan Bank Stock.  Fair value of the Bank's  investment  in
        FHLB stock is based on its redemption  value,  which is its cost of $100
        per share.

        Deposit  Liabilities.  The fair values disclosed for demand,  NOW, money
        market and  savings  deposits  are, by  definition,  equal to the amount
        payable  on demand  at the  reporting  date  (that  is,  their  carrying
        amounts).  Fair  values  for  fixed-rate  certificates  of  deposit  are
        estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest
        rates   currently  being  offered  on  certificates  to  a  schedule  of
        aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.

        Borrowed  Funds.  The carrying  amounts of borrowings  under  repurchase
        agreements  approximate their fair values.  Fair values of FHLB advances
        are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company's
        current  incremental  borrowing  rates for  similar  types of  borrowing
        arrangements.

        Accrued Interest.  The carrying amounts of accrued interest  approximate
        their fair values.

        Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments. Fair values for off-balance-sheet lending
        commitments  are based on fees  currently  charged to enter into similar
        agreements,  taking into account the remaining  terms of the  agreements
        and the counterparties' credit standing.

    Income Per Share of Common  Stock.  During  1997,  the  Company  adopted the
        provisions  of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 128,  "Earnings Per
        Share" (SFAS No. 128).  SFAS No. 128 provides  accounting  and reporting
        standards for calculating  earnings per share. Basic income per share of
        common  stock has been  computed by dividing the net income for the year
        by the weighted-average  number of shares outstanding.  Shares of common
        stock  purchased  by the  Employee  Stock  Option Plan  ("ESOP") and the
        Retention and Recognition Plan ("RRP") incentive plans (see Note 16) are
        only considered outstanding when the shares are released or committed to
        be released for allocation to participants. The ESOP initially purchased
        368,242  shares,  of which 4,383 shares were released for  allocation to
        participants  each month  beginning in January,  1994. The RRP initially
        purchased  184,122  shares,  of which 177,517,  179,541 and 179,541 were
        allocated to participants  and are considered  outstanding for the years
        ended December 31, 1996,  1997 and 1998,  respectively.  At December 31,
        1998,  109,794  shares remain  uncommitted  under both plans and are not
        considered outstanding for purposes of the computation of net income per
        share of common stock.  Diluted income per share is computed by dividing
        net  income  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  outstanding
        including  the dilutive  effect of stock  options (see Note 16) computed
        using  the  treasury  stock  method  prescribed  by SFAS  No.  128.  The
        following  table  presents  the  calculation  of net income per share of
        common stock:

    Future Accounting  Requirements.  The FASB has recently issued the following
        Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  which is relevant to the
        Company:
        
        Financial   Accounting   Standards  133  -  Accounting   for  Derivative
        Investments  and  Hedging   Activities   requires  companies  to  record
        derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or  liabilities,  measured at
        fair  value.  Gains or losses  resulting  from  changes in the values of
        those  derivatives  would be accounted  for  depending on the use of the
        derivatives  and  whether  they  qualify for hedge  accounting.  The key
        criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging  relationship must be
        highly effective in achieving  offsetting  changes in fair value or cash
        flows.  The Company will be required to adopt this  Statement  effective
        January 1, 2000. Management does not anticipate that this Statement will
        have a material impact on the Company.

    Reclassifications.  Certain  amounts  in  the  1996  and  1997  consolidated
        financial statements have been reclassified to
        conform to the presentation for 1998.

    Securities  have been  classified  according  to  management's  intent.  The

    Securities  with a carrying  value of  approximately  $2.9  million and $3.4
        million at December  31, 1998 and 1997,  respectively,  were  pledged to
        secure  public  funds and tax  deposits.  The Company  has also  pledged
        securities  with a carrying value of $3.1 million for  borrowings  under
        retail  repurchase  agreements  with customers at December 31, 1998 (See
        Note 6).

    There were no sales of securities  during the years ended December 31, 1998,
        1997 and 1996.

    The Company's portfolio of mortgage-backed securities include collateralized
        mortgage  obligations  (CMOs).  CMOs are generally divided into tranches
        whereby  principal  repayments  from the  underlying  mortgages are used
        sequentially  to retire the securities  according to the priority of the
        tranches. The Company invests in the following  collateralized  mortgage
        obligation tranches:  sequential,  planned amortization class,  targeted
        amortization class or support or companion  floating-rate tranches. Such
        tranches  have  stated  maturities  ranging  from 1-22  years;  however,
        because of  prepayments,  the  expected  weighted-average  life of these
        securities at December 31, 1998 is approximately 1.3 years. The majority
        of the CMOs  owned by the  Company  are  insured or  guaranteed,  either
        directly or indirectly,  through  mortgage-backed  securities underlying
        the  obligations  by either the FNMA,  FHLMC or GNMA.  Depending  on the
        amount of the Company's  available-for-sale  mortgage-backed securities,
        fluctuations  in the interest rate  environment  and other factors,  the
        Company may experience  material effects on its capital resources due to
        categorizing  these securities as available for sale. The Company's CMOs
        may be subject to price movements which typically result from prepayment
        on the underlying  obligations.  The Company's CMOs of $4.7 million have
        coupon rates ranging from 5.30% to 7.53% and had a weighted-average rate
        of 6.35% at December 31, 1998. The Company  purchases only CMOs rated AA
        or better by nationally recognized rating services.

    There were no impaired  loans  recognized  under SFAS 114 and 118 during the
        years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.

    The Company  originates or purchases  nonresidential  real  property  loans.
        These loans are considered by management to be of somewhat  greater risk
        of uncollectibility due to the dependency on income production or future
        development  of the  real  estate.  Nearly  all of  the  Company's  real
        property loans were  collateralized  by real property in Lake and Sumter
        Counties, Florida.

    Nonaccrual  loans  at  December  31,  1998  and 1997  totaled  $444,000  and
        $242,000,  respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 1998, interest
        income on loans would have been increased  approximately  $31,000 if the
        interest  on  nonaccrual  loans at December  31, 1998 had been  recorded
        under the original terms of such loans.  All of the nonaccrual  loans at
        December   31,   1998  and  1997  were   first-mortgage,   single-family
        residential loans or consumer loans.

    Mortgage loans  serviced  for others are not  included  in the  accompanying
        consolidated  balance  sheets.  The unpaid  principal  balances of these
        loans were approximately  $930,000 and $1.2 million at December 31, 1998
        and 1997, respectively.

    The security  agreement with FHLB includes a blanket floating lien requiring
        the Savings Bank to maintain first mortgage loans as pledged  collateral
        in an amount  equal to at least,  when  discounted  at 75% of the unpaid
        principal  balances,  100% of these  advances.  The  FHLB  stock is also
        pledged as  collateral  for these  advances.  At December 31, 1998,  the
        Savings  Bank could borrow up to $100  million  under the FHLB  security
        agreement.

    Other borrowed  funds were  composed of retail  repurchase  agreements  with
        customers during 1998 and dollar reverse  repurchase  agreements  during
        1997.  The  Company  enters  into  retail  repurchase   agreements  with
        customers in which the funds received are accounted for as borrowings to
        the  Company.  Mortgage-backed  securities  sold  under  dollar  reverse
        repurchase  agreements were delivered to the broker-dealers who arranged
        the transactions. The broker-dealers may have sold, loaned, or otherwise
        disposed of such  securities  to other  parties in the normal  course of
        their operations, and have agreed to resell to the Company substantially
        identical securities at the maturities of the agreements.

    Retained  earnings at  December  31,  1998 and 1997  includes  approximately
        $5,810,000  for which no deferred  federal income tax liability has been
        recognized.  This amount  represents an allocation of income to bad debt
        deductions for tax purposes only.  Reduction of amounts so allocated for
        purposes  other than tax bad debt  losses or  adjustments  arising  from
        carryback of net  operating  losses would create income for tax purposes
        only,  which would be subject to the then current  corporate  income tax
        rate. The unrecorded  deferred  income tax liability on the above amount
        was approximately $2,186,000 at December 31, 1998 and 1997.

    The Small  Business Job  Protection  Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act") enacted on
        August 2, 1996 requires savings institutions,  such as the Savings Bank,
        to recapture  certain  portions of their  accumulated bad debt reserves,
        and eliminated the Percentage of Taxable Income Method of accounting for
        bad debts for tax purposes.  The Savings Bank was required to change its
        method of accounting for bad debts for tax purposes effective January 1,
        1996. In addition, the Savings Bank was required to recapture the excess
        of its bad debt  reserves  at  December  31,  1995  over  its base  year
        reserves at December 31, 1987,  ratably over a six-year period beginning
        in 1998.  At  December  31,  1998,  the Savings  Bank had  approximately
        $757,000 of deferred tax  liabilities  recorded for the recapture of its
        excess bad debt reserves.

(8)  Pension Plan
    Prior to 1996, the Company participated in a multi-employer  defined benefit
        pension plan (the "Pension Plan") which covered substantially all of its
        employees. The Company's funding policy with respect to the Pension Plan
        was to make an annual  contribution  determined  by the  Pension  Plan's
        actuaries that would not be less than the minimum required contribution,
        nor greater than the maximum  federal income tax deductible  limit.  The
        Company's contributions for the Pension Plan for the year ended December
        31, 1995 was $65,000.  During 1996, the Company decided to withdraw from
        participation  in  the  Pension  Plan,  and  accordingly,  participants'
        benefits were frozen and participants  became fully vested at that date.
        The Company did not make a contribution to the Pension Plan for 1996.

    In  connection   with  the  above,   the  Company   adopted  a  new  defined
        contribution  profit sharing  401(k) plan (the "401(k) Plan")  effective
        April 1, 1996. All employees who have met a minimum service  requirement
        (1,000 hours of service in a twelve-month period) may participate in the
        Plan. Under the 401(k) Plan, a participant may elect to contribute up to
        15% of their annual  compensation,  subject to IRS  limitations on total
        annual contributions.  The Company will make contributions to the 401(k)
        Plan on a monthly  basis at two percent of  participants'  compensation.
        Contributions  to the 401(k) Plan for the year ended  December  31, 1998
        and 1997 were $46,000 and $37,000, respectively.

(9)  Financial Instruments
    The Company is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet risk
        in the normal  course of  business  to meet the  financing  needs of its
        customers  and to reduce its own  exposure to  fluctuations  in interest
        rates. These financial  instruments are commitments to extend credit and
<PAGE>
        may involve,  to varying degrees,  elements of credit and  interest-rate
        risk in excess of the  amount  recognized  in the  consolidated  balance
        sheet. The contract amounts of these  instruments  reflect the extent of
        involvement the Company has in these financial instruments.

    The Company's  exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
        other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit
        is  represented  by the  contractual  amount of those  instruments.  The
        Company uses the same credit  policies in making  commitments as it does
        for on-balance-sheet instruments.


                                       37
<PAGE>
    Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
        there is no  violation of any  condition  established  in the  contract.
        Commitments  generally have fixed expiration dates or other  termination
        clauses and may require  payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments
        are expected to expire  without being drawn upon,  the total  commitment
        amounts do not  necessarily  represent  future  cash  requirements.  The
        Company  evaluates each customer's  credit  worthiness on a case-by-case
        basis.  The amount of  collateral  obtained if deemed  necessary  by the
        Company  upon  extension  of  credit  is  based on  management's  credit
        evaluation of the counterparty.

    The estimated  fair values of the Company's  financial  instruments  were as
        follows:

(10)  Significant Group Concentration of Credit Risk
     The Company grants real estate,  commercial and consumer loans to customers
         primarily  in the State of Florida  with the  majority of such loans in
         the Lake and Sumter County area.  Therefore,  the Company's exposure to
         credit risk is significantly  affected by changes in the economy of the
         Lake and Sumter County area.

     The contractual  amounts of credit related  financial  instruments  such as
         commitments  to  extend  credit  represent  the  amounts  of  potential
         accounting  loss should the contract be fully drawn upon,  the customer
         default and the value of any existing collateral become worthless.

</TABLE>

(12)  Commitments and Contingencies
    In  the  ordinary  course of business,  the Company has various  outstanding
        commitments  and  contingent  liabilities  that are not reflected in the
        accompanying consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company
        is a  defendant  in  certain  claims  and legal  actions  arising in the
        ordinary  course  of  business.  In the  opinion  of  management,  after
        consultation  with legal  counsel,  the  ultimate  disposition  of these
        matters  is not  expected  to  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
        consolidated financial condition of the Company.

(13)  Restrictions on Retained Earnings
    The Savings  Bank is  subject  to  certain  restrictions  on the  amount  of
        dividends  that it may declare  without prior  regulatory  approval.  At
        December 31, 1998, approximately $16.9 million of retained earnings were
        available for dividend declaration without prior regulatory approval.

(14)  Regulatory Matters
    The Savings  Bank is  subject  to  various  regulatory  capital  requirement
        administered  by the federal banking  agencies.  Failure to meet minimum
        capital  requirements  can  initiate  certain   mandatory-and   possibly
        additional  discretionary-actions  by regulators  that,  if  undertaken,
        could  have  a  direct  material  effect  on  the  Company's   financial
        statements.   Under  capital  adequacy  guidelines  and  the  regulatory
        framework  for prompt  corrective  action,  the  Savings  Bank must meet
        specific capital  guidelines that involve  quantitative  measures of the
        Savings Bank's assets, liabilities,  and certain off-balance-sheet items
        as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The Savings Bank's
        capital  amounts  and  classification  are also  subject to  qualitative
        judgements by the regulators  about  components,  risk  weightings,  and
        other factors.
<PAGE>
    Quantitative  measures  established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
        require the Savings Bank to maintain  minimum  amounts (set forth in the
        table below) of total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations)
        to  risk-weighted  assets  (as  defined).  Management  believes,  as  of
        December  31,  1998,  that the Savings  Bank meets all capital  adequacy
        requirements to which it is subject.

    As  of  December  31,  1998,  the  most  recent  notification  from  the OTS
        categorized  the Savings Bank as well  capitalized  under the regulatory
        framework  for  prompt  corrective  action.  To be  categorized  as well
        capitalized,  the Savings Bank must maintain  minimum  tangible,  tier I
        (core),  tier I (risk-based) and total risk-based  capital ratios as set
        forth in the  table.  There  are no  conditions  or  events  since  that
        notification  that  management  believes have changed the  institution's
        category.

    On  September 30, 1996,  legislation was enacted which,  among other things,
        imposed a  special  one-time  assessment  on SAIF  member  institutions,
        including  the Savings  Bank,  to  recapitalize  the SAIF and spread the
        obligations for payments of Financing  Corporation ("FICO") bonds across
        all SAIF and BIF members. The FDIC special assessment levied amounted to
        65.7 basis points on SAIF assessable deposits held as of March 31, 1995.
        The special  assessment  was recognized in the third quarter of 1996 and
        was tax  deductible.  The Savings Bank recorded a charge of $1.7 million
        before  taxes  during 1996 as a result of the FDIC  special  assessment.
        That legislation eliminated the substantial disparity between the amount
        that  BIF and  SAIF  members  had  been  paying  for  deposit  insurance
        premiums.

    Beginning on  January 1, 1997,  BIF  members  will pay a portion of the FICO
         payment equal to 1.3 basis points on BIF-insured deposits,  compared to
         6.48 basis points payable by SAIF members on SAIF-insured deposits, and
         will pay a pro rata share of the FICO payment on the earlier of January
         1, 2000 or the date upon which the last  savings  association,  such as
         the Savings Bank,  ceases to exist.  The legislation  also requires BIF
         and SAIF to be  merged by  January  1, 1999  provided  that  subsequent
         legislation is adopted to eliminate the savings association charter and
         no savings associations remain as of that time.

    The  FDIC  substantially  lowered SAIF  assessments to a range comparable to
         those of BIF members,  although  SAIF members will  continue to pay the
         higher FICO payments  described  above.  Management  cannot predict the
         level of FDIC insurance  assessments on an ongoing basis or whether the
         BIF and SAIF will eventually be merged.

(15)  Conversion to Stock Savings Bank
    The  Savings  Bank  successfully  completed  a  conversion  from a federally
         chartered  mutual savings  association to a federally  chartered  stock
         savings  bank on January  4, 1994  pursuant  to the Plan of  Conversion
         adopted by the Savings  Bank's  Board of Directors on June 17, 1993 and
         subsequently  approved  by  regulatory  authorities  and members of the
         Bank.  FFLC  Bancorp,  Inc. was created as the holding  company for the
         Savings Bank as part of this conversion,  generating  proceeds of $23.3
         million (net of shares purchased by the Savings Bank for employee stock
         incentive  plans)  from the sale of  4,603,032  shares  of stock at the
         price of $6 per share in a subscription and community offering.

    The  Plan of  Conversion  provided for the  establishment  of a  Liquidation
         Account  equal  to the  retained  income  of  the  Savings  Bank  as of
         September  30,  1993 (the date of the most recent  financial  statement
         presented in the final conversion prospectus).  The Liquidation Account
         is established to provide a limited priority claim to the assets of the
         Savings  Bank  to  qualifying  depositors  as  of  September  30,  1992
         (Eligible  Account  Holders) who  continue to maintain  deposits in the
         Savings  Bank after  conversion.  In the  unlikely  event of a complete
         liquidation of the Savings Bank, and only in such event,  each Eligible
         Account Holder would receive from the Liquidation Account a liquidation
         distribution  based on  their  proportionate  share  of the then  total
         remaining qualifying deposits.
<PAGE>
    Current  regulations  allow the Savings  Bank to pay  dividends on its stock
         after the  conversion  if its  regulatory  capital would not thereby be
         reduced  below  the  amount  then   required  for  the   aforementioned
         Liquidation Account.  Also, capital distribution  regulations limit the
         Savings  Bank's  ability to make capital  distributions  which  include
         dividends,   stock  redemptions  and  repurchases,   cash-out  mergers,
         interest  payments on certain  convertible debt and other  transactions
         charged  to the  capital  account  based on  their  capital  level  and
         supervisory condition. Federal regulations also preclude any repurchase
         of the stock by the Savings Bank or its holding company for three years
         after  conversion  except  for  purchases  of  qualifying  shares  of a
         director and repurchases  pursuant to an offer made on a pro rata basis
         to all  stockholders  and with prior  approval  of the Office of Thrift
         Supervision or pursuant to an open-market stock repurchase program that
         complies  with  certain  regulatory  criteria.  See  also  Note  18 for
         information regarding the Savings Bank's Stock Repurchase Program.

(16)  Stock Benefit Plans
    During 1996,  the Company  adopted the  provisions of Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation"
        ("SFAS No. 123"). SFAS No. 123 applies to stock-based compensation under
        the Company's  incentive stock option plan (the "Option Plan") and under
        the Company's Recognition and Retention Plan discussed below. As allowed
        by SFAS No. 123, the Company elected to continue to measure compensation
        cost for the  options  or shares  granted  under  either  plan using the
        intrinsic  value method of accounting  prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,
        "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."  SFAS No. 123 does not apply
        to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan discussed below.

    During the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, 18,000,  10,867 and
         8,332  options  were granted  under the Option  Plan,  and 0, 2,014 and
         6,000 shares were awarded under the  Recognition  and  Retention  Plan.
         SFAS No. 123 requires pro forma fair value disclosures if the intrinsic
         value method is being utilized. In order to calculate the fair value of
         the options,  it was assumed that the risk-free  interest rate was 7.0%
         for each period, an annualized dividend yield of approximately 2% would
         apply over the exercise period,  the expected life of the options would
         be the entire  exercise  period and the expected  stock  volatility was
         42%, 23% and 14%,  respectively,  for 1998, 1997 and 1996. For purposes
         of pro forma  disclosures,  the  estimated  fair value was  included in
         expense  in  the  period  vesting  occurs.  The  following  information
         pertains to the options  granted to  purchase  common  stock and shares
         awarded  in  1998,  1997  and  1996 (in  thousands,  except  per  share
         amounts):

         approved the Option Plan.  On January 4, 1994,  upon  conversion of the
         Savings Bank to a stock  association,  stock options for 460,303 common
         shares  were  authorized  to be  granted  to  directors,  officers  and
         employees  of the Savings Bank  including  66,343  shares  reserved for
         future  directors,  officers and  employees.  Shares  granted under the
         Option Plan are  exercisable  at the market price at the date of grant.
         Such  incentive  stock  options  granted to officers and  employees are
         exercisable  in  three  equal  annual  installments,   with  the  first
         installment  becoming  exercisable  one year  from  the date of  grant.
         Options granted to outside directors are exercisable  immediately,  but
         any common shares obtained from exercise of the options may not be sold
         prior to one year from the date of  grant.  All  options  expire at the
         earlier of ten years from the date of grant or one year  following  the
         date which the outside director, officer or employee ceases to serve in
         such capacity. At December 31, 1998, 54,999 shares remain available for
         grant to future directors, officers and employees.

    Employee Stock  Ownership  Plan. The Company  sponsors a leveraged ESOP that
        covers eligible  employees who have a twelve-month  period of employment
        with the Savings  Bank during which they worked at least 1,000 hours and
        who have attained age 21. The Savings Bank makes quarterly contributions
        to the ESOP equal to the ESOP's debt service.  The ESOP Trust  purchased
        368,242 shares of common stock in the Company's  initial public offering
        with the proceeds from a loan from the Company. This loan bears interest
        at a fixed-rate of six percent with  principal  and interest  payable in
        equal quarterly installments over seven years. The ESOP shares initially
        were pledged as collateral  for its debt. As the debt is repaid,  shares
        are released from collateral and allocated to active  employees based on
        the  proportion  of debt  service  paid  during  the year.  The  Company
        accounts for its ESOP in  accordance  with  Statement of Position  93-6.
        Accordingly,  the debt of the ESOP is  recorded  as debt and the cost of
        the  shares  pledged  as  collateral  are  reported  as a contra  equity
        account.  As shares are released from  collateral,  the Company  records
        compensation expense, and an offsetting credit to capital,  equal to the
        current  market price of the shares,  and the shares become  outstanding
        for  earnings per share  computations.  Dividends on all ESOP shares are
        recorded as  compensation  expense as it is  management's  intention  to
        allocate   the   dividends   along  with  the  shares  when   allocated.
        Compensation  expense for the years ended  December 31,  1998,  1997 and
        1996 included the following ESOP related costs:

    Recognition and Retention Plan. The Company  adopted,  and the  shareholders
        approved,  an RRP for  directors,  officers and  employees to enable the
        Savings Bank to attract and retain experienced and capable personnel. On
        January 4, 1994,  the  conversion  date,  184,122 shares of common stock
        were  purchased  for the RRP which  included  8,067 shares  reserved for
        future directors,  officers and employees. The shares are granted in the
        form of restricted stock to be earned in three equal annual installments
        beginning  April 4, 1995.  The RRP shares  purchased  in the  conversion
        initially  were  excluded  from   stockholders'   equity.   The  Company
        recognized  compensation  expense in the amount of the fair market value
        of the common stock at the grant date of $6 per share, pro rata over the
        years  (1996,  1995 and 1994)  during  which the shares  were earned and
        payable  and  recorded a credit to  shareholders'  equity.  Compensation
        expense  attributable  to the RRP amounted to $368,000 in 1996, 1995 and
        1994. No compensation  expense attributable to the RRP was recognized in
        1997  or  1998.  The  shares  are  entitled  to  all  voting  and  other
        shareholder rights, except that the shares, while restricted,  cannot be
        sold,  pledged or otherwise  disposed of, and are required to be held in
        escrow.

    If  a holder of restricted  stock under the RRP  terminated  employment  for
        reasons other than death, disability, retirement or change of control in
        the Company,  such employee  forfeits all rights to any allocated shares
        which  are  still  restricted.   If  termination  is  caused  by  death,
        disability,  retirement  or  change  in  control  of  the  Company,  all
        allocated  shares become  unrestricted.  Forfeitures  are reallocated to
        eligible  participants  annually.  At December  31,  1998,  4,581 shares
        remain reserved for future directors, officers and employees.

(18)  Stock Repurchase Program
    In  December  1994,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  approved  a Stock
        Repurchase  Program  ("Program") which allows the Company to acquire its
        outstanding  common stock in the open market.  The Company  subsequently
        received OTS approval for the  Program,  and began  repurchasing  shares
        early  in  1995.   Under  the  Program,   the  Company  was  limited  to
        repurchasing  no more than 5%, or  approximately  138,000  shares of its
        publicly-held  common stock over a one-year  period  ending  January 16,
        1996.  During the year ended December 31, 1995,  132,044 shares or 95.6%
        of the  maximum  number  of  shares  approved  under  the  Program  were
        repurchased.

    In  January and August  1996,  the  Company's  Board of  Directors  approved
        programs which allow the Company to acquire  additional  common stock in
        the open market.  The Company received OTS approval for the programs and
        began repurchasing shares within one month of approval.  During the year
        ended December 31, 1996,  all 132,000 shares  approved under the January
        1996 program were repurchased.  During the years ended December 31, 1996
        and 1997, all 126,000 shares approved under the August 1996 program were
        repurchased.

    In  January 1997, the Company's Board of Directors  approved a program which
        allows  the  Company  to  acquire  additional  common  stock in the open
        market. During the year ended December 31, 1997, 178,690 shares or 60.6%
        of the 294,928 shares approved under that program were repurchased.

    In  September  1998,  the  Company's  Board of Directors  approved a program
        which allows the Company to acquire 369,285  additional  common stock in
        the open market.  During the year ended December 31, 1998, the remaining
        shares approved under the January 1997 program were repurchased.  During
        the year ended  December 31, 1998 32,025 shares or 8.7% of the September
        1998 program were repurchased.

(20)  Year 2000 Issues
    The Company is acutely  aware of the many  areas  affected  by the Year 2000
        computer  issue,  as  addressed  by the Federal  Financial  Institutions
        Examination  Council  ("FFIEC")  in  its  interagency   statement  which
        provided an outline for  institutions to manage the Year 2000 challenges
        effectively.  A Year  2000  plan  has  been  approved  by the  Board  of
        Directors which includes  multiple  phases,  tasks to be completed,  and
        target  dates  for  completion.  Issues  addressed  in the plan  include
        awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, implementation,  testing,
        and contingency planning.

    The Company  has  formed a Year  2000  committee  that is  charged  with the
        oversight of  completing  the Year 2000 project on a timely  basis.  The
        Company has completed its awareness,  assessment  and renovation  phases
        and is actively involved in validating and implementing its plan. At the
        present time, the Company has substantially completed its testing phase,
        the results of which indicate that the Company's internal systems appear
<PAGE>
        to be Year  2000  ready.  Since  it  routinely  upgrades  and  purchases
        technologically advanced software and hardware on a continual basis, the
        Company has determined that the cost of making  modifications to correct
        any Year 2000  issues  will not  materially  affect  reported  operating
        results.  Management  does not believe  that the Company has incurred or
        will incur material costs associated with the Year 2000 issue.

    The Company's   vendors  and  suppliers  have  been  contacted  for  written
        confirmation  of  their  product  readiness  for Year  2000  compliance.
        Negative or deficient  responses are analyzed and periodically  reviewed
        to prescribe timely actions within the Company's  contingency  planning.
        The Company's main service provider has completed testing of its mission
        critical  application  software and item processing  software;  the test
        results, which have been documented and validated, are deemed to be Year
        2000  compliant.  FFIEC  guidance  on testing  Year 2000  compliance  of
        service  providers  states  that proxy tests are  acceptable  compliance
        tests.   In  proxy   testing,   the  service   provider   tests  with  a
        representative  sample of financial  institutions  that use a particular
        service,  with the results of such  testing  shared  with all  similarly
        situated clients of the service provider. The Company has authorized the
        acceptance of proxy  testing  since the proxy tests have been  conducted
        with financial  institutions  that are similar in type and complexity to
        its own using the same  version of the Year 2000 ready  software and the
        same hardware and operating systems.


                                       49

    The Company also recognizes the importance of determining that its borrowers
        are  facing  the  Year  2000  problem  in  a  timely   manner  to  avoid
        deterioration  of the  loan  portfolio  solely  due to this  issue.  All
        material relationships have been identified and questionnaires have been
        completed to assess the inherent risks.  Deposit customers have received
        statement  stuffers  and  informational  material  in this  regard.  The
        Company  plans to work on a  one-on-one  basis with any borrower who has
        been identified as having high Year 2000 risk exposure.

    Notwithstanding  our actions,  there can be no assurances  that all hardware
        and  software  that the  Company  will use will be Year 2000  compliant.
        Management  cannot predict the amount of financial  difficulties  it may
        incur due to customers  and vendors  inability  to perform  according to
        their  agreements  with the  Company or the  effects  that  other  third
        parties may cause as a result of this issue. Therefore,  there can be no
        assurance  that the  failure or delay of others to address  the issue or
        that the costs involved in such process will not have a material adverse
        effect on the Company's business,  financial  condition,  and results of
        operations.

    Based on testing  results to date (as noted above),  the  Company's  mission
        critical  systems  have been  deemed to be Year 2000 ready.  However,  a
        written  contingency  plan has been  developed to address  problems that
        might  be  caused  from  Year  2000  system  failures.  Testing  of  the
        contingency plan is in progress and is scheduled to be completed by June
        30, 1999.  With regard to non-mission  critical  internal  systems,  the
        Company's  contingency  plans are to replace  those systems that test as
        being  noncompliant.   Alternatively,  some  systems  could  be  handled
        manually on an interim basis.  Should outside  service  providers not be
        able to provide  compliant  systems,  the Company will  terminate  those
        relationships and transfer to other vendors.  It is anticipated that the
        Company's  deposit customers will have increased demands for cash in the
        latter  part of 1999 and,  correspondingly,  the Company  will  maintain
        higher liquidity levels.

                          Independent Auditors' Report



The Board of Directors
FFLC Bancorp, Inc.
Leesburg, Florida:

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of FFLC Bancorp,
Inc. and Subsidiary (the "Company") (the parent company of First Federal Savings
Bank of  Lake  County)  as of  December  31,  1998  and  1997  and  the  related
consolidated statements of income,  stockholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year  period ended December 31, 1998.  These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of the Company as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997 and the results of its  operations and its cash flows
for each of the  years in the  three-year  period  ended  December  31,  1998 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
