ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business

FFLC Bancorp, Inc., ("FFLC" or the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware on
September 16, 1993, and acquired First Federal Savings Bank of Lake County (the
"Bank") in connection with the Bank's conversion to stock form on January 4,
1994. The Company is a savings and loan holding company subject to regulation by
the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") which mainly transacts its business
through its subsidiary, the Bank. At December 31, 2001, the Company had total
assets of $823.2 million and stockholders' equity of $64.1 million.

The Bank was established in 1934 as a federally-chartered mutual savings and
loan association. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB")
System and its deposit accounts are insured to the maximum allowable amount by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). At December 31, 2001, the
Bank had total assets of $822.9 million and stockholders' equity of $60.1
million.

The Bank is a community-oriented savings institution offering a variety of
financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves. The Bank's
deposit gathering and lending markets are primarily concentrated in the
communities surrounding its full service offices located in Lake, Sumter and
Citrus counties in central Florida. Management believes that its offices are
located in communities that generally can be characterized as rural service and
retirement communities with residential neighborhoods comprised predominately of
one-to-four-family residences. The Bank is the largest (by asset size)
locally-based financial institution in Lake County, and serves its market area
with a wide selection of residential mortgage loans and other retail financial
services. Management considers the Bank's reputation for financial strength and
customer service as a major advantage in attracting and retaining customers in
its market area and believes it benefits from its community orientation as well
as its established deposit base and level of core deposits.

During 2001, First Alliance Title, L.L.C., a 90% owned subsidiary of the
Company, was formed to facilitate the sale of title insurance. This subsidiary
had only a minimal amount of activity during 2001.

Market Area and Competition

The Bank is a community-oriented savings institution offering a variety of
financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves. The Bank's
deposit gathering and lending markets are primarily concentrated in the
communities surrounding its full service offices located in Lake, Sumter and
Citrus counties in central Florida. The Bank's competition for loans comes
principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, and mortgage banking
companies. The Bank's most direct competition for savings has historically come
from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions. The Bank faces
additional competition for savings from money-market mutual funds and other
corporate and government securities funds. The Bank also faces increased
competition for deposits from other financial intermediaries such as securities
brokerage firms and insurance companies.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest-rate risk inherent in
its lending and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively
monitors and manages its interest-rate risk exposure. The measurement of market
risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related
and offsetting on- and off-balance-sheet transactions are aggregated, and the
resulting net positions are identified. Disclosures about the fair value of
financial instruments, which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's primary objective in managing interest-rate risk is to minimize
the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the Bank's net interest
income and capital, and to adjust the Company's asset-liability structure to
obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. The Company relies
primarily on its asset-liability management to control interest-rate risk.
However, a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely
impact the Company's earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

Lending Activities

Loan Portfolio. The Bank's loan portfolio consists primarily of conventional
first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family residences. At December 31,
2001, the Bank's total gross loans outstanding were $703.9 million, of which
$413.7 million or 58.77% of the Bank's total loan portfolio were
one-to-four-family residential first mortgage loans. Of the one-to-four-family
residential mortgage loans outstanding at that date, approximately 36% were
fixed rate loans and 64% were adjustable-rate ("ARM") loans. At the same date,
commercial real estate loans and other loans on improved real estate totaled
$108.8 million, or 15.46% of the Bank's total loan portfolio; construction
(excluding construction/permanent loans) and land loans totaled $23.0 million or
3.26% of the Bank's total loan portfolio; and multi-family mortgage loans
totaled $20.3 million or 2.88% of the Bank's total loan portfolio. Consumer,
commercial and other loans held by the Bank, which principally consist of home
equity loans, deposit, consumer, commercial and other loans, totaled $138.1
million or 19.63% of the Bank's total loan portfolio at December 31, 2001.

Purchase of Mortgage Loans. From time to time, the Bank purchases mortgage loans
originated by other lenders. At December 31, 2001, $4.6 million, or .65% of the
Bank's total loan portfolio consisted of purchased mortgage loans or loan
participations. Purchased or participated mortgage loans consist of
one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans.

Secondary Market Activities. The Bank participates in the secondary market
through a correspondent relationship, originating loans (primarily 30-year
fixed-rate loans) which are funded by the investor correspondent. Funding by the
correspondent eliminates the Bank's interest-rate risk on such loans. Such loans
are closed on the Bank's documents with funds provided by the investor
correspondent at closing with all credit conditions established by the investor
correspondent being satisfied prior to the issuance of a loan commitment. The
Bank receives a fee for originating, processing and closing the loans and
reports the loans to the OTS as loans originated and sold. In the year ended
December 31, 2001, such loans amounted to $14.9 million or 11.28% of total
mortgage loans originated.

Loan Originations, Sales and Principal Repayments. The following table sets
forth the Bank's loan originations, sales and principal repayments for the
periods indicated.

One-to-Four-Family Mortgage Lending. The Bank's primary residential lending
emphasis is on the origination of first mortgage loans secured by
one-to-four-family residences within its primary lending area. Such residences
are primarily single family homes, including condominium and townhouses, that
serve as the primary residence of the owner. To a lesser degree, the Bank makes
loans on residences used as second homes or as investments. The Bank also offers
second mortgage loans which are underwritten applying the same standards as for
first mortgage loans.

In the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Bank's total mortgage
loan originations, including loans purchased or participated, amounted to $154.2
million, $123.4 million and $132.3 million, respectively, of which $136.5
million, $106.2 million and $102.0 million, respectively, were secured by
one-to-four-family properties.

At December 31, 2001, 58.77% of total loans consisted of one-to-four-family
residential loans, of which approximately 64% were ARM loans. The Bank's ARM
loans may carry an initial interest rate which is less than the fully indexed
rate for the loan. The initial discounted rate is determined by the Bank in
accordance with market and competitive factors. The Bank offers one-, three-,
and five-year ARM loans which adjust by a maximum of 2% per adjustment period,
with lifetime caps on increases of 5% to 6%, depending upon the program chosen.

The Bank's policy on one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans generally is
to lend up to 80% of the appraised value of property securing the loan, or up to
95% if private mortgage insurance is obtained on the amount of the loan which
exceeds 80%.

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending. As of December 31, 2001, $108.8
million, or 15.46% of the Bank's total loan portfolio consisted of commercial
real estate loans and $20.3 million, or 2.88% of the Bank's total loan
portfolio, consisted of multi-family mortgage loans.

The commercial real estate loans in the Bank's portfolio consist of fixed-rate
and ARM loans which were originated at prevailing market rates. The Bank's
policy has been to originate commercial or multi-family loans only in its
primary market area. Commercial and multi-family mortgage loans are generally
made in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property. In making such
loans, the Bank primarily considers the net operating income generated by the
real estate to support the debt service, the financial resources and income
level and managerial expertise of the borrower, the marketability of the
property and the Bank's lending experience with the borrower.

Commercial Loans. As of December 31, 2001, $18.8 million or 2.67% of the Bank's
total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans.

Construction and Land Loans. The Bank originates loans to finance the
construction of one-to-four-family homes and, to a much lesser extent,
originates loans for the acquisition and development of land (either unimproved
land or improved lots) on which the purchaser can then build. At December 31,
2001, construction (excluding construction/permanent loans) and land loans
totaled $23.0 million or 3.26% of the Bank's total loan portfolio.

At December 31, 2001, the Bank had loans in process (undisbursed loan proceeds
of construction loans) of $14.3 million which were mainly secured by residential
mortgages. The Bank makes residential construction loans to homeowners on a
long-term basis with amortization beginning at the conclusion of construction,
usually a period of about six months. Such loans are carried in the
one-to-four-family category and are not separately classified as construction
loans. Residential construction loans to builders are carried in the
construction and land category.


                                       8
<PAGE>



Construction and land loans also include construction loans for
one-to-four-family residential property for which the borrower will obtain
permanent financing from another lender. Such loans bear a fixed rate of
interest that equals prime plus 1.0% during the construction period. The Bank
obtains a commitment for the permanent financing from the other lender prior to
originating the construction loan.

Consumer Lending. At December 31, 2001, $119.4 million or 16.96% of the Bank's
total loan portfolio consisted of consumer loans, including home equity loans of
$34.0 million, lines of credit of $11.9 million, direct auto and truck loans of
$15.3 million, indirect auto and truck loans of $24.7 million, home improvement
loans and other secured consumer loans of $18.5 million, lot loans of $14.1
million and unsecured personal loans of $.9 million.


The Bank's home equity loans are originated on one-to-four-family residences,
either on a fixed-rate basis with terms of up to 15 years or as balloon loans
with terms up to five years with fifteen year amortization periods. Those loans
are generally limited to aggregate outstanding indebtedness on the property
securing the loan of 90% of the loan to value ratio. The Bank also offers home
equity lines of credit, which bear prime-based adjustable interest rates with
terms up to fifteen years. Such loans generally require monthly payments of
interest plus 1.5% of the balance outstanding.

Consumer loans are offered primarily on a fixed-rate, short-term basis. Except
for second mortgage loans which are underwritten pursuant to the standards
applicable to one-to-four-family residential loans, the underwriting standards
employed by the Bank for consumer loans include a determination of the
applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of the borrower's
ability to make payments on the proposed loan and other indebtedness.

Loan Approval and Authority. Loan approval authority for loans exceeding
$1,600,000 is vested in the Executive Committee of the Board which meets weekly
to consider loan recommendations of the Loan Committee. The Loan Committee is
comprised of three outside directors, the President and the Senior Lending
Officers of the Bank and has been delegated authority to approve mortgage loans,
commercial loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and secured
consumer loans up to $1,600,000.

The Bank's policy is to require title and hazard insurance on all real estate
loans, except home equity loans for which a title search is conducted in lieu of
obtaining title insurance. Borrowers may be permitted to pay real estate taxes
and hazard insurance premiums applicable to the secured property for a mortgage
loan. In some instances, borrowers may be required to advance funds together
with each payment of principal and interest to a mortgage escrow account from
which the Bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes, hazard
insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums.

Asset Quality

Delinquent Loans and Nonperforming Assets. Loans are generally placed on
nonaccrual status when the collection of principal or interest is 90 days or
more past due, or earlier if collection is deemed uncertain. The Bank provides
an allowance for accrued interest deemed uncollectible. Accrued interest
receivable is reported net of the allowance for uncollected interest. Loans may
be reinstated to accrual status when all payments are brought current and, in
the opinion of management, collection of the remaining balance can be reasonably
expected.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations and the Bank's policy require the
classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities,
considered to be of lesser quality as "substandard", "doubtful" or "loss"
assets. An asset is considered "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by
the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral
pledged, if any. "Substandard" assets include those characterized by the
"distinct possibility" that the institution will sustain "some loss" if the
deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the
weaknesses inherent in those classified "substandard," with the added
characteristic that the weaknesses present make "collection or liquidation in
full", on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, "highly
questionable and improbable." Assets classified as "loss" are those considered
"uncollectible" and of such little value that their continuance as assets
without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. In
addition, the Bank's policies require that assets which do not currently expose
the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification as
substandard but possess other weaknesses are designated "special mention" by
management.



                                       11
<PAGE>


If an asset is classified, the estimated fair value of the asset is determined
and if that value is less than the then carrying value of the asset, the
difference is established as a specific reserve. If an asset is classified as
loss, the amount of the asset classified as loss is reserved. General reserves
or general valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been
established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities
but, unlike specific reserves, are not allocated to particular assets.

The following table sets forth information concerning the number and dollar
amount of loans and real estate owned classified as "special mention" or
"substandard" at the dates indicated. No loans or real estate owned were
classified "doubtful" or "loss" at those dates.

Allowance for Loan Losses. The Bank's allowance for loan losses is established
and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on management's
evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and the condition of the
local economy in the Bank's market area. Such evaluation, which includes a
review of all loans on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured,
considers, among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying
collateral, economic and regulatory conditions, and other factors that warrant
recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance. Although
management believes it uses the best information available to make
determinations with respect to the Bank's allowance for loan losses, future
adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions vary substantially from the
economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations
or if other circumstances change.

Investment Activities

The investment policy of the Bank, which is established by the Board of
Directors and implemented by the Chief Executive Officer who is designated as
the Investment Officer, is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity,
to generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest
rate and credit risk, and to complement the Bank's lending activities. In
establishing its investment strategies, the Bank considers its business and
growth plans, the economic environment, the types of securities to be held and
other factors. Federally chartered savings institutions have the authority to
invest in various types of assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations,
securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of
insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers acceptances, repurchase
agreements, loans on federal funds, and, subject to certain limits, commercial
paper and mutual funds.

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115. That
statement requires investment and mortgage-backed securities that the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity to be classified as
held-to-maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. Securities that are
held principally for selling in the near term are to be classified as trading
securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included
in earnings. Securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or
trading securities are to be classified as available-for-sale securities and
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings
and reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity.

The Company adopted FAS 133 effective July 1, 1999. As allowed by this standard,
the Company reclassified all securities held to maturity with a book value of
$14,784,000 and a market value of $14,969,000 to available for sale on July 1,
1999.

Mortgage-Backed Securities

The Company's mortgage-backed securities consist of securities issued by the
Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") and the Federal National Mortgage Association
("FNMA"). These mortgage-backed securities totaled $10.9 million or 18.3% of
total securities.

The following table sets forth mortgage-backed security purchases, sales,
amortization and principal repayments during the periods indicated:

Sources of Funds

General. Repayments and maturities of mortgage-backed and investment securities,
loan repayments, deposits and cash flows generated from operations are the
primary sources of the Bank's funds for use in lending, investing and for other
general purposes.

Deposits. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of
interest rates and terms. The Bank's deposits consist of regular savings,
non-interest-bearing checking, NOW checking, money market and certificate
accounts. Of the deposit accounts at December 31, 2001, $44.3 million or 7.6%
consist of individual retirement accounts ("IRAs").

The Bank seeks to retain core deposits consisting of passbook and statement
savings, money market, noninterest-bearing checking, and NOW accounts, which
contribute to a low cost of funds. Such core deposits represented 25.5%, 22.9%
and 25.7% of total deposits at December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

The following table shows the distribution of the Bank's deposits by type at the

Borrowings

The Bank is authorized to obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank
("FHLB") of Atlanta which are generally collateralized by a blanket lien against
the Bank's mortgage portfolio. Such advances may be made pursuant to several
different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of
maturities. The maximum amount that the FHLB of Atlanta will advance to member
institutions, including the Bank, for purposes other than meeting withdrawals,
fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the Federal
Housing Finance Board and the FHLB of Atlanta. At December 31, 2001, the Bank
had $154.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding.

The Bank also borrows under retail repurchase agreements with customers of the
Bank. These agreements are accounted for as borrowings and are secured by
securities owned by the Bank.

The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Bank's
borrowings at the dates indicated:

Subsidiary Activities

The Bank has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Lake County Service Corporation
("LCSC"), formed to develop a 100-lot subdivision. LCSC sold the last remaining
lots during 2001. During 1999, LCSC sold an 8.4 acre commercial parcel and a
one-acre lot that adjoins the Bank's main office. The gain on the sale of the
commercial property was $552,000 after tax and $886,000 before tax. During 1999,
LCSC purchased two commercial building sites for possible future bank branches
and purchased an existing branch building in Inverness, which was rented to the
Bank as a branch site. The Inverness branch property was transferred to the Bank
in 2000.

During the second quarter of 2001, the Bank introduced an Investment Services
Program through a joint venture with T.H.E. Financial Group, Ltd., an
independent securities broker-dealer firm and a member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers and the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation. Through this program, the Bank offers mutual funds, annuities,
discount brokerage and financial planing services to bank customers. The
services are offered through LCSC, which receives monthly fees on sales made
through this program. During 2001, LCSC recognized fees of $114,000 and expenses
of $123,000 (including $37,000 of initial start-up costs) from this program.

During  2001,  First  Alliance  Title,  L.L.C.,  a 90% owned  subsidiary  of the
Company,  was formed to facilitate the sale of title insurance.  This subsidiary
did not have a material amount of activity during 2001.

Personnel

As of February 13, 2002, the Bank had 194 full-time employees and 19 part-time
employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and
the Bank considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

General

As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is required by federal law to
file reports with, and otherwise comply with, the rules and regulations of the
OTS. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by
the OTS, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the deposit insurer.
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and, with respect to
deposit insurance, of the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") managed by
the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the OTS and the FDIC concerning its
activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals
prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or
acquisitions of, other savings institutions. The OTS and/or the FDIC conduct
periodic examinations to test the Bank's safety and soundness and compliance
with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision
establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can
engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and
depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities
extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement
activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the
classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves
for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and
policies, whether by the OTS, the FDIC or the Congress, could have a material
adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations. Certain of the
regulatory requirements applicable to the Bank and to the Company are referred
to below or elsewhere herein. The description of statutory provisions and
regulations applicable to savings institutions and their holding companies set
forth in this Form 10-K does not purport to be a complete description of such
statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company.

Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a nondiversified unitary savings and loan holding company within
the meaning of federal law. Under prior law, a unitary savings and loan holding
company, such as the Company was not generally restricted as to the types of
business activities in which it may engage, provided that the Bank continued to
be a qualified thrift lender. See "Federal Savings Institution Regulation - QTL
Test." The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 provides that no company may acquire
control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the
financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or
for multiple savings and loan holding companies as described below. Further, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act specifies that existing savings and loan holding
companies may only engage in such activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,
however, grandfathered the unrestricted authority for activities with respect to
unitary savings and loan holding companies existing prior to May 4, 1999, such
as the Company, so long as the Bank continues to comply with the QTL Test. Upon
any non-supervisory acquisition by the Company of another savings institution or
Bank that meets



                                       22
<PAGE>

the qualified thrift lender test and is deemed to be a savings institution by
the OTS, the Company would become a multiple savings and loan holding company
(if the acquired institution is held as a separate subsidiary) and would
generally be limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under
Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval
of the OTS, and certain activities authorized by OTS regulation.

A savings and loan holding company is prohibited from, directly or indirectly,
acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or
savings and loan holding company, without prior written approval of the OTS and
from acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not
insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire
savings institutions, the OTS considers the financial and managerial resources
and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the
acquisition on the risk to the deposit insurance funds, the convenience and
needs of the community and competitive factors.

The OTS may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings
and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one
state, subject to two exceptions: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory
acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a
savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target
savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in
the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company
acquisitions.

Although savings and loan holding companies are not subject to specific capital
requirements or specific restrictions on the payment of dividends or other
capital distributions, federal regulations do prescribe such restrictions on
subsidiary savings institutions as described below. The Bank must notify the OTS
30 days before declaring any dividend to the Company. In addition, the financial
impact of a holding company on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is
evaluated by the OTS and the agency has authority to order cessation of
activities or divestiture of subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety
and soundness of the institution.

Federal Savings Institution Regulation

Business Activities. The activities of federal savings institutions are governed
by federal law and regulations. These laws and regulations delineate the nature
and extent of the activities in which federal associations may engage. In
particular, many types of lending authority for federal association, e.g.,
commercial, non-residential real property loans and consumer loans, are limited
to a specified percentage of the institution's capital or assets.

Capital Requirements. The OTS capital regulations require savings institutions
to meet three minimum capital standards: a 1.5% tangible capital ratio, a 4%
leverage ratio (3% for institutions receiving the highest rating on the CAMELS
rating system) and an 8% risk-based capital ratio. In addition, the prompt
corrective action standards discussed below also establish, in effect, a minimum
2% tangible capital standard, a 4% leverage ratio (3% for institutions receiving
the highest rating on the CAMEL financial institution rating system), and,
together with the risk-based capital standard itself, a 4% Tier 1 risk-based
capital standard. The OTS regulations also require that, in meeting the
tangible, leverage and risk-based capital standards, institutions must generally
deduct investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities as
principal that are not permissible for a national bank.

The risk-based capital standard for savings institutions requires the
maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital
and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 4% and 8%,
respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets,
including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight

                                       23
<PAGE>

factor of 0% to 100%, assigned by the OTS capital regulation based on the risks
believed inherent in the type of asset. Core (Tier 1) capital is defined as
common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, and minority interests in equity
accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain
mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships.

The components of supplementary capital currently include cumulative preferred
stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities,
subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the allowance for loan and
lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45%
of unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily
determinable fair market values. Overall, the amount of supplementary capital
included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital.

The capital regulations also incorporate an interest rate risk component.
Savings institutions with "above normal" interest rate risk exposure are subject
to a deduction from total capital for purposes of calculating their risk-based
capital requirements. For the present time, the OTS has deferred implementation
of the interest rate risk capital charge. At December 31, 2001, the Bank met
each of its capital requirements.

The following table presents the Bank's capital position at December 31, 2001.

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. The OTS is required to take certain
supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which
depends upon the institution's degree of undercapitalization. Generally, a
savings institution that has a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of
less than 8%, a ratio of Tier 1 (core) capital to risk-weighted assets of less
than 4% or a ratio of core capital to total assets of less than 4% (3% or less
for institutions with the highest examination rating) is considered to be
"undercapitalized." A savings institution that has a total risk-based capital
ratio less than 6%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage ratio
that is less than 3% is considered to be "significantly undercapitalized" and a
savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less
than 2% is deemed to be "critically undercapitalized." Subject to a narrow
exception, the OTS is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for an
institution that is "critically undercapitalized." The regulation also provides
that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OTS within 45 days of the
date a savings institution receives notice that it is "undercapitalized,"
"significantly undercapitalized" or "critically undercapitalized." Compliance
with the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company. In addition,
numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an
undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased
monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and
expansion. The OTS could also take any one of a number of discretionary
supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the
replacement of senior executive officers and directors.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank is a member of the SAIF. The FDIC
maintains a risk-based assessment system by which institutions are assigned to
one of three categories based on their capitalization and one of three
subcategories based on examination ratings and other supervisory information. An

                                       24
<PAGE>

institution's assessment rate depends upon the categories to which it is
assigned. Assessment rates for SAIF member institutions are determined
semiannually by the FDIC and currently range from zero basis points for the
healthiest institutions to 27 basis points for the riskiest.

In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are required
to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation
("FICO") to recapitalize the predecessor to the SAIF. By law, there has been
equal sharing of FICO payments between SAIF and BIF members since January 1,
2000.

The Bank did not pay an assessment for deposit insurance in 2001, however, its
payments toward the FICO bonds amounted to $99,000. The FDIC has authority to
increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in SAIF insurance
premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and
results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance
assessment rates will be in the future.

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the
institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or
unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law,
regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the OTS. The
management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation
that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

Loans to One Borrower. Federal law provides that savings institutions are
generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national
banks. A savings institution may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or
related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and
surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital
and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral. At December
31, 2001, the Bank's limit on loans to one borrower was $9.4 million and the
Bank's largest aggregate outstanding loans and extensions of credit to one
borrower was $8.4 million.

QTL Test. The HOLA requires savings institutions to meet a qualified thrift
lender test. Under the test, a savings association is required to either qualify
as a "domestic building and loan association" under the Internal Revenue Code or
maintain at least 65% of its "portfolio assets" (total assets less: (i)
specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including
goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain
"qualified thrift investments" (primarily residential mortgages and related
investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities) in at least 9 months
out of each 12 month period.

A savings institution that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to
certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a bank charter.
As of December 31, 2001, the Bank maintained 84% of its portfolio assets in
qualified thrift investments and, therefore, met the qualified thrift lender
test. Recent legislation has expanded the extent to which education loans,
credit card loans and small business loans may be considered "qualified thrift
investments."

Limitation on Capital Distributions. OTS regulations impose limitations upon all
capital distributions by a savings institution, including cash dividends,
payments to repurchase its shares and payments to shareholders of another
institution in a cash-out merger. Under a new regulation effective April 1,
1999, an application to and the prior approval of the OTS is required prior to
any capital distribution if the institution does not meet the criteria for
"expedited treatment" of applications under OTS regulations (i.e., generally,
examination ratings in the two top categories), the total capital distributions
for the calendar year exceed net income for that year plus the amount of
retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would be
undercapitalized following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise

                                       25
<PAGE>

be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with OTS. If an application is
not required, the institution must still provide prior notice to OTS of the
capital distribution if, like the Bank, it is a subsidiary of a holding company.
In the event the Bank's capital fell below its regulatory requirements or the
OTS notified it that it was in need of more than normal supervision, the Bank's
ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the OTS
could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution, which would
otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the OTS determines that such
distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

Assessments. Savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the OTS to
fund the agency's operations. The general assessments, paid on a semi-annual
basis, are computed upon the savings institution's total assets, including
consolidated subsidiaries, as reported in the Bank's latest quarterly thrift
financial report. The Bank was assessed $140,602 for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2001.

Transactions with Related Parties. The Bank's authority to engage in
transactions with "affiliates" (e.g., any company that controls or is under
common control with an institution, including the Company and its non-savings
institution subsidiaries) is limited by federal law. The aggregate amount of
covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the
capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered
transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings institution's
capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be
secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in federal law. The
purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. The
transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, that are
at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings
institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in
activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings
institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a
subsidiary.




                                       26
<PAGE>


The Bank's authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10%
shareholders ("insiders"), as well as entities such persons control, is also
governed by federal law. Such loans are required to be made on terms
substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not
involve more than the normal risk of repayment. Recent legislation created an
exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is
widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give
preference to insiders over other employees. The law limits both the individual
and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on
the Bank's capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be
followed.

Enforcement. The OTS has primary enforcement responsibility over savings
institutions and has the authority to bring actions against the institution and
all institution-affiliated parties, including stockholders, and any attorneys,
appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful
action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal
enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease
and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors to institution of
receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil
penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or
even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. The FDIC has the
authority to recommend to the Director of the OTS that enforcement action to be
taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken
by the Director, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain
circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain
violations.

Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking agencies have adopted
Interagency Guidelines prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The
guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking
agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions
before capital becomes impaired. If the OTS determines that a savings
institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OTS may
require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with
the standard.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") System, which
consists of 12 regional FHLBs. The FHLB provides a central credit facility
primarily for member institutions. In order to borrow from the FHLB, the Bank is
required to purchase shares of the FHLB's nonmarketable equity securities at
par. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to acquire and hold shares
of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount at least equal to 1.0% of the
aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar
obligations at the beginning of each year, or 1/20 of its advances (borrowings)
from the FHLB, whichever is greater. The Bank was in compliance with this
requirement with an investment in FHLB stock at December 31, 2001 of $7.7
million. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the dividend yield on FHLB stock
was 6.75%.

The FHLBs are required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent thrifts
in the late 1980s and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs. These
requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the FHLBs pay to their
members and could also result in the FHLBs imposing a higher rate of interest on
advances to their members. If dividends were reduced, or interest on future FHLB
advances increased, the Bank's net interest income would likely also be reduced.
Recent legislation has changed the structure of the FHLBs funding obligations
for insolvent thrifts, revised the capital structure of the FHLBs and
implemented entirely voluntary membership for FHLBs. Management cannot predict
the effect that these changes may have with respect to its FHLB membership.

Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings institutions to maintain
non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW
and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves
be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for accounts
aggregating $41.3 million or less (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve
Board) the reserve requirement is 3%; and for accounts aggregating greater than
$41.3 million, the reserve requirement is $1.239 million plus 10% (subject to
adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board between 8% and 14%) against that portion
of total transaction accounts in excess of $41.3 million. The first $5.7 million
of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve
Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. At December 31, 2001, the
Bank complied with the foregoing requirements.

Community Reinvestment Act

Under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), as implemented by Office of Thrift
Supervision regulations, a savings association has a continuing and affirmative
obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit
needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.
The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for
financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop
the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its
particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the Office of
Thrift Supervision, in connection with its examination of an institution, to
assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and
to take such record into account in its evaluation of applications by such
institution. The CRA requires public disclosure of an institution's CRA rating.
The latest CRA rating of the Bank received from the Office of Thrift Supervision
was "Satisfactory."

Federal and State Taxation

General. The Company and the Bank report their income on a consolidated basis
using the accrual method of accounting, and are subject to federal income
taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions,
including particularly the Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed below. The
following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not
purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the
Bank or the Company. The Bank was last audited by the IRS for the year ended
December 31, 1996. For its 2001 taxable year, the Bank is subject to a maximum
federal income tax rate of 34%.

Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning prior to December 31, 1995, thrift
institutions which qualified under certain definitional tests and other
conditions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") were permitted to
use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable
income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be
established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans (generally secured
by interests in real property improved or to be improved) under (i) the
Percentage of Taxable Income Method (the "PTI Method") or (ii) the Experience
Method. The reserve for nonqualifying loans was computed using the Experience
Method.

The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), which was
enacted on August 20, 1996, requires savings institutions to recapture (i.e.,
take into income) certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. The
1996 Act repeals the reserve method of accounting for bad debts effective for
tax years beginning after 1995. Thrift institutions that would be treated as
small banks are allowed to utilize the Experience Method applicable to such
institutions, while thrift institutions that are treated as large banks (those
generally exceeding $500 million in assets) are required to use only the
specific charge-off method. Thus, the PTI Method of accounting for bad debts is
no longer available for any financial institution.

A thrift institution required to change its method of computing reserves for bad
debts will treat such change as a change in method of accounting, initiated by
the taxpayer, and having been made with the consent of the IRS. Any Section
481(a) adjustment required to be taken into income with respect to such change
generally will be taken into income ratably over a six-taxable year period,
beginning with the first taxable year beginning after 1995, subject to the
residential loan requirement.

Under the residential loan requirement provision, the recapture required by the
1996 Act is suspended for each of two successive taxable years, beginning with
1996, in which the Bank originates a minimum of certain residential loans based
upon the average of the principal amounts of such loans made by the Bank during
its six taxable years preceding its current taxable year. Under the 1996 Act,
for its current and future taxable years, the Bank is permitted to make
additions to its tax bad debt reserves. In addition, the Bank is required to
recapture (i.e., take into income) over a six year period the excess of the
balance of its tax bad debt reserves as of December 31, 1995 over the balance of
such reserves as of December 31, 1987. At December 31, 2001, the Bank had
approximately $262,000 of deferred tax liabilities recorded for the recapture of
its bad debt reserves.



                                       29
<PAGE>


Distributions. Under the 1996 Act, if the Bank makes "non-dividend
distributions" to the Company, such distributions will be considered to have
been made from the Bank's unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves (including the
balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987) to the extent thereof, and then
from the Bank's supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent thereof,
and an amount based on the amount distributed (but not in excess of the amount
of such reserves) will be included in the Bank's income. Non-dividend
distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank's current and
accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes,
distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete
liquidation. Dividends paid out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings
and profits will not be so included in the Bank's income.



The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount
that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount
of the distribution. Thus, if the Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to the
Company, approximately one and one-half times the amount of such distribution
(but not in excess of the amount of such reserves) would be includable in income
for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 35% federal corporate income tax
rate. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture
of any portion of its bad debt reserves.

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. The Code imposes a tax on alternative minimum
taxable income ("AMTI") at a rate of 20%. For fiscal years beginning prior to
January 1, 1996, the excess of the bad debt reserve deduction using the
percentage of taxable income method over the deduction that would have been
allowable under the experience method is treated as a preference item for
purposes of computing the AMTI. Only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating
loss carryovers. The adjustment to AMTI based on book income is an amount equal
to 75% of the amount by which a corporation's adjusted current earnings exceeds
its AMTI (determined without regard to this adjustment and prior to reduction
for net operating losses). In addition, for taxable years through 1995, an
environmental tax of .12% of the excess of AMTI (with certain modifications)
over $2.0 million is imposed on corporations, including the Bank, whether or not
an Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT") is paid. The Bank does not expect to be
subject to the AMT.

Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters. The Company may exclude from its
income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same
affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is
generally 70% in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations
with which the Company and the Bank will not file a consolidated tax return,
except that if the Company and the Bank own more than 20% of the stock of a
corporation distributing a dividend, 80% of any dividends received may be
deducted.

Florida Taxation. The Bank files Florida franchise tax returns. For Florida
franchise tax purposes, savings institutions are presently taxed at a rate equal
to 5.5% of taxable income. For this purpose, "taxable income" generally means
federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments (including the addition
of interest income on State and municipal obligations). The Bank is not
currently under audit with respect to its Florida franchise tax returns.

                                   OUR MISSION


Our mission is to operate First Federal Savings Bank as a community bank, in a
manner consistent with the high expectations of our shareholders, customers and
employees. We will achieve attractive financial results for our stockholders,
provide quality financial services and products to our customers, and offer
rewarding careers to our employees, while maintaining a high level of personal
service and integrity. The Company's primary goals are to: provide an attractive
return to its shareholders, as measured by long-term capital appreciation and
the continued payment of reasonable dividends; provide a competitive,
progressive and profitable array of financial services and products in a manner
focused on excellent customer service; attract and retain highly-motivated,
top-quality employees; and make a positive impact on the communities that we
serve.


                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 evidences Congress'
determination that the disclosure of forward-looking information is desirable
for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for
forward-looking statements by corporate management. This Annual Report,
including the Letter to Stockholders and the Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains
forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. In order to comply
with the terms of the safe harbor, the Company notes that a variety of factors
could cause the Company's actual results and experience to differ materially
from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the Company's
forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the
operations, performance, development, growth projections and results of the
Company's business include, but are not limited to, the growth of the economy,
interest rate movements, timely development by the Company of technology
enhancements for its products and operating systems, the impact of competitive
products, services and pricing, customer business requirements, Congressional
legislation and similar matters. Readers of this report are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which are subject to
influence by the named risk factors and unanticipated future events. Actual
results, accordingly, may differ materially from management expectations.

Dear Stockholders:

I am pleased to report that the year 2001 was a solid year for your Company. We
enjoyed a successful year, both in terms of the growth of the Bank and in
operating earnings. During 2001, we again experienced record net income from
operations, and increased quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. First
Federal Savings Bank, the Company's subsidiary, set a new record for total
assets, ending the year with total assets in excess of $823 million. Our success
results from a team effort, and I want to take this opportunity to thank all of
you - our employees, our stockholders, our customers, and our communities - for
your efforts and support as we moved through 2001 and into 2002.

The Company's net income from operations increased 18%, from $5.3 million in
2000 to $6.3 million in 2001. On a per share basis, basic income increased 18%
from $1.50 per share for 2000 to $1.77 for 2001. On a diluted basis, net income
per share increased 18% from $1.46 for 2000 to $1.73 for 2001.

In January 2002, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the quarterly
cash dividend, to $.14 per common share from the $.13 per common share paid for
the prior four quarters. That increase continues the practice of annual
increases in effect since 1994, when the quarterly cash dividend was $.036 per
common share (adjusted for the five-for-three stock split in November 1997).

In July 2000, we introduced our Internet banking solution, First Federal Online
Banking. I am very pleased to report that First Federal Online Banking has
continued to enjoy support from both our retail and commercial customers, and
enrollments have exceeded our expectations. We currently have over 1,800
registered users of our online banking service. If you haven't had a chance to
check out First Federal Online Banking, I encourage you to visit our website,
1stfederal.com, and click the "Test Drive" button. I believe you will be
pleasantly surprised at how easily and completely you can check account
balances, transfer funds, pay bills, and access cash management services (for
commercial customers) on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis. While you are at
our website, I also encourage you to note all the other useful information,
including our loan and deposit products, links to our press releases and
financial reports, local weather, and links to some other "local-interest"
websites.

During 2001, First Federal also began offering mutual funds, annuities, discount
brokerage and financial planning services. These investment, retirement and
financial planning services are being offered through a joint venture program
with T.H.E. Financial Group, Ltd., an independent securities broker-dealer firm,
and member of the NASD and SIPC.

With regard to our plans for continued growth, I am pleased to report that the
Bank has begun construction on a new branch building at the Lake Harris Square
shopping center, at the intersection of U.S. 27 and State Road 48 in Leesburg.
That branch facility will replace a leased storefront branch opened in 1997,
which has outgrown its current space. We also have purchased an outparcel in the
new Kings Ridge Shopping Center in Clermont, for construction of a full-service
branch. And, we are exploring opportunities for other branch locations that may
become available due to recent bank mergers.

Asset growth continues to be an important focal point for the Company. The
Company's total assets grew 16%, from $711 million at December 31, 2000 to $823
million at December 31, 2001. During 2001, total loans receivable grew 12%, from
$630 million to $704 million. During 2001, the Bank's loan originations totaled
$257.9 million, compared to $220.1 million in 2000. Originations of residential
loans were $102.4 million, commercial loans were $80.2 million, and consumer
loans were $75.3 million for 2001. Those volume levels compare to $106.4
million, $47.9 million, and $65.8 million, respectively, for 2000.

The Company's asset growth was funded by a $66 million increase in the Bank's
deposits, a $31 million increase in Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and $10.1
million provided from operations. During 2001, the Bank's deposits grew from
$519 million to $585 million, an increase of 13%. Of the total increase in
deposits, checking and other non-certificate accounts grew $30 million (or 26%),
while certificates of deposit grew $35 million (or 9%).

I am also pleased to report that the FFLC Bancorp Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(the "Plan") established in January 2000, has been a success, with over 280
shareholders participating. The Plan allows registered stockholders of at least
50 shares of common stock to reinvest regular dividends on all or a portion of
their common stock into additional shares. The Plan also allows participants to
make optional cash purchases of common stock. The Company pays the
administrative costs of the Plan, including brokerage commissions for
reinvestment and optional cash purchases. If you would like more information
about the Plan, please contact us.

It is gratifying to note that our stock price rose over 39% during 2001, from
$14.81 to $20.75. Since our initial public offering in 1994, our stock has
yielded an average annual return, including dividends, of 19.23%. We remain
convinced that our best strategy for creating long-term value to our
stockholders is to focus on profitability and excellence in customer service.

We truly appreciate the loyalty and support of our stockholders, our customers,
and our employees. We remain committed to increasing the long-term value of our
Company. That commitment includes meeting the investment needs of our
stockholders, the financial needs of our customers, and the needs of the
communities in which we have the privilege to serve. We believe FFLC Bancorp,
Inc., is well positioned to meet those needs, and we look forward to the
opportunities before us.

Cordially yours,



Stephen T. Kurtz
President and Chief Executive Officer

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

First Federal Savings Bank of Lake County, the subsidiary of FFLC, was organized
in 1934 as a federally chartered savings and loan association and converted to a
federally chartered stock savings bank on January 4, 1994. The Bank's principal
business continues to be attracting retail deposits from the general public and
investing those deposits, together with principal repayments on loans and
investments and funds generated from operations, primarily in mortgage loans
secured by one-to-four-family, owner-occupied homes, commercial loans, consumer
loans and, to a lesser extent, construction loans and other loans, and
multi-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, the Bank holds investments
permitted by federal laws and regulations including securities issued by the
U.S. Government and agencies thereof. The Bank's revenues are derived
principally from interest on its loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios
and interest and dividends on its investment securities.

The Bank is a community-oriented savings institution offering a variety of
financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves. The Bank's
deposit gathering and lending markets are primarily concentrated in the
communities surrounding its full service offices located in Lake, Sumter and
Citrus counties in central Florida. Management believes that its offices are
located in communities that generally can be characterized as rural service and
retirement communities with residential neighborhoods comprised predominately of
one-to-four-family residences. The Bank is the largest (by asset size)
locally-based financial institution in Lake County, and serves its market area
with a wide selection of residential mortgage loans and other retail financial
services. Management considers the Bank's reputation for financial strength and
customer service as a major advantage in attracting and retaining customers in
its market area and believes it benefits from its community orientation as well
as its established deposit base and level of core deposits.

The Company's net income from operations increased 18.5% to $6.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 from $5.3 million for the year 2000. The Bank's
total assets increased 15.7% to $823.2 million at December 31, 2001 from $711.5
million at December 31, 2000. That increase resulted primarily from a 11.4%
increase in net loans to $685.9 million at December 31, 2001 from $615.5 million
at December 31, 2000, reflecting increased local loan demand. Securities
increased 39.3% or $16.8 million during 2001. Deposits increased 12.8% to $585.1
million at December 31, 2001 from $518.9 million at December 31, 2000. Advances
from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $31.0 million, to $154.0 million at
December 31, 2001 from $123.0 million at December 31, 2000.

REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

General

The operating results of the Bank are affected by Federal laws and regulations
and the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by
the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"), as its chartering agency, and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), as the deposit insurer. The Bank
is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") System and its deposit
accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the SAIF
("Savings Association Insurance Fund"). The Bank must file reports with the OTS
and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to
obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such
as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. The OTS and
the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to test the Bank's compliance with
various regulatory requirements. The activities of the Company and the Bank are
governed by the Home Owner's Loan Act, as amended (the "HOLA"), and, in certain
respects, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDIA"). A more complete
description of the HOLA and FDIA is included in the Form 10-K.

Capital Requirements

The OTS capital regulations require savings institutions to meet three capital
standards: a 1.5% tangible capital standard; a 3% leverage (core capital) ratio;
and an 8% risk-based capital standard. Under the OTS final rule implementing
FDICIA, generally, a well-capitalized institution is defined as one that meets
the following capital standards: a 5% tangible capital standard; a 6% leverage
(core capital) ratio; and a 10% risk-based capital standard, and has not been
notified by its Federal banking agency that it is in a "troubled condition." At
December 31, 2001, the Bank met each of its capital requirements and met the
criteria of a "well-capitalized" institution as defined above.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit
insurance premiums according to the level of risk involved in an institution's
activities. An institution's risk category is based upon whether the institution
is classified as "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized" or "less than
adequately capitalized" and one of three supervisory subcategories within each
capital group. The supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is
based on a supervisory evaluation and information which the FDIC determines to
be relevant to the institution's financial condition and the risk posed to the
deposit insurance fund. Effective January 1, 1997, the FDIC lowered the annual
assessment rates for SAIF members to 0 to 27 basis points. The FDIC has
authority to raise premiums if deemed necessary. If such action is taken, it
could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the institution.


Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a
finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in
an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any
applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the
OTS. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or
violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

CREDIT RISK

The Bank's primary business is lending on residential real estate, commercial
real estate and consumer financing, activities with the inherent risk of
generating potential loan losses the magnitude of which depend on a variety of
factors affecting borrowers which are beyond the control of the Bank. The Bank
has underwriting guidelines and credit review procedures designed to minimize
such credit losses.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company's results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest
income, which is the difference between the income earned on its
interest-earning assets, primarily its loans, mortgage-backed securities and
investment securities, and its interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of
deposits and borrowings. The operating expenses of the Company principally
consist of employee compensation, occupancy expenses and other general and
administrative expenses. The Company's results of operations are also
significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions,
particularly changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions
of regulatory authorities.

Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning
assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends
upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and
the interest rates earned or paid on them.


                                       12
<PAGE>


The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding
(i) the total dollar amount of interest and dividend income of the Company from
interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar
amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant
average costs; (iii) net interest/dividend income; (iv) interest-rate spread;
(v) net interest margin; and (vi) weighted average yields and rates at December
31, 2001. Yields and costs were derived by dividing income or expense by the
average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown.
The average balance of loans includes loans on which the Company has
discontinued accruing interest. The yields and costs include fees which are
considered to constitute adjustments to yields.

CAPITAL  RESOURCES

The Bank's sources of funds include proceeds from payments and prepayments on
mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, proceeds from the maturities of
investment securities and deposits. While maturities and scheduled amortization
of loans and investment securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit
inflows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by local conditions,
general interest rates, and regulatory changes.

At December 31, 2001, the Bank had outstanding commitments to originate $21.1
million of loans, to fund unused lines of credit of $45.8 million, to fund the
undisbursed portion of loans in process of $14.3 million and $1.7 million in
outstanding standby letters of credit. The Bank believes that it will have
sufficient funds available to meet its commitments. At December 31, 2001,
certificates of deposit which were scheduled to mature in one year or less
totaled $314.7 million. Management believes, based on past experience, that a
significant portion of these funds will remain with the Bank.

REGULATORY  CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS

As a federally-chartered financial institution, the Bank is required to maintain
certain minimum amounts of regulatory capital. Regulatory capital is not a
valuation allowance and has not been created by charges against earnings. The
following table provides a summary of the capital requirements, the Bank's
regulatory capital and the amounts in excess at December 31, 2001:

MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of loss from changes in market prices and rates. The
Company's market risk arises primarily from interest-rate risk inherent in its
lending and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors
and manages its interest-rate risk exposure. The measurement of market risk
associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and
offsetting on- and off-balance-sheet transactions are aggregated, and the
resulting net positions are identified. Disclosures about the fair value of
financial instruments, which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's primary objective in managing interest-rate risk is to minimize
the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the Bank's net interest
income and capital, while adjusting the Company's asset-liability structure to
obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. The Company relies
primarily on its asset-liability management to control interest-rate risk.
However, a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely
impact the Company's earnings, to the extent that the interest rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

ASSET /LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

The Bank's primary mission is to provide financing by offering permanent and
construction residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans and
consumer and commercial loans and by providing conveniently located depository
facilities with transaction, savings and certificate accounts. The Bank's goal
is to continue to be a well-capitalized and profitable operation that provides
service that is professional, efficient and courteous. The Bank seeks to fulfill
its mission and accomplish its goals by pursuing the following strategies: (i)
emphasizing lending in the one-to-four-family residential mortgage, commercial
real estate and consumer lending markets; (ii) controlling interest-rate risk;
(iii) managing deposit pricing and asset growth; (iv) emphasizing cost control;
and (v) maintaining asset quality by investing in U.S. government and agency
securities which, in management's judgment, provide a balance between yield and
safety in a home mortgage related investment. It is management's intention to
continue to employ these strategies over the foreseeable future.

The Bank's profitability, like that of most financial institutions, is dependent
to a large extent upon its net interest income, which is the difference between
its interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans, mortgage-backed
securities and investment securities, and its interest expense on
interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings. Financial
institutions continue to be affected by general changes in levels of interest
rates and other economic factors beyond their control. At December 31, 2001, the
Bank's one-year interest sensitivity gap (the difference between the amount of
interest-earning assets anticipated by the Bank to mature or reprice within one
year and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities anticipated by the Bank to
mature or reprice within one year) as a percentage of total assets was a
positive 13.86%. Generally, an institution with a positive gap would experience
an increase in net interest income in a period of rising interest rates or a
decrease in net interest income in a period of declining interest rates.
However, certain shortcomings are inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented
above. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar
maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different manners to
changes in market interest rates. Therefore, no assurance can be given that the
Bank will be able to maintain its net interest-rate spread as market interest
rates fluctuate.

The Bank monitors its interest-rate risk through the Asset/Liability Committee
which meets monthly and reports the results of such monitoring quarterly to the
Board of Directors. The Bank's policy is to seek to maintain a balance between
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities so that the Bank's
cumulative one-year gap ratio is within a range which management believes is
conducive to maintaining profitability without incurring undue risk. The Bank
has increased its investment in adjustable-rate and shorter average life,
fixed-rate mortgage-related securities in order to position itself against the
consequences of rising interest rates. The Bank also maintains liquid assets in
an amount which allows for the possibility of disintermediation when interest
rates fluctuate. The Bank's liquidity ratio was 14.2% at December 31, 2001. In
addition, the Bank's large stable core deposit base resulting from its
continuing commitment to quality customer service has historically provided it
with a steady source of funds.

                 COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001
                      TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000


     General Operating Results. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001
          was $6.3 million, or $1.77 and $1.73 per basic and diluted share,
          respectively, compared to $5.3 million, or $1.50 and $1.46 per basic
          and diluted share, respectively, for the year 2000. The increase was
          primarily due to an increase in interest income of $7.7 million,
          partially offset by increases in interest expense of $5.3 million and
          noninterest expense of $1.4 million.

     Interest Income. Interest income increased $7.7 million or 15.6%, from
          $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $57.0 million
          for 2001. The increase was due to a $114.1 million or 18.4% increase
          in average interest-earning assets outstanding for the year ended
          December 31, 2001 compared to the 2000 period, partially offset by a
          decrease in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets from
          7.98% for the year ended December 31, 2000 to 7.78% for the year ended
          December 31, 2001.

     Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $5.3 million or 17.5%, from
          $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $35.3 million
          for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was due to an
          increase of $116.0 million in average interest-bearing liabilities.
          Average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $569.5 million
          outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2000 to $685.5 million
          outstanding during the comparable period for 2001. The average rate
          paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 5.28% for the year
          ended December 31, 2000 to 5.15% for the comparable 2001 period.

     Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $535,000, or 31.8% for the
          year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the year ended December 31,
          2000 primarily due to an increase of $387,000 in other service charges
          and fees during the 2001 period.

     Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased by $1.4 million or
          12.5%, from $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to
          $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was
          primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of
          $873,000, occupancy expense of $127,000 and data processing expense of
          $90,000, all of which related to the overall growth of the Company.

     Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for federal and state income
          taxes increased from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000
          (an effective tax rate of 38.8%) to $3.7 million (an effective tax
          rate of 37.0%) for the corresponding period for 2001.

                 COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000
                       TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999


     General Operating Results. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2000
          was $5.3 million, or $1.50 and $1.46 per basic and diluted share,
          respectively, compared to $5.4 million, or $1.52 and $1.47 per basic
          and diluted share, respectively, for the comparable period in 1999.
          Net income for the 1999 period included a gain on sale of real estate
          held for development of $886,000 ($552,000, net of tax). Without the
          1999 gain on sale, net income for 2000 exceeded net income for the
          1999 period by $459,000 or 9.5%. An increase in interest income of
          $10.7 million, partially offset by increases in interest expense of
          $8.9 million and noninterest expense of $1.1 million contributed to
          the increase in net income during the current year.

     Interest Income. Interest income increased $10.7 million or 27.8%, from
          $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 to $49.4 million
          for the comparable period in 2000. The increase was due to a $119.2
          million or 23.9% increase in average interest-earning assets
          outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to the 1999
          period and an increase in the average yield earned on interest-earning
          assets from 7.73% for the year ended December 31, 1999 to 7.98% for
          the year ended December 31, 2000.

     Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $8.9 million or 41.7%, from
          $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 to $30.1 million
          for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was due to an
          increase of $118.1 million in average interest-bearing liabilities.
          Average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $451.4 million
          outstanding during the year ended December 31, 1999 to $569.5 million
          outstanding during the comparable period for 2000. The average yield
          paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased from 4.70% for the year
          ended December 31, 1999 to 5.28% for the comparable 2000 period.

     Noninterest Income. Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 1999
          exceeded noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2000
          primarily as a result of the previously discussed pretax gain on sale
          of real estate held for development recognized during 1999, partially
          offset by an increase of $201,000 in deposit account fees during the
          2000 period.

     Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased by $1.1 million or
          10.7%, from $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 to
          $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was
          primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of
          $500,000, occupancy expense of $370,000 and data processing expense of
          $288,000, all of which related to the overall growth of the Company.

     Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for federal and state income
          taxes increased from $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999
          (an effective tax rate of 37.9%) to $3.4 million (an effective tax
          rate of 38.8%) for the corresponding period for 2000.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented herein have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the measurement of
financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due
to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the
Bank's operations. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all the assets and
liabilities of the Bank are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have
a greater impact on the Bank's performance than do the effects of general levels
of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to
the same extent as the price of goods and services.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999


(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

FFLC Bancorp,  Inc. (the  "Holding  Company")  was  incorporated  in Delaware on
     September 16, 1993, and acquired First Federal  Savings Bank of Lake County
     (the  "Bank") in  connection  with the Bank's  conversion  to stock form on
     January 4, 1994. The Holding  Company is a savings and loan holding company
     subject to  regulation  by the Office of Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS") which
     mainly transacts its business through its subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank is
     a  community-oriented   savings  institution  which  offers  a  variety  of
     financial services to individuals and businesses  primarily located in Lake
     County, Sumter County and Citrus County,  Florida. The deposits of the Bank
     are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC") through
     the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF").

     During 2001,  First  Alliance  Title,  LLC, a 90% owned  subsidiary  of the
     Holding  Company was formed to operate as a title agency.  This  subsidiary
     had minimal activity through December 31, 2001.

Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated  financial statements include the
     accounts of the  Holding  Company  and its two  subsidiaries,  the Bank and
     First Alliance  Title,  LLC and the Bank's  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Lake
     County Service  Corporation  (the "Service  Corporation").  All significant
     intercompany   transactions   and   balances   have  been   eliminated   in
     consolidation.

General. The  accounting  and reporting  policies of FFLC Bancorp,  Inc. and its
     subsidiaries  (together,  the "Company")  conform to accounting  principles
     generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices
     within the banking  industry.  The  following  summarizes  the  significant
     accounting policies of the Company:

Use  of Estimates.  In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity
     with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the United  States of
     America,  management  is required to make  estimates and  assumptions  that
     affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
     balance  sheet and reported  amounts of revenues  and  expenses  during the
     reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.
     Material estimates that are particularly  susceptible to significant change
     in the near term  relate to the  determination  of the  allowance  for loan
     losses and foreclosed assets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.  For purposes of the consolidated  statements of cash
     flows, cash and cash equivalents  include cash and balances due from banks,
     interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold.

The  Bank is required to maintain certain average reserve  balances  pursuant to
     regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. These balances must be maintained
     in the form of vault  cash or  noninterest  bearing  deposits  at a Federal
     Reserve Bank. The Bank met this requirement at December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Securities.  The Company may classify its securities as either trading,  held to
     maturity or available for sale. Trading securities are held principally for
     resale and  recorded at their fair values.  Unrealized  gains and losses on
     trading securities are included  immediately in earnings.  Held-to-maturity
     securities are those which the Company has the positive  intent and ability
     to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost.  Available-for-sale
     securities  consist of securities not classified as trading  securities nor
     as held-to-maturity securities. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of
     tax, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from income and reported
     in  other   comprehensive   income.   Gains  and  losses  on  the  sale  of
     available-for-sale securities are recorded on the trade date and determined
     using  the  specific-identification   method.  Premiums  and  discounts  on
     securities  available for sale are recognized in interest  income using the
     interest method over the period to maturity.


                                       28

Loans.  Loans  that  management  has the  intent  and  ability  to hold  for the
     foreseeable  future or until  maturity  or pay-off  are  reported  at their
     outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs,  the allowance for loan
     losses, and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans.

Loan origination fees and certain direct  origination  costs are capitalized and
     recognized as an adjustment of the yield of the related loan.

The  accrual of  interest  on loans is  discontinued  at the time the loan is 90
     days delinquent  unless the loan is well  collateralized  and in process of
     collection.  In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at
     an earlier  date if  collection  of  principal  or interest  is  considered
     doubtful.

All  interest  accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual
     or charged-off is reversed against  interest income.  The interest on these
     loans is accounted for on the  cash-basis or  cost-recovery  method,  until
     qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when
     all the  principal  and  interest  amounts  contractually  due are  brought
     current and future payments are reasonably assured.

Allowance for Loan  Losses.  The  allowance  for loan losses is  established  as
     losses are estimated to have  occurred  through a provision for loan losses
     charged to earnings.  Loan losses are charged  against the  allowance  when
     management  believes the  uncollectibility  of a loan balance is confirmed.
     Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.

     The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management
     and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectibility of the
     loans in light of historical experience,  the nature and volume of the loan
     portfolio,  adverse  situations  that may affect the borrower's  ability to
     repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic
     conditions.  This  evaluation  is  inherently  subjective  as  it  requires
     estimates that are susceptible to significant  revision as more information
     becomes available.

     A loan is  considered  impaired  when,  based on  current  information  and
     events,  it is  probable  that the  Company  will be unable to collect  the
     scheduled  payments of  principal  or interest  when due  according  to the
     contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Factors  considered by management
     in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the
     probability of collecting  scheduled  principal and interest  payments when
     due.  Loans  that  experience  insignificant  payment  delays  and  payment
     shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.  Management determines
     the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case
     basis,  taking into consideration all of the circumstances  surrounding the
     loan and the borrower,  including the length of the delay,  the reasons for
     the delay,  the  borrower's  prior  payment  record,  and the amount of the
     shortfall in relation to the  principal  and interest  owed.  Impairment is
     measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial loans by either the present
     value of expected  future  cash flows  discounted  at the loan's  effective
     interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the
     collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

     Large  groups  of  smaller  balance   homogeneous  loans  are  collectively
     evaluated  for  impairment.  Accordingly,  the Company does not  separately
     identify   individual   consumer  and  residential   loans  for  impairment
     disclosures.

Foreclosed Assets.  Assets acquired  through,  or in lieu of,  foreclosure,  are
     initially  recorded  at  fair  value  at the  date  of  foreclosure.  After
     foreclosure,  valuations are  periodically  performed by management and the
     assets are carried at the lower of carrying  amount or fair value less cost
     to sell.  Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation
     allowance are included in income.

Premises and  Equipment.  Land is  carried  at  cost.  The  Company's  premises,
     furniture and equipment  and  leasehold  improvements  are carried at cost,
     less accumulated  depreciation and amortization  computed principally using
     the straight-line method.

Transfer of Financial Assets. Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as
     sales,  when  control  over the assets has been  surrendered.  Control over
     transferred  assets is deemed to be  surrendered  when (1) the assets  have
     been isolated from the Company,  (2) the transferee obtains the right (free
     of  conditions  that  constrain it from taking  advantage of that right) to
     pledge or exchange  the  transferred  assets,  and (3) the Company does not
     maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement
     to repurchase them before their maturity.

Income Taxes.  Deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  are  determined  using the
     liability (or balance  sheet) method.  Under this method,  the net deferred
     tax  asset or  liability  is  determined  based on the tax  effects  of the
     temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various balance
     sheet assets and  liabilities  and gives current  recognition to changes in
     tax rates and laws.

StockCompensation Plans.  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
     123,  Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,  encourages all entities to
     adopt  a  fair  value  based  method  of  accounting   for  employee  stock
     compensation plans, whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date
     based on the value of the award and is recognized  over the service period,
     which is usually the vesting period.  However,  it also allows an entity to
     continue to measure  compensation  cost for those plans using the intrinsic
     value based method of accounting  prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
     Opinion  No.  25,  Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to  Employees,   whereby
     compensation  cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the
     stock at the grant  date (or other  measurement  date)  over the  amount an
     employee  must pay to acquire the stock.  Stock  options  issued  under the
     Company's  stock option plan have no intrinsic value at the grant date, and
     under  Opinion No. 25 no  compensation  cost is  recognized  for them.  The
     Company has elected to continue with the accounting  methodology in Opinion
     No. 25 and, as a result,  has provided  proforma  disclosures of net income
     and income  per share and other  disclosures,  as if the fair  value  based
     method of accounting had been applied. (See Note 16).

Off-Balance Sheet Instruments.  In the ordinary course of business,  the Company
     has entered into off-balance-sheet instruments consisting of commitments to
     extend  credit,  unused lines of credit,  undisbursed  loans in process and
     standby letters of credit.  Such financial  instruments are recorded in the
     financial statements when they are funded.

Fair Values of Financial  Instruments.  The fair value of a financial instrument
     is the current  amount that would be  exchanged  between  willing  parties,
     other than in a forced  liquidation.  Fair value is best  determined  based
     upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances,  there are no quoted
     market prices for the Company's  various  financial  instruments.  In cases
     where  quoted  market  prices are not  available,  fair values are based on
     estimates  using  present  value  or  other  valuation  techniques.   Those
     techniques are significantly  affected by the assumptions  used,  including
     the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair
     value  estimates  may not be realized  in an  immediate  settlement  of the
     instrument.  SFAS  107  excludes  certain  financial  instruments  and  all
     nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the
     aggregate fair value amounts  presented may not  necessarily  represent the
     underlying fair value of the Company. The following methods and assumptions
     were  used  by  the  Company  in   estimating   fair  values  of  financial
     instruments:

          Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and short-term
          instruments approximate their fair value.

          Securities. Fair values for securities available for sale are based on
          quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
          available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable
          instruments.  The  carrying  value of  Federal  Home Loan  Bank  stock
          approximates fair value.


                                       30
<PAGE>


          Loans.  For  variable-rate  loans that reprice  frequently and have no
          significant  change in credit risk,  fair values are based on carrying
          values.   Fair  values  for  fixed-rate   loans  are  estimated  using
          discounted  cash flow analyses,  using interest rates  currently being
          offered for loans with similar  terms to  borrowers of similar  credit
          quality.

          Deposit Liabilities.  The fair values disclosed for demand, NOW, money
          market and savings  deposits are, by  definition,  equal to the amount
          payable  on demand at the  reporting  date  (that is,  their  carrying
          amounts).  Fair  values for  fixed-rate  certificates  of deposit  are
          estimated  using a  discounted  cash  flow  calculation  that  applies
          interest rates  currently  being offered on certificates to a schedule
          of aggregated expected monthly maturities of certificates of deposit.

          Borrowed Funds.  The carrying  amounts of borrowings  under repurchase
          agreements  approximate their fair values. Fair values of Federal Home
          Loan Bank advances are estimated  using  discounted cash flow analysis
          based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for similar
          types of borrowing arrangements.

          Accrued Interest. The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate
          their fair values.

          Off-Balance-Sheet   Instruments.  Fair  values  for  off-balance-sheet
          lending  commitments are based on fees currently charged to enter into
          similar  agreements,  taking into account the  remaining  terms of the
          agreements and the counterparties' credit standing.

Income Per  Share of  Common  Stock.  The  Company  follows  the  provisions  of
     Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 128,  "Earnings  Per Share" (SFAS No.
     128).  SFAS  No.  128  provides  accounting  and  reporting  standards  for
     calculating  income per share.  Basic  income per share of common stock has
     been   computed   by   dividing   the  net  income  for  the  year  by  the
     weighted-average  number of  shares  outstanding.  Shares  of common  stock
     purchased by the Employee  Stock Option Plan ("ESOP") and the Retention and
     Recognition Plan ("RRP")  incentive plans (see Note 16) are only considered
     outstanding  when the shares are  released or  committed to be released for
     allocation to participants. The ESOP initially purchased 368,242 shares, of
     which 4,383 shares were released for allocation to participants  each month
     beginning in January,  1994.  As of December 31, 2000,  all ESOP shares had
     been  allocated.  The RRP  initially  purchased  184,122  shares,  of which
     179,373,  181,387  and  181,387  were  allocated  to  participants  and are
     considered  outstanding  for the years ended  December 31,  1999,  2000 and
     2001,  respectively.  At December 31, 2001, 2,735 shares remain uncommitted
     under the RRP plan and are not considered  outstanding  for purposes of the
     computation  of net income per share of common  stock.  Diluted  income per
     share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average  number of
     shares outstanding including the dilutive effect of stock options (see Note
     16) computed using the treasury stock method.  The following table presents
     the calculation of net income per share of common stock:

Comprehensive Income.  Accounting  principles  generally require that recognized
     revenue,  expenses, gains and losses be included in net earnings.  Although
     certain  changes in assets and  liabilities,  such as unrealized  gains and
     losses  on  available-for-sale  securities,  are  reported  as  a  separate
     component of the equity  section of the balance  sheet,  such items,  along
     with net earnings,  are components of comprehensive  income. The components
     of other  comprehensive  income were unrealized holding gains and losses on
     securities available for sale.

Reclassifications.  Certain amounts in the 1999 and 2000 consolidated  financial
     statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for 2001.

     During the second  quarter of 2001,  an impaired loan in the amount of $1.3
     million was repaid.

     The  Company  originates or purchases  nonresidential  real property loans.
          These loans are  considered by  management  to be of somewhat  greater
          risk of uncollectibility due to the dependency on income production or
          future  development  of the real estate.  Nearly all of the  Company's
          real  property  loans were  collateralized  by real  property in Lake,
          Sumter and Citrus Counties, Florida.

     Nonaccrual loans at December  31, 2001 and 2000  totaled  $1.9  million and
          $2.5  million,  respectively.  For the years ended  December 31, 2001,
          2000 and 1999,  interest  income on loans  would  have been  increased
          approximately  $116,000,  $230,000 and $99,000,  respectively,  if the
          interest on  nonaccrual  loans had been  recorded  under the  original
          terms of such loans.

    Loans serviced for others, consisting solely of participations sold, are not
          included in the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets. The unpaid
          principal  balances of these loans were approximately $1.5 million and
          $.9 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     (A)  Adjustable Rate

     (B) The FHLB has the  option to  convert  to an  adjustable  rate in future
     years.

     The  security   agreement  with  FHLB  includes  a  blanket  floating  lien
          requiring  the  Bank to  maintain  first  mortgage  loans  as  pledged
          collateral in an amount equal to at least,  when  discounted at 75% of
          the unpaid principal balances,  100% of these advances. The FHLB stock
          is also  pledged as  collateral  for these  advances.  At December 31,
          2001,  the Bank  could  borrow  up to  $216.4  million  under the FHLB
          security agreement.

     The  Bank  has an $8  million  line  of  credit  facility  with  one of its
          correspondent  banks,  under  which the Bank may draw  funds for daily
          liquidity.  Borrowings under this line of credit must be repaid within
          seven days. The line of credit bears a floating interest rate equal to
          the average  federal  funds rate and expires on June 30,  2002.  As of
          December 31, 2001, the Bank has not used this line of credit.

     Other borrowed funds were  composed of retail  repurchase  agreements  with
          customers.  The Company enters into retail repurchase  agreements with
          customers in which the funds  received are accounted for as borrowings
          to the Company. The total amount outstanding under these agreements at
          December  31,  2001 and 2000  were  $13.3  million  and $6.4  million,
          respectively.  The Company pledged securities with a carrying value of
          $18.7 million and $9.9 million as collateral  for these  agreements at
          December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

(7)  Income Taxes

     The  Holding Company and its  subsidiaries  file  consolidated  federal and
          state income tax returns. Income taxes are allocated proportionally to
          the Holding  Company and each of the  subsidiaries  as though separate
          income tax returns were filed.

     Retained earnings at December 31, 2001 and 2000 includes approximately $5.8
          million for which no deferred  federal  income tax  liability has been
          recognized. This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt
          deductions  for tax purposes  only.  Reduction of amounts so allocated
          for  purposes  other than tax bad debt losses or  adjustments  arising
          from  carryback of net  operating  losses would create  income for tax
          purposes  only,  which would be subject to the then current  corporate
          income tax rate. The unrecorded  deferred  income tax liability on the
          above amount was  approximately  $2.2 million at December 31, 2001 and
          2000.

     The  Small  Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act") enacted on
          August 2, 1996  requires  savings  institutions,  such as the Bank, to
          recapture certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves, and
          eliminated  the  Percentage of Taxable Income Method of accounting for
          bad debts for tax purposes. The Bank was required to change its method
          of  accounting  for bad debts for tax  purposes  effective  January 1,
          1996.  In addition,  the Bank was required to recapture  the excess of
          its bad debt reserves at December 31, 1995 over its base year reserves
          at December 31,  1987,  ratably  over a six-year  period  beginning in
          1998.  At December 31, 2001,  the Bank had  approximately  $262,000 of
          deferred tax liabilities  recorded for the recapture of its excess bad
          debt reserves.

     (8)  Financial  Instruments

          The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet
          risk in the normal course of business to meet the  financing  needs of
          its  customers  and to reduce  its own  exposure  to  fluctuations  in
          interest rates. These financial  instruments are commitments to extend
          credit,  unused  lines of credit,  undisbursed  loans in  process  and
          standby  letters  of  credit  and may  involve,  to  varying  degrees,
          elements  of credit  and  interest-rate  risk in excess of the  amount
          recognized in the consolidated  balance sheet. The contract amounts of
          these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in
          these financial instruments.

     The  Company's  exposure to credit loss in the event of  nonperformance  by
          the other party to the financial  instrument for commitments to extend
          credit is represented by the contractual  amount of those instruments.
          The Company uses the same credit policies in making  commitments as it
          does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

     Commitments to extend  credit are  agreements to lend to a customer as long
          as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
          Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
          clauses  and  may  require  payment  of  a  fee.  Since  some  of  the
          commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total
          commitment   amounts  do  not   necessarily   represent   future  cash
          requirements.  The Company evaluates each customer's credit worthiness
          on a case-by-case  basis. The amount of collateral  obtained if deemed
          necessary  by the  Company  upon  extension  of  credit  is  based  on
          management's credit evaluation of the counterparty.

     Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company
          to  guarantee  the  performance  of a customer to a third  party.  The
          credit risk involved in issuing  letters of credit is essentially  the
          same as that involved in extending loans to customers.

(9) Significant Group Concentration of Credit Risk

The  Company  grants real estate,  commercial  and  consumer  loans to customers
     primarily  in the State of Florida  with the  majority of such loans in the
     Lake, Sumter and Citrus County area.  Therefore,  the Company's exposure to
     credit  risk is  significantly  affected  by changes in the  economy of the
     Lake,  Sumter and Citrus  County  areas.  In  addition,  the  Company has a
     concentration  of  single-family  residential  mortgage loans in a specific
     residential   retirement  community  of  approximately  $110.0  million  at
     December 31, 2001.

The  contractual  amounts  of  credit  related  financial  instruments  such  as
     commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential  accounting
     loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer  default and the
     value of any existing collateral become worthless.

(11)  Commitments and Contingencies

     In   the ordinary course of business,  the Company has various  outstanding
          commitments and contingent  liabilities  that are not reflected in the
          accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements.  In  addition,  the
          Company is a defendant in certain claims and legal actions  arising in
          the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management,  after
          consultation  with legal  counsel,  the ultimate  disposition of these
          matters  is not  expected  to have a  material  adverse  effect on the
          consolidated financial condition of the Company.

(12)  Restrictions on Retained Earnings

     The  Bank is  subject to certain  restrictions  on the amount of  dividends
          that it may declare without prior regulatory approval. At December 31,
          2001,  approximately $20.7 million of retained earnings were available
          for dividend declaration without prior regulatory approval.

(13)  Regulatory Matters

     The  Bank  is   subject   to  various   regulatory   capital   requirements
          administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum
          capital  requirements  can  initiate  certain  mandatory  and possibly
          additional  discretionary  actions by regulators  that, if undertaken,
          could  have  a  direct  material  effect  on the  Company's  financial
          statements.  Under  capital  adequacy  guidelines  and the  regulatory
          framework for prompt  corrective  action,  the Bank must meet specific
          capital  guidelines that involve  quantitative  measures of the Bank's
          assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated
          under regulatory accounting practices.  The Bank's capital amounts and
          classification  are also  subject  to  qualitative  judgements  by the
          regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

     Quantitative measures  established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
          require the Bank to maintain  minimum  amounts (set forth in the table
          below) of total and Tier I capital (as defined in the  regulations) to
          risk-weighted assets (as defined). Management believes, as of December
          31, 2001,  that the Bank meets all capital  adequacy  requirements  to
          which it is subject.

     As   of  December  31,  2001,  the most  recent  notification  from the OTS
          categorized  the  Bank  as  well  capitalized   under  the  regulatory
          framework for prompt  corrective  action.  To be  categorized  as well
          capitalized,  the Bank must maintain minimum tangible,  tier I (core),
          tier I (risk-based) and total  risk-based  capital ratios as set forth
          in  the  table.   There  are  no   conditions  or  events  since  that
          notification  that management  believes have changed the institution's
          category.

(14)  Conversion to Stock Savings Bank

     The  Bank  successfully  completed a conversion from a federally  chartered
          mutual savings association to a federally chartered stock savings bank
          on January 4, 1994  pursuant  to the Plan of  Conversion.  The Plan of
          Conversion  provided for the  establishment  of a Liquidation  Account
          equal to the retained income of the Bank as of September 30, 1993 (the
          date of the most recent  financial  statement  presented  in the final
          conversion  prospectus).  The  Liquidation  Account is  established to
          provide  a  limited  priority  claim  to the  assets  of the  Bank  to
          qualifying  depositors  as of  September  30, 1992  (Eligible  Account
          Holders)  who  continue  to  maintain   deposits  in  the  Bank  after
          conversion.  In the unlikely  event of a complete  liquidation  of the
          Bank,  and only in such event,  each  Eligible  Account  Holder  would
          receive from the Liquidation Account a liquidation  distribution based
          on their  proportionate  share of the then total remaining  qualifying
          deposits.

     Current regulations  allow the Bank to pay dividends on its stock after the
          conversion  if its  regulatory  capital  would not  thereby be reduced
          below the amount  then  required  for the  aforementioned  Liquidation
          Account.  Also,  capital  distribution  regulations  limit the  Bank's
          ability to make capital  distributions which include dividends,  stock
          redemptions and repurchases,  cash-out  mergers,  interest payments on
          certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital
          account based on their capital level and supervisory condition.

(15)  401(k) Plan

     Effective  January 1, 2001,  the Board of  Directors  approved the transfer
          from the  multi-employer  401(k) plan the Company had participated in,
          to a  single  employer  401(k)  plan  ("KSOP"),  and the  simultaneous
          combination  of that  plan  with the  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan
          discussed in Note 16. Under the new KSOP, participation is open to all
          employees  the  month  after  hire  date  (for  purposes  of  employer
          contributions, one year of service is required), and participants have
          the twelve  investment  options  offered by the previous plan,  plus a
          Company stock fund. The Company makes a contribution of at least 3% of
          compensation  (for  all  participants  who have  met the  one-year  of
          service  requirement),  which  vests  immediately.  In  addition,  the
          Company  will  make a  discretionary  matching  contribution  (for all
          participants who have met the one-year of service requirement),  which
          will vest after five years of service.  For 2001, the Board approved a
          matching  contribution equal to 100% of employees'  deferrals up to 3%
          of compensation,  which totaled $282,000.  The amounts of employee and
          employer contributions under the KSOP, 401(k) and the ESOP are subject
          to IRS limitations.

     Prior to January 1, 2001, the  Company  had a defined  contribution  profit
          sharing  401(k) plan (the  "401(k)  Plan").  All  employees  who met a
          minimum service  requirement (1,000 hours of service in a twelve-month
          period) participated in the Plan. Under the 401(k) Plan, a participant
          could  elect to  contribute  up to 15% of their  annual  compensation,
          subject to IRS limitations on total annual contributions.  The Company
          made  contributions  to the  401(k)  Plan on a  monthly  basis  at two
          percent of  participants'  compensation.  Contributions  to the 401(k)
          Plan for the years ended  December  31, 2000 and 1999 were $65,700 and
          $54,000, respectively.

(16)  Stock Benefit Plans

     The  Company  follows the  provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting
          Standards No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation"  ("SFAS
          No. 123"). SFAS No. 123 applies to stock-based  compensation under the
          Company's  incentive  stock option plan (the "Option  Plan") and under
          the Company's  Recognition  and Retention  Plan  discussed  below.  As
          allowed by SFAS No. 123,  the  Company  elected to continue to measure
          compensation  cost for the options or shares granted under either plan
          using the  intrinsic  value  method of  accounting  prescribed  by APB
          Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."  SFAS No.
          123 does not apply to the  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan  discussed
          below.

     StockOption Plan.  The Company has a Stock Option Plan under which  460,303
          common shares are authorized to be granted to directors,  officers and
          employees  of the  Bank.  Shares  granted  under the  Option  Plan are
          exercisable  at the market price at the date of grant.  Such incentive
          stock options  granted to officers and employees  are  exercisable  in
          three equal annual  installments,  with the first installment becoming
          exercisable  one year  from  the date of  grant.  Options  granted  to
          outside directors are exercisable  immediately,  but any common shares
          obtained  from  exercise  of the  options may not be sold prior to one
          year from the date of grant.  All options expire at the earlier of ten
          years for officers and  employees or twenty years for  directors  from
          the date of grant or one year  following  the date  which the  outside
          director,  officer or employee  ceases to serve in such  capacity.  At
          December 31, 2001,  33,714 shares remain available for grant to future
          directors, officers and employees.

     The following is a summary of option transactions:
                                                                  Weighted-

     During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, 5,035 and 16,250 options
          were  granted  under the Option Plan.  No options  were granted  under
          either plan during  2001.  SFAS No. 123  requires pro forma fair value
          disclosures if the intrinsic value method is being utilized.  In order
          to  calculate  the fair value of the options  granted,  it was assumed
          that  the  risk-free  interest  rate was  7.0%  for  each  period,  an
          annualized  dividend yield of approximately  2.0% would apply over the
          exercise period,  the expected life of the options would be the entire
          exercise  period and the expected  stock  volatility  was 37% and 36%,
          respectively,   for  2000  and  1999.   For   purposes  of  pro  forma
          disclosures,  the estimated  fair value was included in expense in the
          period vesting occurs. The proforma information has been determined as
          if the Company had  accounted  for its stock  options and share awards
          under the fair  value  method of SFAS No.  123 and is as  follows  (in

     Employee Stock  Ownership  Plan.  Through  December 31,  2000,  the Company
          sponsored  a  leveraged  ESOP  that  covered  eligible  employees  who
          completed a year of service. The Bank made quarterly  contributions to
          the ESOP equal to the ESOP's debt  service.  The ESOP Trust  purchased
          368,242  shares  of  common  stock  in the  Company's  initial  public
          offering  with the proceeds  from a loan from the  Company.  That loan
          bore  interest at a  fixed-rate  of six  percent  with  principal  and
          interest payable in equal quarterly  installments over seven years and
          the loan was paid-off in December 2000. The ESOP shares initially were
          pledged as  collateral  for its debt.  As the debt was repaid,  shares
          were released from collateral and allocated to active  employees based
          on the  proportion  of debt service paid during the year.  The Company
          accounted for its ESOP in accordance  with Statement of Position 93-6.
          Accordingly, the debt of the ESOP was recorded as debt and the cost of
          the shares  pledged as  collateral  were  reported as a contra  equity
          account. As shares were released from collateral, the Company recorded
          compensation  expense,  and an offsetting credit to capital,  equal to
          the  current  market  price  of the  shares,  and  the  shares  became
          outstanding for income per share  computations.  Dividends on all ESOP
          shares were recorded as  compensation  expense as it was  management's
          intention  to  allocate  the  dividends  along  with the  shares  when
          allocated.  Compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2000
          and 1999 included the following ESOP related costs:

     Effective January 1, 2001, the Board of Directors approved the combining of
          the ESOP with the Company's  401(k) Plan to form a new Plan, the KSOP.
          (See Note 15). In connection  therewith,  the Company makes  quarterly
          profit-sharing  contributions  in amounts  approved by the Board,  and
          those  contributions  are  allocated to the accounts of  participating
          employees on a quarterly basis.  Company  contributions under the KSOP
          vest  after  five  years of  service.  For 2001,  the  Board  approved
          profit-sharing  contributions equal to four percent (4%) of the Bank's
          operating net income,  which were made after each quarter based on the
          actual  results  of the  preceding  quarter.  During  the  year  ended
          December  31,  2001,  the Company  made profit  sharing  contributions
          totaling  $231,000  to the KSOP.  The Plan  allows the Company to fund
          such KSOP  contributions  by either issuing shares,  or purchasing the
          required  number of shares on the open  market.  As these  shares  are
          allocated  on a  quarterly  basis,  the Company  records  compensation
          expense, and either an offsetting credit to capital (in the event that
          new  shares  are  issued)  or to cash (in the event  that  shares  are
          purchased on the open  market),  equal to the current  market price of
          the  shares.  The  shares  become  outstanding  for  income  per share
          computations when allocated.

     Recognition and Retention Plan. The Company  adopted,  and the shareholders
          approved,  an RRP for directors,  officers and employees to enable the
          Bank to attract  and retain  experienced  and  capable  personnel.  On
          January 4, 1994, the conversion  date,  184,122 shares of common stock
          were purchased for the RRP which  included  8,067 shares  reserved for
          future directors,  officers and employees.  The shares were granted in
          the form of  restricted  stock to be  earned  in  three  equal  annual
          installments  beginning April 4, 1995. The RRP shares purchased in the
          conversion  initially  were excluded from  stockholders'  equity.  The
          Company  recognized  compensation  expense  in the  amount of the fair
          market  value of the  common  stock at the grant date of $6 per share,
          pro rata over the years (1996,  1995 and 1994) during which the shares
          were earned and payable and recorded a credit to stockholders' equity.
          The shares are  entitled to all voting and other  shareholder  rights,
          except that the shares,  while restricted,  cannot be sold, pledged or
          otherwise disposed of, and are required to be held in escrow.

     If   a holder of restricted  stock under the RRP terminated  employment for
          reasons other than death, disability,  retirement or change of control
          in the Company,  such  employee  forfeited all rights to any allocated
          shares which are still restricted.  If termination is caused by death,
          disability,  retirement  or  change in  control  of the  Company,  all
          allocated shares become  unrestricted.  Forfeitures are reallocated to
          eligible  participants  annually.  At December 31, 2001,  2,735 shares
          remain reserved for future directors, officers and employees.

(17)  Stock Repurchase Program

     In   September  1998, the Company's  Board of Directors  approved a program
          which allowed the Company to acquire 369,285 shares of common stock in
          the open  market.  During  2001,  2000,  1999 and  1998,  the  Company
          repurchased 19,936, 95,562, 147,102 and 32,025 shares, respectively or
          5.4%,  25.9%,  39.8% and 8.7%,  respectively  under this  program.  At
          December  31, 2001,  the Company can still  repurchase  an  additional
          74,660 shares under this program.

(18)  Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     On   January 7, 2000, the Company established a Dividend  Reinvestment Plan
          (the  "DRP").  The DRP was  approved  by the  Board  of  Directors  on
          December 30, 1999 and is intended to provide stockholders of record of
          at  least  50  shares  with  a  convenient   and   economical  way  to
          automatically reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends and to
          invest optional cash payments, subject to minimum and maximum purchase
          limitations, in additional shares of common stock. Stockholders pay no
          service  charges or brokerage  commissions  for common stock purchased
          under the DRP.  During the years  ended  December  31,  2001 and 2000,
          19,341 and 19,969 shares of common stock, respectively, were purchased
          under  the DRP of which 0 and  9,968  were new  shares  issued  by the
          Company  and 19,341  and  10,001  shares  were  purchased  in the open
          market, respectively in these periods.

The Board of Directors
FFLC Bancorp, Inc.
Leesburg, Florida:

     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of FFLC
Bancorp,  Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2001 and 2000
and the related  consolidated  statements  of income,  changes in  stockholders'
equity  and cash  flows for each of the  years in the  three-year  period  ended
December 31, 2001.  These  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of the
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards  require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the results of its  operations and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year  period ended December 31, 2001 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
