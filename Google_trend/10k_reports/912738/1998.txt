ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business

The registrant,  FFLC Bancorp,  Inc.  ("FFLC" or the  "Company"),  completed its
public  offering of 4,603,032  shares  (adjusted  for stock split) of its common
stock and acquired  First  Federal  Savings  Bank of Lake County  ("the  Savings
Bank")  in  connection  with the  Savings  Bank's  conversion  from a  federally
chartered mutual savings association to a federally chartered stock savings bank
on January 4, 1994. The net conversion  proceeds  totaled $26.6 million of which
$13.3 million was invested in the Savings Bank and $13.3 million was retained by
the  registrant.  The  registrant  loaned  $2.2  million to the  Employee  Stock
Ownership  Plan and the remaining  $11.1  million has been invested  through the
Savings Bank. The  registrant,  which was  incorporated in Delaware on September
16, 1993, is a savings and loan holding  company and is subject to regulation by
the Office of Thrift Supervision  ("OTS"). The registrant has not transacted any
material  business  other than  through its  subsidiary,  the Savings  Bank.  At
December  31,  1997,  the  Company  had  total  assets  of  $400.2  million  and
stockholders' equity of $51.4 million.

The Savings Bank was established in 1934 as a federally-chartered mutual savings
and loan association. The Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank
("FHLB")  System and its deposit  accounts are insured to the maximum  allowable
amount by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC").  At December 31,
1997,  the Savings  Bank had total  assets of $400.2  million and  stockholders'
equity of $44.5 million.

The principal  business of the Savings Bank is attracting  retail  deposits from
the general  public and  investing  those  deposits,  together with payments and
repayments  on loans  and  investments  and  funds  generated  from  operations,
primarily in mortgage loans secured by  one-to-four-family  owner-occupied homes
and  mortgage-backed  securities,  and, to a lesser extent,  construction loans,
consumer  and other loans,  and  multi-family  residential  mortgage  loans.  In
addition,  the Savings  Bank holds  investments  permitted  by federal  laws and
regulations  including  securities  issued by the U.S.  Government  and agencies
thereof.  The Savings Bank's revenues are derived  principally  from interest on
its mortgage loan and  mortgage-backed  securities  portfolios  and interest and
dividends on its investment securities.

Market Area and Competition

The Savings Bank is a community-oriented  savings institution offering a variety
of  financial  services  to meet the needs of the  communities  it  serves.  The
Savings Bank's deposit gathering and lending markets are primarily  concentrated
in the  communities  surrounding  its full service  offices  located in Lake and
Sumter  counties in central  Florida.  The Savings Bank's  competition for loans
comes  principally from commercial  banks,  savings  institutions,  and mortgage
banking  companies.  The Savings Bank's most direct  competition for savings has
historically come from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions.
The Savings  Bank faces  additional  competition  for savings  from money market
mutual funds and other corporate and government  securities  funds.  The Savings
Bank  also  faces  increased  competition  for  deposits  from  other  financial
intermediaries such as securities brokerage firms and insurance companies.

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
The Company's market risk arises primarily from  interest-rate  risk inherent in
its lending and deposit  taking  activities.  To that end,  management  actively
monitors and manages its interest-rate risk exposure.  The measurement of market
risk associated  with financial  instruments is meaningful only when all related
and offsetting on- and  off-balance-sheet  transactions are aggregated,  and the
resulting  net  positions are  identified.  Disclosures  about the fair value of
financial instruments,  which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's  primary objective is managing  interest-rate  risk is to minimize
the  adverse  impact of changes  in  interest  rates on the Bank's net  interest
income and capital, while adjusting the Company's  asset-liability  structure to
obtain the maximum  yield-cost  spread on that  structure.  The  Company  relies
primarily  on its  asset-liability  structure  to  control  interest-rate  risk.
However,  a sudden and  substantial  increase  in interest  rates may  adversely
impact the Company's  earnings,  to the extent that the interest  rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed,  to the same extent,  or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

Lending Activities

Loan  Portfolio.  The  Savings  Bank's  loan  portfolio  consists  primarily  of
conventional first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family  residences.  At
December  31,  1997,  the Savings  Bank's  total loans  outstanding  were $329.0
million,  of which  $245.5  million or 74.6% of the  Savings  Bank's  total loan
portfolio  were  one-to-four-family  residential  first mortgage  loans.  Of the
one-to-four-family  residential  mortgage loans  outstanding at that date, 22.6%
were fixed rate loans and 77.4% were adjustable-rate  ("ARM") loans. At the same
date,  commercial  real estate  loans and other  loans on  improved  real estate
totaled  $38.0  million,  or 11.5% of the Savings  Bank's total loan  portfolio;
construction  (excluding  construction/permanent  loans) and land loans  totaled
$3.5  million  or  1.1%  of  the  Savings  Bank's  total  loan  portfolio;   and
multi-family  mortgage  loans totaled $4.5 million or 1.4% of the Savings Bank's
total loan portfolio.  Consumer,  commercial and other loans held by the Savings
Bank,  which  principally  consist  of home  equity  loans,  deposit,  consumer,
commercial and other loans, totaled $37.5 million or 11.4% of the Savings Bank's
total loan portfolio at December 31, 1997.

Purchase of Mortgage Loans.  The Savings Bank has, from time to time,  purchased
mortgage loans originated by other lenders.  At December 31, 1997, $3.7 million,
or 1.1% of the  Savings  Bank's  total loan  portfolio  consisted  of  purchased
mortgage  loans  or loan  participations.  Purchased  mortgage  loans  consisted
primarily of one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans.

Secondary  Market  Activities.  The Savings Bank  participates  in the secondary
market  through  a  correspondent  relationship,  originating  loans  (primarily
30-year  fixed-rate  loans)  which  are  funded by the  investor  correspondent.
Funding by the correspondent eliminates the Savings Bank's interest-rate risk on
such loans.  Such loans are closed on the Savings  Bank's  documents  with funds
provided by the investor  correspondent  at closing  with all credit  conditions
established by the investor  correspondent being satisfied prior to the issuance
of a  loan  commitment.  The  Savings  Bank  receives  a  fee  for  originating,
processing  and  closing  the  loans and  reports  the loans to the OTS as loans
originated and sold. In the year ended December 31, 1997, such loans amounted to
$2.5 million or 2.1% of total mortgage loans originated.

One-to-Four-Family Mortgage Lending. The Savings Bank's primary lending emphasis
is on the  origination  of first  mortgage  loans secured by  one-to-four-family
residences within its primary lending area. Such residences are primarily single
family homes,  including  condominium and townhouses,  that serve as the primary
residence  of the owner.  To a lesser  degree,  the Savings  Bank makes loans on
residences used as second homes or as investments.  The Savings Bank also offers
second mortgage loans which are underwritten  applying the same standards as for
first mortgage loans.

In the years ended  December 31, 1995,  1996 and 1997,  the Savings Bank's total
mortgage loan originations  amounted to $50.3 million,  $74.4 million and $118.1
million,  respectively, of which $46.1 million, $62.9 million and $87.7 million,
respectively, were secured by one-to-four-family properties.

At  December  31,   1997,   74.6%  of  total  loans   receivable   consisted  of
one-to-four-family residential loans, of which 77.4% were ARM loans. The Savings
Bank's ARM loans may carry an initial interest rate which is less than the fully
indexed rate for the loan.  The initial  discounted  rate is  determined  by the
Savings Bank in accordance with market and competitive factors. The Savings Bank
offers one-,  three- and five-year ARM loans which adjust by a maximum of 2% per
adjustment  period,  with lifetime caps on increases of 5% to 6%, depending upon
the program chosen.

The Savings  Bank's  policy on  one-to-four-family  residential  mortgage  loans
generally is to lend up to 80% of the appraised  value of property  securing the
loan,  or up to 95% if private  mortgage  insurance is obtained on the amount of
the loan which exceeds 80%.

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending.  As of December 31, 1997, $38.0
million,  or 11.5% of the  Savings  Bank's  total loan  portfolio  consisted  of
commercial  real estate loans and $4.5  million,  or 1.4% of the Savings  Bank's
total loan portfolio, consisted of multi-family residential loans.

The  commercial  real estate loans in the Savings  Bank's  portfolio  consist of
fixed-rate and ARM loans which were originated at prevailing  market rates.  The
Savings  Bank's policy has been to originate  commercial or  multi-family  loans
only in its primary market area.  Commercial and multi-family  residential loans
are generally made in amounts up to 75% of the appraised  value of the property.
In making such loans,  the Savings Bank  primarily  considers  the net operating
income  generated by the real estate to support the debt service,  the financial
resources  and  income  level and  managerial  expertise  of the  borrower,  the
marketability of the property and the Savings Bank's lending experience with the
borrower.

Commercial  Loans.  As of December 31, 1997, $4.6 million or 1.4% of the Savings
Bank's total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans.

Construction  and Land Loans.  The Savings Bank originates  loans to finance the
construction  of  one-to-four-family   homes  and,  to  a  much  lesser  extent,
originates loans for the acquisition and development of land (either  unimproved
land or improved  lots) on which the purchaser  can then build.  At December 31,
1997,  construction  (excluding  construction/permanent  loans)  and land  loans
totaled $3.5 million or 1.1% of the Savings Bank's total loan portfolio.
<PAGE>

At December 31, 1997,  the Savings Bank had loans in process  (undisbursed  loan
proceeds of construction  loans) of $12.3 million.  Of that amount, $9.3 million
was secured by  residential  mortgages  and $3.0 million  secured by  commercial
mortgages.  The Savings Bank makes residential  construction loans to homeowners
on  a  long-term  basis  with  amortization   beginning  at  the  conclusion  of
construction,  usually a period of about six  months.  Such loans are carried in
the   one-to-four-family   category  and  are  not   separately   classified  as
construction  loans.  Residential  construction loans to builders are carried in
the construction and land category.




                                        9

<PAGE>
Construction   and   land   loans   also   include    construction   loans   for
one-to-four-family  residential  property  for which the  borrower  will  obtain
permanent  financing  from  another  lender.  Such  loans  bear a fixed  rate of
interest that equals prime plus 2.0% during the construction period. The Savings
Bank  obtains a commitment  for the  permanent  financing  from the other lender
prior to originating the construction loan.

Consumer  Lending.  At December 31, 1997,  $32.8 million or 10.0% of the Savings
Bank's total loan portfolio  consisted of consumer loans,  including home equity
loans and lines of credit for consumer  purposes and, to a lesser  extent,  home
improvement loans and secured and unsecured personal loans.

The Savings  Bank's  home  equity  loans are  originated  on  one-to-four-family
residences,  either on a  fixed-rate  basis with terms of up to 10 years or as a
balloon loan with terms up to five years with fifteen year amortization periods.
Those loans are generally limited to aggregate  outstanding  indebtedness on the
property  securing the loan of 80% of the loan to value ratio.  The Savings Bank
also offers  home  equity  lines of credit,  which bear  prime-based  adjustable
interest  rates with terms up to fifteen  years.  Such loans  generally  require
monthly payments of interest plus 1.5% of the balance outstanding.

Consumer loans are offered primarily on a fixed-rate,  short-term basis.  Except
for second  mortgage  loans which are  underwritten  pursuant  to the  standards
applicable to one-to-four-family  residential loans, the underwriting  standards
employed by the Savings Bank for consumer loans include a  determination  of the
applicant's  payment  history on other debts and an assessment of the borrower's
ability to make payments on the proposed loan and other indebtedness.

Loan  Approval  and  Authority.  Mortgage  loan  approval  authority  for  loans
exceeding  $750,000  has been  retained  by the Board of  Directors  which meets
weekly in its capacity as the Executive  Committee of the Board to consider loan
recommendations  of the Loan  Committee.  The Loan Committee is comprised of two
outside directors,  the President and the Senior Lending Officers of the Savings
Bank.  Management has been delegated  authority to approve mortgage loans,  home
equity  loans,  home  equity  lines of credit and secured  consumer  loans up to
$750,000.

The Savings  Bank's policy is to require title and hazard  insurance on all real
estate loans,  except home equity loans for which a title search is conducted in
lieu of obtaining title insurance. Borrowers may be permitted to pay real estate
taxes and hazard  insurance  premiums  applicable to the secured  property for a
mortgage  loan.  In some  instances,  borrowers may be required to advance funds
together  with each  payment of  principal  and  interest  to a mortgage  escrow
account from which the Savings Bank makes  disbursements  for items such as real
estate taxes, hazard insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums.

Asset Quality

Delinquent  Loans  and  Nonperforming  Assets.  Loans  are  generally  placed on
nonaccrual  status when the  collection  of  principal or interest is 90 days or
more past due, or earlier if  collection is deemed  uncertain.  The Savings Bank
provides  an  allowance  for  accrued  interest  deemed  uncollectible.  Accrued
interest  receivable is reported net of the allowance for uncollected  interest.
Loans may be reinstated to accrual status when all payments are brought  current
and, in the opinion of  management,  collection of the remaining  balance can be
reasonably expected.

At  December  31,  1997,  the  Savings  Bank had no  accruing  loans  which were
contractually  past  due 90 days or more as to  principal  and  interest  and no
troubled  debt  restructurings  as defined by Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 15.  Nonaccrual  loans for which interest has been reduced totaled
approximately  $242,000,  $666,000 and $174,000 at December 31, 1997,  1996, and
1995,  respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 1997, interest income that
would  have  been  recorded  under the  original  terms of  nonaccrual  loans at
December 31, 1997 and interest income actually recognized is summarized below:


     Interest income that would have been recorded         $ 21,192

Classified Assets. Federal regulations and the Savings Bank's policy require the
classification  of loans and other assets,  such as debt and equity  securities,
considered  to be of  lesser  quality  as  "substandard",  "doubtful"  or "loss"
assets. An asset is considered  "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by
the  current net worth and paying  capacity of the obligor or of the  collateral
pledged,  if  any.  "Substandard"  assets  include  those  characterized  by the
"distinct  possibility"  that the  institution  will sustain  "some loss" if the
deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the
weaknesses   inherent  in  those  classified   "substandard,"   with  the  added
characteristic  that the weaknesses  present make  "collection or liquidation in
full", on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, "highly

<PAGE>

questionable and improbable."  Assets  classified as "loss" are those considered
"uncollectible"  and of such  little  value  that  their  continuance  as assets
without  the  establishment  of a specific  loss  reserve is not  warranted.  In
addition, the Savings Bank's policies require that assets which do not currently
expose the insured  institution to sufficient risk to warrant  classification as
substandard  but possess other  weaknesses are designated  "special  mention" by
management.






                                       12

<PAGE>
If an asset is  classified,  the estimated fair value of the asset is determined
and if that  value is less  than  the then  carrying  value  of the  asset,  the
difference is  established as a specific  reserve.  If an asset is classified as
loss, the amount of the asset  classified as loss is reserved.  General reserves
or  general  valuation  allowances  represent  loss  allowances  which have been
established to recognize the inherent risk  associated  with lending  activities
but, unlike specific reserves, are not allocated to particular assets.

The  following  table sets forth  information  concerning  the number and dollar
amount of loans and real estate owned  classified as  "substandard" at the dates
indicated.  No loans or real estate  owned were  classified  "special  mention,"
"doubtful" or "loss" at those dates.

Allowance  for Loan  Losses.  The Savings  Bank's  allowance  for loan losses is
established  and  maintained  through  a  provision  for  loan  losses  based on
management's  evaluation  of the risk  inherent  in its loan  portfolio  and the
condition  of the  local  economy  in  the  Savings  Bank's  market  area.  Such
evaluation,  which  includes a review of all loans on which full  collectibility
may not be reasonably  assured,  considers,  among other matters,  the estimated
fair value of the underlying collateral, economic and regulatory conditions, and
other  factors that warrant  recognition  in providing for an adequate loan loss
allowance.  Although management believes it uses the best information  available
to make  determinations  with respect to the Savings  Bank's  allowance for loan
losses,  future  adjustments  may  be  necessary  if  economic  conditions  vary
substantially from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the
initial determinations or if other circumstances change.

Investment Activities

The investment  policy of the Savings Bank, which is established by the Board of
Directors and  implemented by the Chief  Executive  Officer who is designated as
the Investment Officer, is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity,
to generate a favorable return on investments  without  incurring undue interest
rate and credit risk, and to complement  the Savings Bank's lending  activities.
In  establishing  its  investment  strategies,  the Savings Bank  considers  its
business and growth plans, the economic environment,  the types of securities to
be held and other factors.  Federally  chartered  savings  institutions have the
authority  to  invest  in  various  types of  assets,  including  U.S.  Treasury
obligations,  securities of various federal  agencies,  certain  certificates of
deposit of insured banks and savings institutions,  certain bankers acceptances,
repurchase  agreements,  loans on federal funds, and, subject to certain limits,
commercial paper and mutual funds.

On January 1, 1994,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 115.  That  statement  requires  investment  and  mortgage-backed
securities  that the  Company  has the  positive  intent and  ability to hold to
maturity  to be  classified  as  held-to-maturity  securities  and  reported  at
amortized  cost.  Securities  that are held  principally for selling in the near
term are to be classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with
unrealized  gains and losses included in earnings.  Securities not classified as
either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are to be classified as
available-for-sale  securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported in a separate  component  of
stockholders' equity.

Mortgage-Backed Securities

The Savings Bank invests in  collateralized  mortgage  obligations  ("CMOs") and
mortgage-backed  securities  such as government  pass-through  certificates.  At
December 31,  1997,  the Savings  Bank's  mortgage-backed  securities  portfolio
totaled $38.3 million,  or 9.6% of total assets. The  weighted-average  interest
rate on the total mortgage-backed  securities portfolio at December 31, 1997 was
6.78%. The mortgage-backed securities are not due at a single maturity date, and
accordingly, contractual maturity information is not presented herein. CMOs, net
of related  premiums  and  discounts,  totaled  $15.3  million or 39.9% of total
mortgage-backed securities.

CMOs are typically issued by a special purpose entity, which may be organized in
any  of  a  variety  of  legal  forms,  such  as a  trust,  a  corporation  or a
partnership.  The entity  combines pools of pass-through  securities,  which are
used to collateralize the mortgage related securities.  Once combined,  the cash
flows can be divided into  different  "tranches"  or  "classes"  of  securities,
thereby  creating  more  predictable  average  lives for each  security than the
underlying  pass-through  pools.  Under this  security  structure  all principal
repayments   from  the   various   mortgage   pools  can  be   allocated   to  a
mortgage-related  securities class or classes  structured to have priority until
it has been paid off.  Thus,  these  securities  are  designed  to  address  the
reinvestment  concerns associated with mortgage-backed  security  pass-throughs,
namely that they tend to pay off more  rapidly  when  interest  rates fall.  The
Savings  Bank's CMOs have  coupon  rates  ranging  from 4.00% to 7.53% and had a
weighted average yield of 6.14% at December 31, 1997.

The Savings  Bank's  policy is to purchase CMOs rated AA or better by nationally
recognized  rating services.  The majority of the CMOs owned by the Savings Bank
are insured or guaranteed either directly or indirectly, through mortgage-backed
securities underlying the obligations issued by the FNMA, FHLMC or GNMA.

At December 31, 1997,  the Savings Bank had $15.3  million in CMOs  representing
3.8% of total assets.  Of that amount,  $9.1 million or 59.4% had floating rates
with caps ranging from 8.50% to 12.65% and which adjust on a monthly basis.

Other mortgage-backed  securities,  net, totaled $23.0 million or 60.1% of total
mortgage-backed   securities.   Other  mortgage-backed   securities  consist  of
pass-through certificates issued by the Government National Mortgage Association
("GNMA"),  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  ("FHLMC") and the Federal
National Mortgage Association ("FNMA").

At December 31, 1997, the Savings Bank had mortgage-backed  securities available
for sale with an aggregate  carrying value of $9.3 million,  consisting of CMOs,
FHLMC five year balloons and FNMA certificates.

Borrowings

The Savings Bank is authorized to obtain advances from the FHLB of Atlanta which
generally would be  collateralized  by a blanket lien against the Savings Bank's
mortgage  portfolio.  Such  advances may be made  pursuant to several  different
credit  programs,  each  of  which  has its  own  interest  rate  and  range  of
maturities.  The maximum  amount that the FHLB of Atlanta will advance to member
institutions,  including  the Savings  Bank,  for  purposes  other than  meeting
withdrawals, fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the
OTS and the FHLB of Atlanta.  At December 31,  1997,  the Savings Bank had $30.0
million in FHLB advances outstanding.

From time to time,  the  Savings  Bank enters into  agreements  with  nationally
recognized  primary  securities  dealers  under  which the  Savings  Bank  sells
securities subject to repurchase  agreements.  Such agreements are accounted for
as  borrowings  by the Savings Bank and are secured by the  securities  sold. At
December  31,  1997,  the  Savings  Bank  did  not  have  any  such   borrowings
outstanding.

The  following  table sets forth  certain  information  relating  to the Savings
Bank's borrowings at the dates indicated:

Subsidiary Activities

The  Savings  Bank  has  one  wholly-owned   subsidiary,   Lake  County  Service
Corporation.  Lake County  Service  Corporation  was formed to develop a 100-lot
subdivision and is now substantially inactive, having sold all but one lot. Lake
County Service  Corporation  also owns an 8.4 acre  commercial  parcel and a one
acre lot adjoining the Savings Bank's main office.

<PAGE>
Personnel

As of December 31,  1997,  the Savings Bank had 127  full-time  employees  and 9
part-time  employees.   The  employees  are  not  represented  by  a  collective
bargaining  unit  and the  Savings  Bank  considers  its  relationship  with its
employees to be good.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

General

The Company,  as a savings and loan holding company, is required to file certain
reports with, and otherwise  comply with the rules and regulations of the Office
of Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS") under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended (the
"HOLA").  In  addition,  the  activities  of savings  institutions,  such as the
Savings  Bank,  are governed by the HOLA and the Federal  Deposit  Insurance Act
("FDI Act").

The Savings Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision
by the OTS,  as its  primary  federal  regulator,  and the FDIC,  as the deposit
insurer.  The Savings  Bank is a member of the Federal  Home Loan Bank  ("FHLB")
System and its  deposit  accounts  are  insured up to  applicable  limits by the
Savings  Association  Insurance  Fund ("SAIF")  managed by the FDIC. The Savings
Bank must file reports with the OTS and the FDIC  concerning  its activities and
financial  condition  in addition to  obtaining  regulatory  approvals  prior to
entering into certain  transactions  such as mergers with, or  acquisitions  of,
other  savings   institutions.   The  OTS  and/or  the  FDIC  conduct   periodic
examinations to test the Savings Bank's safety and soundness and compliance with
various regulatory  requirements.  This regulation and supervision establishes a
comprehensive  framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is
intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.  The
regulatory structure also gives the regulatory  authorities extensive discretion
in connection with their supervisory and enforcement  activities and examination
policies,  including  policies with respect to the  classification of assets and
the  establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory  purposes.  Any
change in such  regulatory  requirements  and policies,  whether by the OTS, the
FDIC or the Congress,  could have a material adverse impact on the Company,  the
Savings  Bank and  their  operations.  Certain  of the  regulatory  requirements
applicable  to the  Savings  Bank and to the  Company  are  referred to below or
elsewhere  herein.  The  description  of statutory  provisions  and  regulations
applicable to savings institutions and their holding companies set forth in this
Form 10-K does not purport to be a complete  description  of such  statutes  and
regulations and their effects on the Savings Bank and the Company.

Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a nondiversified  unitary savings and loan holding company within
the meaning of the HOLA.  As a unitary  savings and loan  holding  company,  the
Company  generally  is not  restricted  under  existing  laws as to the types of
business  activities  in which it may engage,  provided  that the  Savings  Bank
continues  to  be a  qualified  thrift  lender  ("QTL").  See  "Federal  Savings
Institution Regulation - QTL Test." Upon any non-supervisory  acquisition by the
Company of another  savings  institution or savings bank that meets the QTL test
and is deemed to be a savings institution by the OTS, the Company would become a

<PAGE>
multiple  savings and loan holding company (if the acquired  institution is held
as a separate  subsidiary) and would be subject to extensive  limitations on the
types of  business  activities  in which it could  engage.  The HOLA  limits the
activities of a multiple  savings and loan holding  company and its  non-insured
institution  subsidiaries  primarily to activities  permissible for bank holding
companies  under  Section  4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding  Company Act ("BHC Act"),
subject to the prior approval of the OTS, and certain  activities  authorized by
OTS  regulation,  and no multiple  savings and loan holding  company may acquire
more than 5% the voting stock of a company engaged in impermissible activities.


                                       24
<PAGE>
The HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding  company,  directly or indirectly,
or through one or more  subsidiaries,  from acquiring more than 5% of the voting
stock of another savings  institution or holding company thereof,  without prior
written  approval of the OTS or acquiring  or retaining  control of a depository
institution  that is not  insured by the FDIC.  In  evaluating  applications  by
holding  companies to acquire  savings  institutions,  the OTS must consider the
financial  and  managerial  resources  and future  prospects  of the company and
institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance
funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.

The OTS is  prohibited  from  approving any  acquisition  that would result in a
multiple savings and loan holding company  controlling  savings  institutions in
more than one state,  subject to two exceptions:  (i) the approval of interstate
supervisory  acquisitions  by savings and loan  holding  companies  and (ii) the
acquisition  of a savings  institution in another state if the laws of the state
of the target savings  institution  specifically  permit such acquisitions.  The
states  vary in the  extent to which they  permit  interstate  savings  and loan
holding company acquisitions.

Although savings and loan holding  companies are not subject to specific capital
requirements  or  specific  restrictions  on the payment of  dividends  or other
capital  distributions,  HOLA does  prescribe  such  restrictions  on subsidiary
savings  institutions as described  below.  The Savings Bank must notify the OTS
thirty days before  declaring  any  dividend to the Company.  In  addition,  the
financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary  institution is a matter
that is evaluated by the OTS and the agency has authority to order  cessation of
activities or divestiture of subsidiaries  deemed to pose a threat to the safety
and soundness of the institution.

Federal Savings Institution Regulation

Capital  Requirements.  The OTS capital regulations require savings institutions
to meet three minimum  capital  standards:  a 1.5% tangible  capital ratio, a 3%
leverage  (core) capital ratio and an 8% risk-based  capital ratio. In addition,
the prompt  corrective  action  standards  discussed  below also  establish,  in
effect,  a minimum 2% tangible  capital  standard,  a 4% leverage (core) capital
ratio (3% for  institutions  receiving the highest rating on the CAMEL financial
institution  rating system),  and, together with the risk-based capital standard
itself,  a 4% Tier I  risk-based  capital  standard.  Core capital is defined as
common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock and related surplus,  and minority interests in equity
accounts  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  less  intangibles  other than  certain
mortgage  servicing  rights and credit card  relationships.  The OTS regulations
also require  that,  in meeting the  tangible,  leverage  (core) and  risk-based
capital  standards,  institutions must generally deduct investments in and loans
to subsidiaries  engaged in activities as principal that are not permissible for
a national bank.

The  risk-based   capital  standard  for  savings   institutions   requires  the
maintenance of Tier I (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital
and  supplementary  capital)  to  risk-weighted  assets  of at  least 4% and 8%,
respectively.  In determining the amount of  risk-weighted  assets,  all assets,
including  certain  off-balance  sheet assets,  are  multiplied by a risk-weight
factor of 0% to 100%,  as assigned by the OTS  capital  regulation  based on the
risks OTS believes are inherent in the type of asset.  The  components of Tier I
(core)  capital are  equivalent to those  discussed  earlier.  The components of
supplementary  capital currently include cumulative  preferred stock,  long-term
perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible  securities,  subordinated debt
and  intermediate  preferred  stock and the  allowance for loan and lease losses
limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted  assets.  Overall,  the amount of
supplementary  capital  included as part of total capital  cannot exceed 100% of
core capital.

                                       25
<PAGE>
The OTS regulatory  capital  requirements also incorporate an interest rate risk
component.  Savings institutions with "above normal" interest rate risk exposure
are subject to a deduction from total capital for purposes of calculating  their
risk-based capital requirements.  A savings institution's  interest rate risk is
measured  by the decline in the net  portfolio  value of its assets  (i.e.,  the
difference  between  incoming  and outgoing  discounted  cash flows from assets,
liabilities  and  off-balance   sheet   contracts)  that  would  result  from  a
hypothetical  200 basis point  increase or  decrease  in market  interest  rates
divided  by the  estimated  economic  value  of  the  institution's  assets.  In
calculating  its total  capital  under the  risk-based  capital  rule, a savings
institution whose measured interest rate risk exposure exceeds 2% must deduct an
amount equal to one-half of the difference  between the  institution's  measured
interest rate risk and 2%,  multiplied by the  estimated  economic  value of the
institution's  assets.  The  Director  of the OTS may  waive or defer a  savings
institution's  interest rate risk component on a  case-by-case  basis. A savings
institution with assets of less than $300 million and risk-based  capital ratios
in excess of 12% is not subject to the interest rate risk component,  unless the
OTS  determines   otherwise.   For  the  present  time,  the  OTS  has  deferred
implementation  of the interest rate risk  component.  At December 31, 1997, the
Savings Bank met each of its capital requirements and it is anticipated that the
Savings Bank will not be subject to the interest rate risk component.

The following table presents the Savings Bank's capital position at December 31,
1997.

Prompt  Corrective  Regulatory  Action.  Under the OTS prompt  corrective action
regulations,  the OTS is required to take certain  supervisory  actions  against
undercapitalized   institutions,   the  severity  of  which   depends  upon  the
institution's degree of undercapitalization. Generally, a savings institution is
considered  "well  capitalized"  if its ratio of total capital to  risk-weighted
assets is at least  10%,  its ratio of Tier I (core)  capital  to  risk-weighted
assets is at least 6%, its ratio of core capital to total assets is at least 5%,
and it is not  subject to any order or  directive  by the OTS to meet a specific
capital  level.  A  savings  institution  generally  is  considered  "adequately
capitalized" if its ratio of total capital to  risk-weighted  assets is at least
8%, its ratio of Tier I (core) capital to  risk-weighted  assets is at least 4%,
and its  ratio  of core  capital  to  total  assets  is at  least  4% (3% if the
institution receives the highest CAMEL rating). A savings institution that has a
ratio of total capital to risk-weighted  assets of less than 8%, a ratio of Tier

<PAGE>

I (core)  capital  to  risk-weighted  assets  of less than 4% or a ratio of core
capital to total  assets of less than 4% (3% or less for  institutions  with the
highest  examination rating) is considered to be  "undercapitalized."  A savings
institution  that has a total  risk-based  capital  ratio less than 6%, a Tier 1
capital  ratio  of less  than 3% or a  leverage  ratio  that is less  than 3% is
considered to be "significantly undercapitalized" and a savings institution that
has a tangible  capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be
"critically  undercapitalized."  Subject  to a  narrow  exception,  the  banking
regulator is required to appoint a receiver or  conservator  for an  institution
that is  "critically  undercapitalized."  The  regulation  also  provides that a
capital restoration plan must be filed with the OTS within 45 days of the date a
savings   institution   receives   notice   that   it   is   "undercapitalized,"
"significantly  undercapitalized" or "critically  undercapitalized."  Compliance
with the plan must be guaranteed  by any parent  holding  company.  In addition,
numerous  mandatory  supervisory  actions  become  immediately  applicable to an
undercapitalized   institution,   including,   but  not  limited  to,  increased
monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth,  capital  distributions and
expansion.  The OTS  could  also  take  any  one of a  number  of  discretionary
supervisory actions,

                                       26

<PAGE>
including  the issuance of a capital  directive  and the  replacement  of senior
executive officers and directors.

Insurance  of Deposit  Accounts.  Deposits  of the  Savings  Bank are  presently
insured by the SAIF.  On September 30, 1996,  the President  signed into law the
Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 (the "Funds Act") which, among other things,
imposed a special one-time assessment on SAIF member institutions, including the
Savings  Bank,  to  recapitalize  the SAIF.  The SAIF was  undercapitalized  due
primarily to a statutory  requirement  that SAIF members make  payments on bonds
issued in the late 1980s by the Financing  Corporation  ("FICO") to recapitalize
the  predecessor  to the SAIF.  As required by the Funds Act, the FDIC imposed a
special  assessment of 65.7 basis points on SAIF assessable  deposits held as of
March 31, 1995, payable November 27, 1996 (the "SAIF Special  Assessment").  The
SAIF Special  Assessment was recognized by the Savings Bank as an expense in the
quarter ended  September 30, 1996 and was  generally  tax  deductible.  The SAIF
Special  Assessment  recorded by the Savings Bank  amounted to $1.7 million on a
pre-tax basis and $1.0 million on an after-tax basis.

The Funds Act also spreads the  obligations for payment of the FICO bonds across
all SAIF and Bank  Insurance  Fund  ("BIF")  members.  The BIF is the fund which
primarily  insures  commercial bank deposits.  Beginning on January 1, 1997, BIF
deposits  were  assessed  for a FICO  payment  of 1.3 basis  points,  while SAIF
deposits  pay 6.4  basis  points.  Full pro rata  sharing  of the FICO  payments
between BIF and SAIF members will occur on the earlier of January 1, 2000 or the
date the BIF and SAIF are merged.  The Funds Act specifies that the BIF and SAIF
will be merged on January 1, 1999, provided no savings associations remain as of
that time.

As a  result  of the  Funds  Act,  the  FDIC  voted to  effectively  lower  SAIF
assessments to 0 to 27 basis points as of January 1, 1997, a range comparable to
that of BIF members.  SAIF members will also  continue to make the FICO payments
described  above.   Management  cannot  predict  the  level  of  FDIC  insurance
assessments on an on-going basis,  whether the savings  association charter will
be eliminated or whether the BIF and SAIF will eventually be merged.

The Savings Bank's  assessment rate for fiscal 1997 was 6.4 basis points and the
premium paid for 1997 was  $147,000.  A significant  increase in SAIF  insurance
premiums  would  likely have an adverse  effect on the  operating  expenses  and
results of operations of the Savings Bank.

Under the FDI Act,  insurance of deposits may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a
finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound  practices,  is in
an unsafe or unsound  condition  to  continue  operations  or has  violated  any
applicable law, regulation,  rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the
OTS. The management of the Savings Bank does not know of any practice, condition
or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

Thrift  Rechartering  Legislation.  The Funds Act provides that the BIF and SAIF
will merge on January 1, 1999 if there are no more  savings  associations  as of
that date.  Various proposals to eliminate the federal thrift charter,  create a
uniform financial  institutions charter and abolish the OTS have been introduced
in Congress. Some bills would require federal savings institutions to convert to
a national bank or some type of state charter by a specified  date or they would
automatically  become national banks.  Under some proposals,  converted  federal

<PAGE>

thrifts  would  generally  be  required  to conform  their  activities  to those
permitted for the charter selected and divestiture of nonconforming assets would
be required over a two year period, subject to two possible one-year extensions.
State chartered  thrifts would become subject to the same federal  regulation as
applies  to state  commercial  banks.  A more  recent  bill  passed by the House
Banking  Committee  would  allow  savings  institutions  to continue to exercise
activities  being  conducted when they convert to a bank regardless of whether a
national  bank could  engage in the  activity.  Holding  companies  for  savings
institutions  would become subject to the same  regulation as holding  companies
that control commercial banks, with some limited grandfathering,  including some
savings and loan holding company  activities.  The grandfathering  would be lost
under  certain  circumstances  such as a change in control of the  Company.  The
Savings Bank is unable to predict whether such legislation would be enacted, the

                                       28
<PAGE>
extent to which the legislation would restrict or disrupt its operations.

Loans to One  Borrower.  Under  the HOLA,  savings  institutions  are  generally
subject to the limits on loans to one  borrower  applicable  to national  banks.
Generally, savings institutions may not make a loan or extend credit to a single
or related  group of  borrowers in excess of 15% of its  unimpaired  capital and
surplus.  An additional  amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired  capital
and surplus, if such loan is secured by readily-marketable  collateral, which is
defined to include certain  financial  instruments and bullion.  At December 31,
1997,  the Savings  Bank's limit on loans to one borrower was $6.9  million.  At
December 31, 1997, the Savings Bank's largest aggregate  outstanding  balance of
loans to one borrower was $4.2 million.

QTL Test. The HOLA requires  savings  institutions to meet a QTL test. Under the
QTL test,  a savings and loan  association  must  either  qualify as a "domestic
building  and loan  association"  as defined  in the  Internal  Revenue  Code or
maintain  at  least  65% of its  "portfolio  assets"  (total  assets  less:  (i)
specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets;  (ii) intangibles,  including
goodwill;  and (iii) the value of property used to conduct  business) in certain
"qualified  thrift  investments"  (primarily  residential  mortgages and related
investments,  including certain mortgage-backed securities) in at least 9 months
out of each 12 month period.

A savings  institution  that fails the QTL test is subject to certain  operating
restrictions  and may be required to convert to a bank  charter.  As of December
31, 1997, the Savings Bank maintained 82.9% of its portfolio assets in qualified
thrift  investments and,  therefore,  met the QTL test.  Recent  legislation has
expanded  the  extent to which  education  loans,  credit  card  loans and small
business loans may be considered "qualified thrift investments."

Limitation on Capital Distributions. OTS regulations impose limitations upon all
capital distributions by savings institutions,  such as cash dividends, payments
to  repurchase  or otherwise  acquire its shares,  payments to  shareholders  of
another institution in a cash-out merger and other distributions charged against
capital.  The rule  establishes  three  tiers of  institutions,  which are based
primarily on the  institution's  capital levels. An institution that exceeds all
fully  phased-in  capital  requirements  before  and  after a  proposed  capital
distribution  ("Tier 1 Bank") and has not been  advised by the OTS that it is in
need of more than normal  supervision,  could,  after  prior  notice but without
obtaining approval of the OTS, make capital distributions during a calendar year
equal to the greater of (i) 100% of its net earnings to date during the calendar
year plus the amount that would reduce by one-half its "surplus  capital  ratio"
(the  excess  capital  over its fully  phased-in  capital  requirements)  at the
beginning  of the  calendar  year or (ii) 75% of its net income for the previous
four  quarters.   Any  additional  capital  distributions  would  require  prior
regulatory  approval.  In the event the Savings  Bank's  capital  fell below its
regulatory  requirements or the OTS notified it that it was in need of more than
normal  supervision,  the Savings Bank's  ability to make capital  distributions
could be  restricted.  In addition,  the OTS could  prohibit a proposed  capital
distribution  by any  institution,  which would  otherwise  be  permitted by the
regulation,  if the OTS determines that such  distribution  would  constitute an
unsafe or unsound practice. In December 1994, the OTS proposed amendments to its
capital  distribution  regulation that would generally  authorize the payment of
capital  distributions  without OTS approval  provided that the payment does not
cause the  institution to be  undercapitalized  within the meaning of the prompt
corrective  action  regulation.  However,  institutions  in  a  holding  company
structure would still have a prior notice requirement. At December 31, 1997, the
Savings Bank was a Tier 1 Bank.
<PAGE>

Liquidity.  The Savings Bank is required to maintain an average daily balance of
specified  liquid assets equal to a monthly average of not less than a specified
percentage of its net withdrawable deposit accounts plus short-term  borrowings.
This liquidity requirement was 5% for fiscal 1997, but is subject to change from
time to time by the OTS to any amount  within  the range of 4% to 10%  depending
upon economic conditions and the savings flows of member institutions.  In 1997,
OTS  regulations  also required each savings  institution to maintain an average
daily balance of short-term liquid assets of at least 1% of the total of its net
withdrawable deposit accounts and borrowings

                                       28

<PAGE>
payable in one year or less.  Monetary  penalties  may be imposed for failure to
meet these liquidity  requirements.  The OTS has recently  lowered the liquidity
requirement  from  5% to 4%  and  eliminated  the  1%  short-term  liquid  asset
requirement.  The Savings Bank's liquidity ratio for December 31, 1997 was 8.7%,
which  exceeded  the  applicable  requirement.  The Savings  Bank has never been
subject to monetary penalties for failure to meet its liquidity requirement.

Assessments.  Savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the OTS to
fund the agency's  operations.  The general  assessments,  paid on a semi-annual
basis,  are computed  upon the savings  institution's  total  assets,  including
consolidated  subsidiaries,  as reported in the Savings Bank's latest  quarterly
thrift financial report. The assessments paid by the Savings Bank for the fiscal
years  ended   December  31,  1997  and  1996  totalled   $87,000  and  $83,000,
respectively.

Branching.  OTS regulations permit nationwide  branching by federally  chartered
savings  institutions  to the extent  allowed by federal  statute.  This permits
federal   savings   institutions  to  establish   interstate   networks  and  to
geographically  diversify their loan  portfolios and lines of business.  The OTS
authority  preempts any state law  purporting  to regulate  branching by federal
savings institutions.

Transactions  with Related  Parties.  The Savings Bank's  authority to engage in
transactions  with  related  parties or  "affiliates"  (e.g..,  any company that
controls or is under common control with an  institution,  including the Company
and any non-savings institution subsidiaries) is limited by Sections 23A and 23B
of the Federal Reserve Act ("FRA").  Section 23A limits the aggregate  amount of
covered  transactions  with any  individual  affiliate to 10% of the capital and
surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions
with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings  institution's  capital and
surplus.  Certain  transactions  with  affiliates  are required to be secured by
collateral in an amount and of a type  described in Section 23A and the purchase
of low quality  assets from  affiliates  is  generally  prohibited.  Section 23B
generally  provides that certain  transactions with affiliates,  including loans
and asset purchases, must be on terms and under circumstances,  including credit
standards,  that are  substantially  the same or at  least as  favorable  to the
institution  as those  prevailing at the time for comparable  transactions  with
non-affiliated companies. In addition,  savings institutions are prohibited from
lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities  that are not permissible
for  bank  holding  companies  and  no  savings  institution  may  purchase  the
securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.

The Savings Bank's authority to extend credit to executive  officers,  directors
and 10% shareholders ("insiders"),  as well as entities such persons control, is
governed by Sections  22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and  Regulation  O  thereunder.
Among other  things,  such loans are required to be made on terms  substantially
the same as those offered to  unaffiliated  individuals  and not to involve more
than the normal risk of repayment.  Recent legislation  created an exception for
loans  made  pursuant  to a  benefit  or  compensation  program  that is  widely
available to all employees of the  institution  and does not give  preference to
insiders over other employees. Regulation O also places individual and aggregate
limits on the amount of loans the Savings  Bank may make to insiders  based,  in
part, on the Savings Bank's capital position and requires certain board approval
procedures to be followed.
<PAGE>

Enforcement.  Under the FDI Act, the OTS has primary enforcement  responsibility
over savings  institutions  and has the authority to bring  actions  against the
institution and all institution-affiliated  parties, including stockholders, and
any  attorneys,   appraisers  and   accountants   who  knowingly  or  recklessly
participate  in wrongful  action likely to have an adverse  effect on an insured
institution.  Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital
directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers  and/or  directors to
institution  of   receivership,   conservatorship   or  termination  of  deposit
insurance.  Civil  penalties  cover a wide range of violations and can amount to
$25,000 per day, or even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. Under
the FDI Act, the FDIC has the  authority to recommend to the Director of the OTS
enforcement action to be taken with respect to a particular savings institution.
If action  is not taken by the  Director,  the FDIC has  authority  to take such
action  under  certain  circumstances.  Federal  law also  establishes  criminal
penalties for certain violations.

                                       29

Standards for Safety and Soundness.  The federal  banking  agencies have adopted
Interagency   Guidelines   Prescribing   Standards   for  Safety  and  Soundness
("Guidelines")  and a final rule to  implement  safety and  soundness  standards
required  under the FDI Act. The  Guidelines  set forth the safety and soundness
standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems
at  insured  depository   institutions  before  capital  becomes  impaired.  The
standards set forth in the Guidelines  address internal controls and information
systems;  internal  audit  system;  credit  underwriting;   loan  documentation;
interest  rate  risk  exposure;  asset  growth;  asset  quality;  earnings;  and
compensation,  fees and benefits.  If the  appropriate  federal  banking  agency
determines  that an  institution  fails to meet any standard  prescribed  by the
Guidelines,  the agency may require the  institution  to submit to the agency an
acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard,  as required by the FDI
Act. The final rule establishes  deadlines for the submission and review of such
safety and soundness compliance plans when such plans are required.

Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve Board regulations  require savings  institutions to maintain
non-interest  earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW
and regular checking accounts).  The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally
required  for  most  of 1997  that  reserves  be  maintained  against  aggregate
transaction  accounts as follows: for accounts aggregating $49.3 million or less
(subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement was
3%; and for  accounts  aggregating  greater  than  $49.3  million,  the  reserve
requirement  was $1.48  million plus 10% (subject to  adjustment  by the Federal
Reserve  Board  between 8% and 14%) against  that  portion of total  transaction
accounts  in excess  of $49.3  million.  The first  $4.4  million  of  otherwise
reservable  balances  (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) were
exempted from the reserve  requirements.  The Savings Bank is in compliance with
the foregoing  requirements.  For 1998, the Federal  Reserve Board has decreased
from $49.3 to $47.8 million the amount of transaction accounts subject to the 3%
reserve  requirement and increased the amount of exempt reservable balances from
$4.4  million to $4.7  million.  The  balances  maintained  to meet the  reserve
requirements  imposed  by the  Federal  Reserve  Board  may be used  to  satisfy
liquidity requirements imposed by the OTS.

Year 2000

Management has an ongoing  program  designed to ensure that its  operational and
financial systems will not be adversely affected by year 2000 software failures,
due to processing  errors  arising from  calculations  using the year 2000 date.
Based on current estimates, the Savings Bank does not expect to incur a material
amount of expenses over the next two years on its program to redevelop, replace,
or repair its computer  applications to make them "year 2000  compliant."  While
management  believes it is doing everything  technologically  possible to assure
year 2000 compliance,  it is to some extent  dependent upon vendor  cooperation.
Management  is requiring its computer  system and software  vendors to represent
that the products provided are, or will be, year 2000 compliant, and has planned
a  program  of  testing  for  compliance.  It is  recognized  that any year 2000
compliance failures could result in additional expense to the Bank.

                           FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION

Federal Taxation

General.  The Company and the Savings Bank report their income on a consolidated
basis using the accrual method of accounting,  and are subject to federal income
taxation  in the  same  manner  as  other  corporations  with  some  exceptions,
including particularly the Savings Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed below.
The  following  discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does
not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the
Savings  Bank or the  Company.  The Savings Bank was last audited by the IRS for
the year ended December 31, 1989. For its 1997 taxable year, the Savings Bank is
subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of 34%.

Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning prior to December 31, 1995, thrift
institutions  which  qualified  under  certain   definitional  tests  and  other
conditions of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") were  permitted to
use certain  favorable  provisions to calculate  their  deductions  from taxable
income  for  annual  additions  to their bad debt  reserve.  A reserve  could be
established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans  (generally  secured
by  interests  in  real  property  improved  or to be  improved)  under  (i) the
Percentage of Taxable  Income  Method (the "PTI Method") or (ii) the  Experience
Method.  The reserve for  nonqualifying  loans was computed using the Experience
Method.

The Small  Business  Job  Protection  Act of 1996 (the  "1996  Act"),  which was
enacted on August 20, 1996,  requires  savings  institutions to recapture (i.e.,
take into income) certain portions of their  accumulated bad debt reserves.  The
1996 Act repeals the reserve  method of accounting  for bad debts  effective for
tax years beginning  after 1995.  Thrift  institutions  that would be treated as
small banks are  allowed to utilize the  Experience  Method  applicable  to such
institutions,  while thrift  institutions that are treated as large banks (those
generally  exceeding  $500  million  in  assets)  are  required  to use only the
specific charge-off method.  Thus, the PTI Method of accounting for bad debts is
no longer available for any financial institution.

A thrift institution required to change its method of computing reserves for bad
debts will treat such change as a change in method of  accounting,  initiated by
the  taxpayer,  and having  been made with the  consent of the IRS.  Any Section
481(a)  adjustment  required to be taken into income with respect to such change
generally  will be taken into income  ratably  over a  six-taxable  year period,
beginning  with the first  taxable  year  beginning  after 1995,  subject to the
residential loan requirement.

Under the residential loan requirement provision,  the recapture required by the
1996 Act is suspended for each of two successive  taxable years,  beginning with
1996,  in which the Savings  Bank  originates  a minimum of certain  residential
loans based upon the average of the principal  amounts of such loans made by the
Savings Bank during its six taxable years  preceding  its current  taxable year.
Under the 1996 Act, for its current and future taxable  years,  the Savings Bank
is permitted to make  additions to its tax bad debt reserves.  In addition,  the
Savings Bank is required to recapture  (i.e.,  take into income) over a six year
period the excess of the balance of its tax bad debt reserves as of December 31,
1995 over the balance of such  reserves as of December 31, 1987. At December 31,
1997, the Savings Bank had  approximately  $910,000 of deferred tax  liabilities
recorded for the recapture of its bad debt reserves.
<PAGE>

Distributions.  Under the 1996 Act,  if the  Savings  Bank  makes  "non-dividend
distributions"  to the Company,  such  distributions  will be considered to have
been made from the Savings Bank's  unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves (including
the balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987) to the extent thereof,  and
then from the Savings Bank's  supplemental  reserve for losses on loans,  to the
extent thereof, and an amount based on the amount distributed (but not in excess
of the amount of such  reserves)  will be included in the Savings Bank's income.
Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Savings Bank's
current and accumulated  earnings and profits,  as calculated for federal income
tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial
or complete  liquidation.  Dividends  paid out of the Savings  Bank's current or
accumulated

                                       31

<PAGE>
earnings and profits will not be so included in the Savings Bank's income.

The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount
that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount
of the distribution. Thus, if the Savings Bank makes a non-dividend distribution
to the  Company,  approximately  one  and  one-half  times  the  amount  of such
distribution  (but  not in  excess  of the  amount  of such  reserves)  would be
includable  in income for federal  income tax  purposes,  assuming a 35% federal
corporate  income tax rate.  The Savings  Bank does not intend to pay  dividends
that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.

SAIF Recapitalization  Assessment. The Funds Act levied a 65.7 cent fee on every
$100 of  thrift  deposits  held on  March  31,  1995.  For  financial  statement
purposes,  this  assessment  was  reported as an expense  for the quarter  ended
September  30, 1996.  The Funds Act  included a provision  which stated that the
amount of any special  assessment paid to capitalize SAIF under this legislation
was deductible under Section 162 of the Code in the year of payment.

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. The Code imposes a tax on alternative minimum
taxable income  ("AMTI") at a rate of 20%. For fiscal years  beginning  prior to
January  1,  1996,  the  excess  of the bad debt  reserve  deduction  using  the
percentage  of taxable  income  method over the  deduction  that would have been
allowable  under the  experience  method is  treated  as a  preference  item for
purposes of computing the AMTI.  Only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating
loss carryovers.  The adjustment to AMTI based on book income is an amount equal
to 75% of the amount by which a corporation's  adjusted current earnings exceeds
its AMTI  (determined  without regard to this  adjustment and prior to reduction
for net  operating  losses).  In addition,  for taxable  years  through 1995, an
environmental  tax of .12% of the  excess of AMTI (with  certain  modifications)
over $2.0  million is imposed  on  corporations,  including  the  Savings  Bank,
whether or not an Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT") is paid. The Savings Bank does
not expect to be subject to the AMT.

Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters. The Company may exclude from its
income 100% of dividends  received from the Savings Bank as a member of the same
affiliated group of corporations.  The corporate dividends received deduction is
generally 70% in the case of dividends  received from unaffiliated  corporations
with which the  Company and the Savings  Bank will not file a  consolidated  tax
return, except that if the Company and the Savings Bank own more than 20% of the
stock of a corporation  distributing a dividend,  80% of any dividends  received
may be deducted.

Florida  Taxation.  The Savings Bank files Florida  franchise  tax returns.  For
Florida  franchise tax purposes,  savings  institutions are presently taxed at a
rate  equal to 5.5% of  taxable  income.  For  this  purpose,  "taxable  income"
generally  means  federal  taxable  income,   subject  to  certain   adjustments
(including the addition of interest income on State and municipal  obligations).
The  Savings  Bank is not  currently  under  audit with  respect to its  Florida
franchise tax returns.

                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


The  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of  1995  evidences  Congress'
determination  that the disclosure of  forward-looking  information is desirable
for  investors  and  encourages  such  disclosure by providing a safe harbor for
forward-looking   statements  by  corporate  management.   This  Annual  Report,
including  the  Letter  to  Shareholders  and the  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis  of   Financial   Condition   and  Results  of   Operations,   contains
forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. In order to comply
with the terms of the safe harbor,  the Company  notes that a variety of factors
could cause the Company's  actual  results and  experience to differ  materially
from the anticipated  results or other  expectations  expressed in the Company's
forward-looking  statements.  The risks and  uncertainties  that may  affect the
operations,  performance,  development,  growth  projections  and results of the
Company's  business include,  but are not limited to, the growth of the economy,
interest  rate  movements,  timely  development  by the  Company  of  technology
enhancements for its products and operating  systems,  the impact of competitive
products,  services and pricing,  customer business requirements,  Congressional
legislation  and similar  matters.  Readers of this report are  cautioned not to
place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking  statements  which  are  subject  to
influence  by the named risk factors and  unanticipated  future  events.  Actual
results, accordingly, may differ materially from management expectations.

Dear Stockholders:

The annual  report is an important  way in which your Company keeps you informed
about the Company's performance.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to share
with our stockholders  and friends  information  about the Company's  operations
during the past year.

The year 1997 was very eventful.  The Company enjoyed record profits,  continued
growth, and improved performance. First Federal Savings Bank of Lake County, the
Company's  subsidiary,  finished the year with its highest loan volume,  highest
amount of total assets, and highest level of deposits.

The Company's total assets  increased by $53.8 million or 15.5% during the year,
exceeding  $400 million for the first time.  The Bank's  total loan  origination
volume in 1997 was $145.5  million,  a 62.5%  increase above the prior year. The
groundwork  for this  achievement  was laid some years  earlier.  At a strategic
planning  session in 1991, a decision was reached to place a greater emphasis on
originating  local loans. At that time, the Bank was ranked 5th in mortgage loan
origination  in  Lake  County.  As of  September  1997,  the  most  recent  data
available,  First Federal is the top ranked mortgage lender in Lake County,  and
we are understandably proud of that accomplishment.  Our goal now is to continue
our leadership in mortgage  lending.  In keeping with the Bank's strategic plan,
First Federal created a Commercial  Loan Department  during 1997 on which we are
focusing  substantial  effort. I am happy to report that our commercial  lenders
generated  $35  million  in new  loans  for the  bank in  1997.  Our  goal is to
duplicate the success of our mortgage lending in the area of commercial lending.

In the deposit area,  the Bank's total  deposits grew by $32.7 million or 11.6%,
ending the year at $315.4  million.  This is the first time that deposits at the
bank  have  exceeded  the $300  million  level.  The Bank is  placing  a greater
emphasis on attracting checking accounts,  and in January,  1998,  introduced an
entirely  new  slate  of  checking  products.  It is our  desire  to  attract  a
significant number of new checking accounts, which are considered to be the core
of a customer's banking relationship.

The Bank  understands  the 
importance of continued  growth.  In that vein, a new
branch  office  was opened in  February,  1997.  The office is located  south of
Leesburg,  in a shopping  center  anchored by a Winn-Dixie  grocery store. In an
effort to continue the Bank's expansion,  we recently acquired an outparcel at a
new Winn-Dixie  shopping center in the southernmost area of Lake County. We will
be  constructing  a new  branch  office on this site and expect the office to be
opened in late 1998.

In terms of  financial  performance,  1997 was a solid year for the  Company.  A
dramatic decline in the cost of federal deposit  insurance,  along with a strong
increase in net interest income,  resulted in improved financial results. Higher
earnings per share were accomplished during 1997,  increasing to $1.01 from $.54
per share the prior year.  The return on average  assets for the year was 1.00%,
up from .65% in 1996. The return on average  equity,  boosted by higher earnings
and the  continued  repurchase of shares,  improved to 7.18% from 3.94%.  At the
same time,  noninterest  expense as a percentage of average  assets  declined to
1.99% from 2.49% and the  operating  efficiency  ratio  improved  to 53.54% from
68.77%. In October 1997, the Company announced a five-for-three stock split. The
purpose of the split was to enhance the value of a  stockholder's  investment by
increasing the liquidity of the Company's stock. Further, in January, 1998, FFLC
announced a $.09 per share quarterly cash dividend, an increase of 25% above the
previous dividend.

During 1997, the Company made significant progress in reducing its high ratio of
capital to assets. As a result of stock  repurchases and continued  growth,  the
Company  was able to reduce  its ratio of  capital  to total  assets to 12.9% at
December  31,  1997,  from  15.5% at the prior  year-end.  Book  value per share

In looking out for events that will influence our 1998 performance, we know that
the level of  interest  rates  will  play a major  role.  Over the last  several
months,  long-term  interest rates have fallen faster than  short-term  interest
rates.  That results in a relatively  flat yield curve (the  difference  between
short-term rates and long-term  rates).  Since banks generally borrow funds from
depositors  on a  short-term  basis and lend funds to borrowers on a medium term
basis, a flat yield curve tends to impair interest income.  The financial crisis
in Asia has also had a major  impact on  interest  rates,  having  the effect of
boosting  the value of the dollar and lowering  long-term  interest  rates.  The
market's ongoing reaction to that situation will continue to influence  interest
rates.

At year-end,  there was a change in the  membership  of the Board of the Company
and the Bank.  After serving since 1974, the past three years as Chairman of the
Board,  James R. Gregg  retired as a director and was succeeded as a director by
H.D. Robuck,  Jr. Joseph J. Junod, the previous Vice Chairman and a Board member
since 1987, was elected to succeed Mr. Gregg as Chairman. Claron D. Wagner, also
a member of the Board since 1987,  was elected Vice  Chairman.  Mr. Gregg served
the  Company  and the Bank in an  excellent  fashion  during his tenure and will
continue as an Advisory Director.

During the past four years, our stockholders have provided strong support to the
Company.  We remain  committed to  profitably  serving the banking  needs of our
communities  and,  as  a  result,  provide  for  the  investment  goals  of  our
stockholders. We believe FFLC Bancorp is on course to meeting those goals and we
appreciate  the continued  support of our  stockholders  and the  communities we
serve.

Cordially yours,





Stephen T. Kurtz
President and Chief Executive Officer

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

First Federal Savings Bank of Lake County, the subsidiary of FFLC, was organized
in 1934 as a federally chartered savings and loan association and converted to a
federally  chartered  stock savings bank on January 4, 1994.  The Savings Bank's
principal  business  continues to be attracting retail deposits from the general
public and investing those deposits, together with principal repayments on loans
and investments and funds generated from operations, primarily in mortgage loans
secured by one-to-four-family,  owner-occupied homes, mortgage-backed securities
and, to a lesser  extent,  construction  loans,  consumer and other  loans,  and
multi-family  residential  mortgage loans.  In addition,  the Savings Bank holds
investments  permitted  by federal  laws and  regulations  including  securities
issued by the U.S. Government and agencies thereof.  The Savings Bank's revenues
are derived  principally from interest on its mortgage loan and  mortgage-backed
securities portfolios and interest and dividends on its investment securities.

The Savings Bank is a community-oriented  savings institution offering a variety
of  financial  services  to meet the needs of the  communities  it  serves.  The
Savings Bank's deposit gathering and lending markets are primarily  concentrated
in the  communities  surrounding  its full service  offices  located in Lake and
Sumter  counties in central  Florida.  Management  believes that its offices are
located in communities  that generally can be characterized as rural service and
retirement communities with residential neighborhoods comprised predominately of
one-to-four-family  residences.  The Savings  Bank is the oldest and largest (by
asset size)  locally-based  savings  institution in Lake County,  and serves its
market area with a wide selection of residential mortgage loans and other retail
financial  services.  Management  considers the Savings  Bank's  reputation  for
financial  strength and customer  service as a major advantage in attracting and
retaining  customers  in its  market  area and  believes  it  benefits  from its
community  orientation as well as its established deposit base and level of core
deposits.

The Savings Bank had net  earnings of $3.8  million for the year ended  December
31, 1997,  compared to net earnings of $2.2 million for the year ended  December
31,  1996.  At December  31,  1997,  the Savings Bank had total assets of $400.2
million,  an increase of 15.5% over total  assets of $346.4  million at December
31, 1996.  That increase  resulted  primarily from an $87.4  million,  or 38.3%,
increase in loans  receivable from $227.9 million at December 31, 1996 to $315.4
million at December 31, 1997,  reflecting  increased local loan demand. Cash and
cash  equivalents  increased  $5.5 million or 54.4% from $10.2  million to $15.7
million.  Mortgage-backed and investment  securities  decreased $39.9 million or
40.6% during 1997.  Deposits  increased  $32.7  million,  or 11.6%,  from $282.7
million at December 31, 1996 to $315.4  million at December  31, 1997.  Advances
from Federal Home Loan Bank increased $29.9 million, while securities sold under
agreements  to  repurchase  decreased  $8.1  million for a net increase of $21.8
million or 265.9% in  borrowings.  Stockholders'  equity  decreased $2.2 million
primarily due to  repurchases  of Holding  Company stock during 1997,  partially
offset by income from operations.

REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

General

The  operating  results of the Savings  Bank are  affected  by Federal  laws and
regulations and the Savings Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination
and supervision by the Office of Thrift Supervision  ("OTS"),  as its chartering
agency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC"), as the deposit
insurer.  The Savings  Bank is a member of the Federal  Home Loan Bank  ("FHLB")
System and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable  limits by the FDIC
under the SAIF ("Savings  Association  Insurance  Fund").  The Savings Bank must
file reports with the OTS and the FDIC  concerning  its activities and financial
condition in addition to obtaining  regulatory  approvals prior to entering into
certain  transactions  such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial
institutions.  There are periodic  examinations  by the OTS and the FDIC to test
the  Savings  Bank's  compliance  with  various  regulatory  requirements.   The
activities of savings institutions are governed by the Home Owner's Loan Act, as
amended (the "HOLA") and, in certain respects, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
(the "FDIA").  The HOLA and the FDIA were amended by the Financial  Institutions
Reform,  Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") and the Federal Deposit
Insurance  Corporation  Improvement  Act  of  1991("FDICIA").  A  more  complete
description  of the HOLA and FDIA as amended by FIRREA and FDICIA is included in
the Form 10-K.

Capital Requirements

The OTS capital regulations  require savings  institutions to meet three capital
standards: a 1.5% tangible capital standard; a 3% leverage (core capital) ratio;
and an 8% risk-based  capital  standard.  Under the OTS final rule  implementing
FDICIA,  generally, a well-capitalized  institution is defined as one that meets
the following capital standards:  a 5% tangible capital standard;  a 6% leverage
(core capital) ratio; and a 10% risk-based  capital  standard,  and has not been
notified by its federal banking agency that it is in a "troubled  condition." At
December 31, 1997,  the Savings  Bank met each of its capital  requirements,  in
each  case  on  a  fully   phased-in   basis,   and  met  the   criteria   of  a
"well-capitalized" institution as defined above.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit
insurance  premiums  according to the level of risk involved in an institution's
activities. An institution's risk category is based upon whether the institution
is  classified as "well  capitalized,"  "adequately  capitalized"  or "less than
adequately  capitalized" and one of three supervisory  subcategories within each
capital group.  The supervisory  subgroup to which an institution is assigned is
based on a supervisory  evaluation and information  which the FDIC determines to
be relevant to the institution's  financial  condition and the risk posed to the
deposit  insurance fund.  Based on its capital and supervisory  subgroups,  each
SAIF member  institution  was assigned an annual FDIC  assessment  rate for 1996
between 23 basis  points  for an  institution  in the  highest  category  (i.e.,
well-capitalized  and  healthy) and 31 basis  points for an  institution  in the
lowest  category  (i.e.,  undercapitalized  and posing  substantial  supervisory
concern).  The Savings  Bank's  assessment  rate for 1996 was .23% of  deposits.
Effective January 1, 1997, the FDIC lowered the annual assessment rates for SAIF
members to 0 to 27 basis points,  as discussed  below. The FDIC has authority to
further raise premiums if deemed  necessary.  If such action is taken,  it could
have an adverse effect on the earnings of the institution.

                                        9
<PAGE>
On September  30,  1996,  legislation  was enacted  which,  among other  things,
imposed a special one-time assessment on SAIF member institutions, including the
Savings Bank, to  recapitalize  the SAIF and spread the obligations for payments
of Financing  Corporation ("FICO") bonds across all SAIF and Bank Insurance Fund
("BIF")  members.  The FDIC  special  assessment  levied  amounted to 65.7 basis
points on SAIF  assessable  deposits  held as of March  31,  1995.  The  special
assessment  of $1.7 million  before taxes was  recognized by the Savings Bank in
the third quarter of 1996 and was tax deductible.  That  legislation  eliminated
the substantial  disparity between the amount that BIF and SAIF members had been
paying for deposit insurance premiums.

Beginning  January 1, 1997,  BIF members pay a portion of the FICO payment equal
to 1.3 basis  points on  BIF-insured  deposits,  compared  to 6.48 basis  points
payable by SAIF members on SAIF-insured  deposits, and will pay a pro rata share
of the FICO payment on the earlier of January 1, 2000 or the date upon which the
last  savings  association,  such as the  Savings  Bank,  ceases to  exist.  The
legislation  also requires BIF and SAIF to be merged by January 1, 1999 provided
that  subsequent  legislation  is adopted to eliminate  the savings  association
charter and no savings associations remain as of that time.

Effective January 1, 1997, the FDIC lowered annual SAIF assessment rates to 0 to
27 basis  points,  a range  comparable  to those of BIF members,  although  SAIF
members  continue to be subject to the higher  FICO  payments  described  above.
Management cannot predict the level of FDIC insurance  assessments on an ongoing
basis or whether the BIF and SAIF will eventually be merged.

Under the FDI Act,  insurance of deposits may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a
finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound  practices,  is in
an unsafe or unsound  condition  to  continue  operations  or has  violated  any
applicable law, regulation,  rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the
OTS. The management of the Savings Bank does not know of any practice, condition
or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

Management has an ongoing  program  designed to ensure that its  operational and
financial systems will not be adversely affected by year 2000 software failures,
due to processing  errors  arising from  calculations  using the year 2000 date.
Based on current estimates, the Savings Bank does not expect to incur a material
amount of expenses over the next two years on its program to redevelop, replace,
or repair its computer  applications to make them "year 2000  compliant."  While
management  believes it is doing everything  technologically  possible to assure
year 2000 compliance,  it is to some extent  dependent upon vendor  cooperation.
Management  is requiring its computer  system and software  vendors to represent
that the products provided are, or will be, year 2000 compliant, and has planned
a  program  of  testing  for  compliance.  It is  recognized  that any year 2000
compliance failures could result in additional expense to the Savings Bank.

CREDIT RISK

The Savings Bank's primary  business is lending on residential  real estate,  an
activity  with  the  inherent  risk of  generating  potential  loan  losses  the
magnitude of which depend on a variety of factors affecting  borrowers which are
beyond the  control of the  Savings  Bank.  The  Savings  Bank has  underwriting
guidelines and credit review procedures designed to minimize such credit losses.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The  Company's  results of operations  are  dependent  primarily on net interest
income,   which  is  the   difference   between   the   income   earned  on  its
interest-earning  assets,  primarily its loans,  mortgage-backed  securities and
investment  securities,  and its  interest-bearing  liabilities,  consisting  of
deposits and borrowings. The Company's operating expenses principally consist of
employee  compensation,  occupancy expenses,  federal deposit insurance premiums
and  other  general  and  administrative  expenses.  The  Company's  results  of
operations are also  significantly  affected by general economic and competitive
conditions,  particularly changes in market interest rates,  government policies
and actions of regulatory authorities.

Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning
assets and expense on interest-bearing  liabilities. Net interest income depends
upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing  liabilities and
the interest rates earned or paid on them.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding
(i) the total dollar amount of interest and dividend  income of the Company from
interest-earning  assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar
amount of interest  expense on  interest-bearing  liabilities  and the resultant
average costs; (iii) net  interest/dividend  income; (iv) interest-rate  spread;
(v) net interest margin;  and (vi) weighted average yields and rates at December
31,  1997.  Yields and costs were  derived by dividing  income or expense by the
average balance of assets or liabilities,  respectively,  for the periods shown.
The average balance of loans receivable  includes loans on which the Company has
discontinued  accruing  interest.  The yields and costs  include  fees which are
considered to constitute adjustments to yields.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES

The Savings  Bank is required to  maintain  minimum  levels of liquid  assets as
defined  by  OTS  regulations.  That  requirement,   which  varies  periodically
depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows, is based upon a percentage
of deposits and  short-term  borrowings.  The current  required ratio is 4%. The
Savings Bank  historically  has maintained a level of liquid assets in excess of
the regulatory requirement.  Liquid assets consist of cash, cash equivalents and
short-and  intermediate-term  U.S.  Government and government agency securities.
The maintenance of liquid assets allows for the possibility of disintermediation
when interest rates fluctuate. The Savings Bank's liquidity ratios were 8.7% and
13.5% at December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996, respectively.

The  Savings  Bank's  sources  of  funds  include  proceeds  from  payments  and
prepayments on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities,  proceeds from the
maturities of investment  securities,  sales of securities  and deposits.  While
maturities and scheduled  amortization  of loans and  investment  securities are
predictable  sources of funds,  deposit  inflows and  mortgage  prepayments  are
greatly  influenced by local conditions,  general interest rates, and regulatory
changes.

At December 31, 1997, the Savings Bank had outstanding  commitments to originate
$22.6  million of loans,  to fund unused lines of credit of $11.5 million and to
fund the undisbursed  portion of loans in process of $12.3 million.  The Savings
Bank  believes  that  it will  have  sufficient  funds  available  to  meet  its
commitments.  At December 31, 1997, certificates of deposit which were scheduled
to mature in one year or less totaled $168.3 million. Management believes, based
on past experience,  that a significant  portion of these funds will remain with
the Savings Bank.

REGULATORY  CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS

As a federally-chartered  financial institution, the Savings Bank is required to
maintain certain minimum amounts of regulatory  capital.  Regulatory  capital is
not a valuation  allowance and has not been created by charges against earnings.
The following table is a summary of the capital requirements, the Savings Bank's
regulatory capital and the amounts in excess at December 31, 1997:

MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
The Company's market risk arises primarily from  interest-rate  risk inherent in
its lending and deposit  taking  activities.  To that end,  management  actively
monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.  The measurement of market
risk associated  with financial  instruments is meaningful only when all related
and offsetting on- and  off-balance-sheet  transactions are aggregated,  and the
resulting  net  positions are  identified.  Disclosures  about the fair value of
financial instruments,  which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's  primary objective is managing  interest-rate  risk is to minimize
the  adverse  impact of changes  in  interest  rates on the Bank's net  interest
income and capital, while adjusting the Company's  asset-liability  structure to
obtain the maximum  yield-cost  spread on that  structure.  The  Company  relies
primarily  on its  asset-liability  structure  to  control  interest  rate risk.
However,  a sudden and  substantial  increase  in interest  rates may  adversely
impact the Company's  earnings,  to the extent that the interest  rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed,  to the same extent,  or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

ASSET /LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

The Savings  Bank's  primary  mission is to provide  home  ownership by offering
permanent and construction residential mortgage loans and consumer financing and
by  providing  conveniently  located  depository  facilities  with  transaction,
savings and certificate accounts. The Savings Bank's goal is to continue to be a
well-capitalized   and  profitable  operation  that  provides  service  that  is
professional,  efficient  and  courteous.  The Savings Bank seeks to fulfill its
mission and  accomplish  its goals by pursuing  the  following  strategies:  (i)
emphasizing lending in the one-to-four-family  residential mortgage market; (ii)
controlling interest-rate risk; (iii) managing deposit pricing and asset growth;
(iv) emphasizing cost control; and (v) maintaining asset quality by investing in
mortgage-backed  securities which, in management's  judgment,  provide a balance
between  yield  and  safety  in  a  home  mortgage  related  investment.  It  is
management's   intention  to  continue  to  employ  these  strategies  over  the
foreseeable future.

The Savings Bank's profitability,  like that of most financial institutions,  is
dependent  to a  large  extent  upon  its  net  interest  income,  which  is the
difference  between its  interest  income on  interest-earning  assets,  such as
loans,  mortgage-backed  securities and investment securities,  and its interest
expense on interest-bearing  liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings.
Financial  institutions  continue to be affected by general changes in levels of
interest rates and other economic factors beyond their control.  At December 31,
1997, the Savings  Bank's  one-year  interest  sensitivity  gap (the  difference
between the amount of  interest-earning  assets anticipated by the Savings Bank,
based on  certain  assumptions,  to mature or  reprice  within  one year and the
amount of interest-bearing liabilities anticipated by the Savings Bank, based on
certain  assumptions,  to mature or reprice  within one year) as a percentage of
total assets was a positive 9.78%. Generally, an institution with a positive gap
would  experience  an  increase  in net  interest  income  in a period of rising
interest rates.  However,  certain  shortcomings are inherent in the sensitivity
analysis  presented above. For example,  although certain assets and liabilities
may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different
manners to changes in market  interest  rates.  Therefore,  no assurance  can be
given  that the  Savings  Bank will be able to  maintain  its net  interest-rate
spread as market interest rates fluctuate.

The Savings Bank  monitors its  interest  rate risk through the  Asset/Liability
Committee  which  meets  weekly  and  reports  the  results  of such  monitoring
quarterly to the Board of  Directors.  The Savings  Bank's  policy is to seek to
maintain  a  balance  between   interest-earning   assets  and  interest-bearing
liabilities so that the Savings Bank's cumulative one-year gap ratio is within a
range  which  management  believes is  conducive  to  maintaining  profitability
without incurring undue risk. Considering the current interest rate environment,
the Savings Bank has increased its  investment  in  adjustable-rate  and shorter
average life,  fixed-rate  mortgage-related  securities and, generally,  has not
retained in its portfolio 30 year fixed-rate  loans, in order to position itself
against  the  consequences  of rising  interest  rates.  The  Savings  Bank also
maintains  liquid assets in excess of the regulatory  requirement,  allowing for
the possibility of disintermediation when interest rates fluctuate.  The Savings
Bank's liquidity ratio of 8.7% at December 31, 1997 is significantly higher than
the regulatory  requirement of 4%. In addition,  the Savings Bank's large stable
core deposit base resulting from its continuing  commitment to quality  customer
service has historically provided it with a steady source of funds.

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 TO DECEMBER 31, 1996

General Operating Results.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 1997, was
    $3.8  million or $1.01 per share,  compared to net income for the year ended
    December  31, 1996 of $2.2  million or $.54 per share.  The  increase in net
    income  was  primarily  the  result of an  increase  of $1.5  million in net
    interest income before provision for loan losses for 1997, and the effect of
    the one-time SAIF assessment during 1996 of $1.7 million before taxes.

Interest Income.  Interest income increased $3.9 million,  or 16.3%,  from $24.2
    million for the year ended  December 31, 1996 to $28.2  million for the year
    ended  December 31, 1997. The increase was due to an increase in the average
    balance of total  interest-earning  assets from $321.9  million for the year
    ended  December 31, 1996 to $361.1  million for the year ended  December 31,
    1997, an increase of $39.2 million,  or 12.2% and an increase in the average
    yield on interest-earning  assets from 7.52% for the year ended December 31,
    1996 to 7.80% for the year ended  December  31, 1997.  The average  yield on
    loans decreased from 8.33% for the year ended December 31, 1996 to 8.31% for
    the year ended  December  31,  1997.  The average  yield on  mortgage-backed
    securities  increased  from 6.25% for the year ended  December  31,  1996 to
    6.45% for the year ended  December 31, 1997. The average yield on investment
    securities  and other interest  earning assets  increased from 6.00% for the
    year ended December 31, 1996 to 6.09% for the year ended December 31, 1997.

Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $2.5 million from $13.0 million at
    December 31, 1996 to $15.4  million at December  31, 1997.  The increase was
    due to a $43.4  million or 15.8%  increase in the  average  balance of total
    interest-bearing liabilities from $274.4 million for the year ended December
    31,  1996 to $317.7  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1997 and an
    increase in the weighted-average  rate paid on interest-bearing  liabilities
    from 4.72% during 1996 to 4.85% in 1997.

Provision  for Loan  Losses.  The  Savings  Bank's  provision  for  loan  losses
    increased from $107,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996 to $649,000 for
    the year ended  December  31,  1997.  The increase of $542,000 is due to the
    growth of the  commercial  loan  portfolio  and reflects the Savings  Bank's
    continuing  policy of  evaluating  the  adequacy of its  allowance  for loan
    losses and prevailing standards within the thrift industry.  Generally, such
    evaluation  includes  consideration of the level of nonperforming  loans and
    the level and composition of the Savings Bank's loan portfolio.

Noninterest  Income.  Noninterest  income  increased  from $809,000 for the year
    ended  December  31, 1996 to $1.2  million for the year ended  December  31,
    1997. The increase was due to a gain on the sale of other assets during 1997
    of $302,000,  with no  corresponding  amount  during 1996 and an increase in
    other  service  charges and fees of $94,000 for the year ended  December 31,
    1997.
<PAGE>

Noninterest  Expense.  Noninterest  expense  consists  primarily of salaries and
    employee  benefits,   occupancy  expense  and  deposit  insurance  premiums.
    Noninterest  expense decreased $826,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997
    compared to 1996.  This  decrease was  primarily  due to the  one-time  SAIF
    recapitalization  expense of $1.7 million during 1996 and a related decrease
    in deposit  insurance  premium of $477,000 during 1997,  partially offset by
    increases  in salaries  and  employee  benefits of  $934,000  and  occupancy
    expense of $118,000.  The remaining items in noninterest  expense  increased
    $254,000  for the year ended  December  31, 1997  compared to the year ended
    December 31, 1996 primarily due to the growth of the Company.

Provision for Income  Taxes.  The  provision  for federal and state income taxes
    increased  from $1.5  million for the year ended  December  31, 1996 to $2.1
    million  for the year  ended  December  31,  1997.  The  effective  tax rate
    decreased  from 40.4% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 to 35.7% for the
    year ended December 31, 1997.

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO DECEMBER 31, 1995

General Operating Results.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 1996, was
    $2.2  million or $.54 per share,  compared  to net income for the year ended
    December  31, 1995 of $3.1  million or $.73 per share.  The  decrease in net
    income  was  primarily  the  result  of  the  effect  of the  one-time  SAIF
    assessment of $1.7 million before taxes,  included in  noninterest  expense,
    partially  offset by an increase of $949,000 in net interest  income  before
    provision for loan losses.

Interest Income.  Interest  income  increased  $1.7 million,  or 7.7% from $22.5
    million for the year ended  December 31, 1995 to $24.2  million for the year
    ended  December 31, 1996. The increase was due to an increase in the average
    balance of total  interest-earning  assets from $307.7  million for the year
    ended  December 31, 1995 to $321.9  million for the year ended  December 31,
    1996, an increase of $14.2  million,  or 4.6%,  primarily as a result of new
    branch  openings,  and an increase in the average yield on  interest-earning
    assets from 7.31% for the year ended December 31, 1995 to 7.52% for the year
    ended December 31, 1996. The average yield on loans decreased from 8.43% for
    the year ended  December  31, 1995 to 8.33% for the year ended  December 31,
    1996. The average yield on mortgage-backed  securities  increased from 6.01%
    for the year ended  December  31, 1995 to 6.25% for the year ended  December
    31, 1996.  The average yield on  investment  securities  and other  interest
    earning assets  decreased from 6.12% for the year ended December 31, 1995 to
    6.00% for the year ended December 31, 1996.

Interest  Expense.  Interest  expense  increased  $776,000 from $12.2 million at
    December 31, 1995 to $13.0  million at December  31,  1996,  as the weighted
    average  rate paid on  interest-bearing  liabilities  increased  from  4.71%
    during 1995 to 4.72% in 1996.

Provision  for Loan  Losses.  The  Savings  Bank's  provision  for  loan  losses
    decreased from $124,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995 to $107,000 for
    the year ended  December  31,  1996.  The  decrease of $17,000  reflects the
    Savings Bank's continuing policy of evaluating the adequacy of its allowance
    for loan  losses  and  prevailing  standards  within  the  thrift  industry.
    Generally,   such  evaluation   includes   consideration  of  the  level  of
    nonperforming loans and the level and composition of the Savings Bank's loan
    portfolio.

Noninterest  Income.  Noninterest  income  increased  from $709,000 for the year
    ended  December 31, 1995 to $809,000  for the year ended  December 31, 1996.
    The  increase  was due to an increase in other  service  charges and fees of
    $93,000, and deposit account fees of $12,000 for the year ended December 31,
    1996.

Noninterest  Expense.  Noninterest  expense  consists  primarily of salaries and
    employee  benefits,   occupancy  expense  and  deposit  insurance  premiums.
    Noninterest  expense  increased $2.4 million for the year ended December 31,
    1996 compared to 1995.  That increase was primarily due to the one-time SAIF
    recapitalization  expense of $1.7  million and  increases  in  salaries  and
    employee benefits of $356,000 and occupancy expense of $233,000,  due to the
    opening of two new branches.  The  remaining  items in  noninterest  expense
    increased $136,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996 compared to the year
    ended December 31, 1995 primarily due to the growth of the Company.

Provision for Income  Taxes.  The  provision  for federal and state income taxes
    decreased  from $1.9  million for the year ended  December  31, 1995 to $1.5
    million  for the year  ended  December  31,  1996.  The  effective  tax rate
    increased  from 38.4% for the year ended  December 31, 1995 to 40.4% for the
    year ended December 31, 1996.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Consolidated  Financial  Statements and Notes thereto  presented herein have
been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP,  which  requires  the  measurement  of
financial  position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering the changes in the relative  purchasing power of money over time due
to inflation.  The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the
Savings Bank's  operations.  Unlike most  industrial  companies,  nearly all the
assets and liabilities of the Savings Bank are monetary in nature.  As a result,
interest rates have a greater impact on the Savings Bank's  performance  than do
the effects of general levels of inflation.  Interest  rates do not  necessarily
move in the same  direction  or to the same  extent  as the  price of goods  and
services.

FUTURE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS

The FASB has recently  issued the following  Statements of Financial  Accounting
Standards which are relevant to the Company:

    Financial  Accounting   Standards  130  -  Reporting   Comprehensive  Income
    establishes  standards  for  reporting  comprehensive  income.  The Standard
    defines comprehensive income as the change in equity of an enterprise except
    those   resulting   from   stockholder   transactions.   All  components  of
    comprehensive  income  are  required  to  be  reported  in a  new  financial
    statement  that is displayed  with equal  prominence  as existing  financial
    statements.  The Company will be required to adopt this  Standard  effective
    January 1, 1998.  As the  Statement  addresses  reporting  and  presentation
    issues only, there will be no impact on operating  results from the adoption
    of this Standard.

    Financial  Accounting  Standards  131 -  Disclosures  about  Segments  of an
    Enterprise  and  Related  Information   establishes  standards  for  related
    disclosures  about  products  and  services,  geographic  areas,  and  major
    customers.  The Company  will be required to adopt this  Standard  effective
    January 1, 1998. As the Standard  addresses  reporting and disclosure issues
    only,  there will be no impact on operating  results  from  adoption of this
    Standard.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
    FFLCBancorp,  Inc. (the "Holding  Company") was  incorporated in Delaware on
        September 16, 1993 as a unitary  savings and loan holding  company.  The
        Holding  Company  completed  its public  offering  of  4,603,032  shares
        (adjusted  for  stock  split)  of common  stock on  January  4, 1994 and
        acquired First Federal  Savings Bank of Lake County (the "Savings Bank")
        in   connection   with   the   Savings   Bank's    conversion   from   a
        federally-chartered  mutual savings association to a federally-chartered
        stock savings bank.  The Holding  Company's  acquisition  of the Savings
        Bank was  accounted for as a  pooling-of-interest.  The Savings Bank was
        established  in 1934 as a  federally-chartered  mutual  savings and loan
        association.   The  Savings   Bank  is  a   community-oriented   savings
        institution which offers a variety of financial  services to individuals
        and  businesses  primarily  located in Lake  County  and Sumter  County,
        Florida.  The  deposits of the  Savings  Bank are insured by the Federal
        Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC") through the Savings Association
        Insurance Fund ("SAIF").

    Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated  financial statements include
        the accounts of the Holding  Company,  the Savings Bank, and the Savings
        Bank's  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Lake County Service  Corporation (the
        "Service Corporation").  All significant  intercompany  transactions and
        balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

    General. The accounting and reporting policies of FFLC Bancorp, Inc. and its
        subsidiaries  (together,  the "Company")  conform to generally  accepted
        accounting  principles  and  to  general  practices  within  the  thrift
        industry.  All per share  amounts  presented  reflect  the effect of the
        five-for-three  stock split in November,  1997. The following summarizes
        the significant accounting policies of the Company:

    Estimates.  The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with
        generally accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management to make
        estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
        liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the
        date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues
        and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual results could differ
        from those estimates.

    Cashand  Cash   Equivalents.   For  the  purpose  of   presentation  in  the
        consolidated  statements of cash flows,  cash and cash  equivalents  are
        defined as those amounts included in the balance-sheet caption "cash and
        cash equivalents."

        The  Savings  Bank is  required  to  maintain  certain  average  reserve
        balances  pursuant to  regulations of the Federal  Reserve Board.  These
        balances  must be  maintained  in the form of vault cash or  noninterest
        bearing  deposits at a Federal  Reserve Bank.  The Savings Bank exceeded
        this  requirement,  which was $843,000 and $680,000 at December 31, 1997
        and 1996, respectively.

    Trading Securities.  Securities which are held principally for resale in the
        near term are  classified  as trading and carried at their fair  values.
        Unrealized   gains  and  losses  on  trading   securities  are  included
        immediately in income.

    Securities  Held to  Maturity.  Securities  for  which the  Company  has the
        positive  intent and ability to hold to maturity  are  reported at cost,
        adjusted for  premiums and  discounts  that are  recognized  in interest
        income using the interest method over the period to maturity.

    Securities  Available  for Sale.  Available-for-sale  securities  consist of
        securities not classified as trading securities nor as  held-to-maturity
        securities.


                                       26
<PAGE>
    Securities  Available  for Sale,  Continued.  Unrealized  holding  gains and
        losses, net of tax, on  available-for-sale  securities are reported as a
        net  amount  in a  separate  component  of  stockholders'  equity  until
        realized.

        Gains  and  losses  on the  sale of  available-for-sale  securities  are
        determined using the specific identification method.

        Declines  in  the  fair  value  of   individual   held-to-maturity   and
        available-for-sale  securities  below  their  cost that are  other  than
        temporary have resulted in  write-downs of the individual  securities to
        their fair value. There were no such write-downs included in earnings as
        realized losses during the three years ended December 31, 1997.

        Premiums  and  discounts  are  recognized  in interest  income using the
        interest method over the period to maturity.

    Loans  Receivable.  Loans  receivable  that  management  has the  intent and
        ability to hold for the foreseeable  future or until maturity or pay-off
        are   reported  at  their   outstanding   principal   adjusted  for  any
        charge-offs,  the  allowance  for loan losses,  and any deferred fees or
        costs on originated loans.

        Loan  origination  fees  and  certain  direct   origination   costs  are
        capitalized  and recognized as an adjustment of the yield of the related
        loan.

        The  accrual of  interest on impaired  loans is  discontinued  when,  in
        management's  opinion,  the borrower  may be unable to meet  payments as
        they become  due.  When  interest  accrual is  discontinued,  all unpaid
        accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized
        only to the extent cash payments are received.

        The  allowance  for loan  losses is  increased  by charges to income and
        decreased by  charge-offs  (net of  recoveries).  Management's  periodic
        evaluation  of the adequacy of the  allowance is based on the  Company's
        past loan loss  experience,  known and inherent  risks in the portfolio,
        adverse  situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, the
        estimated  value of any  underlying  collateral,  and  current  economic
        conditions.

    Foreclosed Real Estate.  Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu
        of, loan  foreclosure are to be sold and are initially  recorded at fair
        value at the date of foreclosure  establishing  a new cost basis.  After
        foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the
        real  estate is  carried at the lower of  carrying  amount or fair value
        less cost to sell.  Revenue and expenses from  operations and changes in
        the valuation  allowance are included in the consolidated  statements of
        income.

    Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently
        enacted income tax rates  applicable to the period in which the deferred
        tax assets or  liabilities  are  expected to be realized or settled.  As
        changes  in tax laws or rates  are  enacted,  deferred  tax  assets  and
        liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.

    Premises and  Equipment.  Land is carried at cost.  The Company's  premises,
        furniture and equipment and leasehold  improvements are carried at cost,
        less accumulated  depreciation and amortization  computed principally by
        the straight-line method.

    Stock-Based  Compensation.  Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No.
        123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation"  establishes  a "fair
        value" based method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans and
        encourages  all entities to adopt that method of  accounting  for all of
        their  employee stock  compensation  plans.  However,  it also allows an
        entity to  continue to measure  compensation  cost for those plans using
        the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion
        No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees."  The Company has
        elected  to  follow  APB  Opinion  25  and  related  interpretations  in
        accounting for its employee stock options.



                                       27

    Off-Balance  Sheet  Instruments.  In the ordinary  course of  business,  the
        Company has entered into  off-balance-sheet  instruments  consisting  of
        commitments to extend credit and commitments under lines of credit. Such
        financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they
        are funded.

    FairValues of Financial  Instruments.  The following methods and assumptions
        were  used  by the  Company  in  estimating  fair  values  of  financial
        instruments:

        Cash and Cash  Equivalents.  The carrying amounts of cash and short-term
        instruments approximate their fair value.

        Investment and  Mortgage-Backed  Securities.  Fair values for securities
        are based on quoted  market  prices.  If quoted  market  prices  are not
        available,  fair  value is based on quoted  market  prices  for  similar
        securities.

        Loans Receivable.  For variable-rate  loans that reprice  frequently and
        have no  significant  change in credit  risk,  fair  values are based on
        carrying  values.  Fair values for  certain  fixed-rate  mortgage  (e.g.
        one-to-four family  residential),  commercial real estate and commercial
        loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses,  using interest
        rates  currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers
        of similar credit quality.

        Federal  Home Loan Bank Stock.  Fair value of the Bank's  investment  in
        FHLB stock is based on its redemption  value,  which is its cost of $100
        per share.

        Deposit  Liabilities.  The fair values disclosed for demand,  NOW, money
        market and  savings  deposits  are, by  definition,  equal to the amount
        payable  on demand  at the  reporting  date  (that  is,  their  carrying
        amounts).  Fair  values  for  fixed-rate  certificates  of  deposit  are
        estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest
        rates   currently  being  offered  on  certificates  to  a  schedule  of
        aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.

        Borrowed  Funds.  The carrying  amounts of borrowings  under  repurchase
        agreements   approximate  their  fair  values.   Fair  values  of  other
        borrowings are estimated  using  discounted  cash flow analysis based on
        the Company's current  incremental  borrowing rates for similar types of
        borrowing arrangements.

        Accrued Interest.  The carrying amounts of accrued interest  approximate
        their fair values.

        Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments. Fair values for off-balance-sheet lending
        commitments  are based on fees  currently  charged to enter into similar
        agreements,  taking into account the remaining  terms of the  agreements
        and the counterparties' credit standing.

    Net Income Per Share of Common Stock.  During 1997, the Company  adopted the
        provisions  of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 128,  "Earnings Per
        Share" (SFAS No. 128).  SFAS No. 128 provides  accounting  and reporting
        standards for calculating  earnings per share. Basic income per share of
        common  stock has been  computed by dividing the net income for the year
        by the weighted average number of shares  outstanding.  Shares of common
        stock  purchased  by the  Employee  Stock  Option Plan  ("ESOP") and the
        Retention and Recognition Plan ("RRP") incentive plans (see Note 17) are
        only considered outstanding when the shares are released or committed to
        be released for allocation to participants. The ESOP initially purchased
        368,242  shares,  of which 4,383 shares were released for  allocation to
        participants  each month  beginning  in January,  1994.  At December 31,
        1997,   162,399  shares  remain   uncommitted  and  are  not  considered
        outstanding  for purposes of the  computation of net income per share of
        common  stock.  The RRP initially  purchased  184,122  shares,  of which
        178,063,  177,517 and 179,541  were  allocated to  participants  and are
        considered   outstanding   for  December   31,  1995,   1996  and  1997,
        respectively.  The remaining  unallocated RRP shares were not considered
        outstanding  during  1995,  1996 and 1997.  Diluted  income per share is
        computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
        outstanding including the dilutive effect of stock options (see Note 17)
        computed using the treasury stock method prescribed by SFAS No. 128. The
        following  table  presents  the  calculation  of net income per share of
        common stock:

    Future Accounting  Requirements.  The FASB has recently issued the following
        Statements of Financial  Accounting  Standards which are relevant to the
        Company:

            Financial Accounting Standards 130 - Reporting  Comprehensive Income
            establishes  standards  for  reporting   comprehensive  income.  The
            Standard defines  comprehensive income as the change in equity of an
            enterprise except those resulting from stockholder transactions. All
            components of comprehensive  income are required to be reported in a
            new financial  statement that is displayed with equal  prominence as
            existing financial statements. The Company will be required to adopt
            this Standard effective January 1, 1998. As the Statement  addresses
            reporting and  presentation  issues only, there will be no impact on
            operating results from the adoption of this Standard.

            Financial  Accounting  Standards 131 - Disclosures about Segments of
            an  Enterprise  and Related  Information  establishes  standards for
            related  disclosures about products and services,  geographic areas,
            and major  customers.  The  Company  will be  required to adopt this
            Standard  effective  January  1,  1998.  As the  Standard  addresses
            reporting  and  disclosure  issues only,  there will be no impact on
            operating results from adoption of this Standard.

    Reclassifications.  Certain  amounts  in  the  1995  and  1996  consolidated
        financial   statements   have  been   reclassified  to  conform  to  the
        presentation for 1997.

(2)  Investment Securities
    Investment  securities  have been  classified  in the  consolidated  balance
        sheets  according  to  management's  intent.  The  carrying  amounts  of
        securities  and their  approximate  fair values at December  31, were as

    There were no sales of  mortgage-backed  securities  during the years  ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.

    The Company's portfolio of mortgage-backed securities include collateralized
        mortgage  obligations  (CMOs).  CMOs are generally divided into tranches
        whereby  principal  repayments  from the  underlying  mortgages are used
        sequentially  to retire the securities  according to the priority of the
        tranches. The Company invests in the following  collateralized  mortgage
        obligation tranches:  sequential,  planned amortization class,  targeted
        amortization class or support or companion  floating-rate tranches. Such
        tranches  have  stated  maturities  ranging  from 1-27  years;  however,
        because of  prepayments,  the  expected  weighted  average life of these
        securities at December 31, 1997 is approximately 2.2 years. The majority
        of the CMOs  owned by the  Company  are  insured or  guaranteed,  either
        directly or indirectly,  through  mortgage-backed  securities underlying
        the  obligations  by either the FNMA,  FHLMC or GNMA.  Depending  on the
        amount of the Company's  available-for-sale  mortgage-backed securities,
        fluctuations  in the interest rate  environment  and other factors,  the
        Company may experience  material effects on its capital resources due to
        categorizing  these securities as available for sale. The Company's CMOs
        may be subject to price movements which typically result from prepayment
        on the  underlying  obligations.  The  Company's  CMOs have coupon rates
        ranging from 4.00% to 7.53% and had a weighted  average rate of 6.14% at
        December 31, 1997. The Company purchases only CMOs rated AA or better by
        nationally recognized rating services.

    There were no impaired  loans  recognized  under SFAS 114 and 118 during the
        years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996.

    The Company  originates or purchases  nonresidential  real  property  loans.
        These loans are considered by management to be of somewhat  greater risk
        of uncollectibility due to the dependency on income production or future
        development  of the  real  estate.  Nearly  all of  the  Company's  real
        property loans were  collateralized  by real property in Lake and Sumter
        Counties, Florida.

    Nonaccrual  loans  at  December  31,  1997  and 1996  totaled  $242,000  and
        $666,000,  respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 1997, interest
        income on loans would have been  increased  approximately  $9,000 if the
        interest  on  nonaccrual  loans at December  31, 1997 had been  recorded
        under the original terms of such loans.  All of the nonaccrual  loans at
        December   31,   1997  and  1996  were   first-mortgage,   single-family
        residential   loans  or  consumer  loans.   There  have  been  no  loans
        restructured during any of the periods presented.

(7)  Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank and Other Borrowings
    As  of December 31, 1997, the Savings Bank had $30.0 million in Federal Home
        Loan Bank of Atlanta ("FHLB") advances outstanding. These advances had a
        weighted  average interest rate of 6.01% and will mature during the year
        ended  December 31, 2002.  The security  agreement  with FHLB includes a
        blanket  floating  lien  requiring  the Savings  Bank to maintain  first
        mortgage  loans as pledged  collateral  in an amount  equal to at least,
        when discounted at 75% of the unpaid principal  balances,  100% of these
        advances.  The FHLB  stock  is also  pledged  as  collateral  for  these
        advances.

    The Savings Bank had $30 million of  additional  credit  availability  via a
        FHLB line of credit. The Savings Bank did not draw funds on this line of
        credit at any time during the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996.

    The $150,000 community  investment fund advance  outstanding at December 31,
        1996 and 1995 bears  interest at 7.17% and matured  February  28,  1997.
        This advance was obtained in accordance with the Community  Reinvestment
        Act to provide lower interest rate financing to developers of low-income
        housing.

    Mortgage-backed  securities sold under dollar reverse repurchase  agreements
        were delivered to the broker-dealers who arranged the transactions.  The

        securities to other  parties in the normal  course of their  operations,
        and  have  agreed  to  resell  to the  Company  substantially  identical
        securities at the maturities of the agreements.

    Retained  earnings at  December  31,  1997 and 1996  includes  approximately
        $5,810,000  for which no deferred  federal income tax liability has been
        recognized.  This amount  represents an allocation of income to bad debt
        deductions for tax purposes only.  Reduction of amounts so allocated for
        purposes  other than tax bad debt  losses or  adjustments  arising  from
        carryback of net  operating  losses would create income for tax purposes
        only,  which would be subject to the then current  corporate  income tax
        rate. The unrecorded  deferred  income tax liability on the above amount
        was approximately $2,186,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1996.

    The Small  Business Job  Protection  Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act") enacted on
        August 2, 1996 requires savings institutions,  such as the Savings Bank,
        to recapture  certain  portions of their  accumulated bad debt reserves,
        and eliminated the Percentage of Taxable Income Method of accounting for
        bad debts for tax purposes.  The Savings Bank was required to change its
        method of accounting for bad debts for tax purposes effective January 1,
        1996.  In addition,  the Savings Bank will be required to recapture  the
        excess of its bad debt  reserves at December 31, 1995 over its base year
        reserves at December 31, 1987,  ratably over a six-year period beginning
        in 1998.  At  December  31,  1997,  the Savings  Bank had  approximately
        $910,000 of deferred tax  liabilities  recorded for the recapture of its
        excess bad debt reserves.

(9)  Pension Plan
    Prior to 1996, the Company participated in a multi-employer  defined benefit
        pension plan (the "Pension Plan") which covered substantially all of its
        employees. The Company's funding policy with respect to the Pension Plan
        was to make an annual  contribution  determined  by the  Pension  Plan's
        actuaries that would not be less than the minimum required contribution,
        nor greater than the maximum  federal income tax deductible  limit.  The
        Company's contributions for the Pension Plan for the year ended December
        31, 1995 was $65,000.  During 1996, the Company decided to withdraw from
        participation  in  the  Pension  Plan,  and  accordingly,  participants'
        benefits were frozen and participants  became fully vested at that date.
        The Company did not make a contribution to the Pension Plan for 1996.

    In  connection   with  the  above,   the  Company   adopted  a  new  defined
        contribution  profit sharing  401(k) plan (the "401(k) Plan")  effective
        April 1, 1996. All employees who have met a minimum service  requirement
        (1,000 hours of service in a twelve-month period) may participate in the
        Plan. Under the 401(k) Plan, a participant may elect to contribute up to
        15% of their annual  compensation,  subject to IRS  limitations on total
        annual contributions.  The Company will make contributions to the 401(k)
        Plan on a monthly  basis at two percent of  participants'  compensation.
        Contributions  to the 401(k) Plan for the year ended  December  31, 1997
        and 1996 were $37,000 and $23,000, respectively.

(10)  Financial Instruments
    The Company is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet risk
        in the normal  course of  business  to meet the  financing  needs of its
        customers  and to reduce its own  exposure to  fluctuations  in interest
        rates. These financial  instruments are commitments to extend credit and
        may involve,  to varying degrees,  elements of credit and  interest-rate
        risk in excess of the  amount  recognized  in the  consolidated  balance
        sheet. The contract amounts of these  instruments  reflect the extent of
        involvement the Company has in these financial instruments.
<PAGE>

    The Company's  exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
        other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit
        is  represented  by the  contractual  amount of those  instruments.  The
        Company uses the same credit  policies in making  commitments as it does
        for on-balance-sheet instruments.


                                       38

<PAGE>
    Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
        there is no  violation of any  condition  established  in the  contract.
        Commitments  generally have fixed expiration dates or other  termination
        clauses and may require  payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments
        are expected to expire  without being drawn upon,  the total  commitment
        amounts do not  necessarily  represent  future  cash  requirements.  The
        Company  evaluates each customer's  credit  worthiness on a case-by-case
        basis.  The amount of  collateral  obtained if deemed  necessary  by the
        Company  upon  extension  of  credit  is  based on  management's  credit
        evaluation of the counterparty.

    The estimated  fair values of the Company's  financial  instruments  were as

(11)  Significant Group Concentration of Credit Risk
     The Company grants real estate and consumer loans to customers primarily in
         the State of Florida  with the  majority  of such loans in the Lake and
         Sumter County area. Therefore, the Company's exposure to credit risk is
         significantly affected by changes in the economy of the Lake and Sumter
         County area.

     The contractual  amounts of credit related  financial  instruments  such as
         commitments  to  extend  credit  represent  the  amounts  of  potential
         accounting  loss should the contract be fully drawn upon,  the customer
         default and the value of any existing collateral become worthless.

</TABLE>

(13)  Commitments and Contingencies
    In  the  ordinary  course of business,  the Company has various  outstanding
        commitments  and  contingent  liabilities  that are not reflected in the
        accompanying consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company
        is a  defendant  in  certain  claims  and legal  actions  arising in the
        ordinary  course  of  business.  In the  opinion  of  management,  after
        consultation  with legal  counsel,  the  ultimate  disposition  of these
        matters  is not  expected  to  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
        consolidated financial condition of the Company.

(14)  Restrictions on Retained Earnings
    The Savings  Bank is  subject  to  certain  restrictions  on the  amount  of
        dividends  that it may declare  without prior  regulatory  approval.  At
        December 31, 1997, approximately $16.0 million of retained earnings were
        available for dividend declaration without prior regulatory approval.

(15)  Regulatory Matters
    The Savings  Bank is  subject  to  various  regulatory  capital  requirement
        administered  by the federal banking  agencies.  Failure to meet minimum
        capital  requirements  can  initiate  certain   mandatory-and   possibly
        additional  discretionary-actions  by regulators  that,  if  undertaken,
        could  have  a  direct  material  effect  on  the  Company's   financial
        statements.   Under  capital  adequacy  guidelines  and  the  regulatory
        framework  for prompt  corrective  action,  the  Savings  Bank must meet
        specific capital  guidelines that involve  quantitative  measures of the
        Savings Bank's assets, liabilities,  and certain off-balance-sheet items
        as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The Savings Bank's
        capital  amounts  and  classification  are also  subject to  qualitative
        judgements by the regulators  about  components,  risk  weightings,  and
        other factors.
<PAGE>

    Quantitative  measures  established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
        require the Savings Bank to maintain  minimum  amounts (set forth in the
        table below) of total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations)
        to  risk-weighted  assets  (as  defined).  Management  believes,  as  of
        December  31,  1997,  that the Savings  Bank meets all capital  adequacy
        requirements to which it is subject.

    As  of  December  31,  1997,  the  most  recent  notification  from  the OTS
        categorized  the Savings Bank as well  capitalized  under the regulatory
        framework  for  prompt  corrective  action.  To be  categorized  as well
        capitalized,  the Savings Bank must maintain  minimum  tangible,  tier I
        (core),  tier I (risk-based) and total risk-based  capital ratios as set
        forth in the  table.  There  are no  conditions  or  events  since  that
        notification  that  management  believes have changed the  institution's
        category.

    On  September 30, 1996,  legislation was enacted which,  among other things,
        imposed a  special  one-time  assessment  on SAIF  member  institutions,
        including  the Savings  Bank,  to  recapitalize  the SAIF and spread the
        obligations for payments of Financing  Corporation ("FICO") bonds across
        all SAIF and BIF members. The FDIC special assessment levied amounted to
        65.7 basis points on SAIF assessable deposits held as of March 31, 1995.
        The special  assessment  was recognized in the third quarter of 1996 and
        was tax  deductible.  The Savings Bank recorded a charge of $1.7 million
        before  taxes  during 1996 as a result of the FDIC  special  assessment.
        That legislation eliminated the substantial disparity between the amount
        that  BIF and  SAIF  members  had  been  paying  for  deposit  insurance
        premiums.

    Beginning on  January 1, 1997,  BIF  members  will pay a portion of the FICO
         payment equal to 1.3 basis points on BIF-insured deposits,  compared to
         6.48 basis points payable by SAIF members on SAIF-insured deposits, and
         will pay a pro rata share of the FICO payment on the earlier of January
         1, 2000 or the date upon which the last  savings  association,  such as
         the Savings Bank,  ceases to exist.  The legislation  also requires BIF
         and SAIF to be  merged by  January  1, 1999  provided  that  subsequent
         legislation is adopted to eliminate the savings association charter and
         no savings associations remain as of that time.

    The  FDIC  substantially  lowered SAIF  assessments to a range comparable to
         those of BIF members,  although  SAIF members will  continue to pay the
         higher FICO payments  described  above.  Management  cannot predict the
         level of FDIC insurance  assessments on an ongoing basis or whether the
         BIF and SAIF will eventually be merged.

(16)  Conversion to Stock Savings Bank
    The  Savings  Bank  successfully  completed  a  conversion  from a federally
         chartered  mutual savings  association to a federally  chartered  stock
         savings  bank on January  4, 1994  pursuant  to the Plan of  Conversion
         adopted by the Savings  Bank's  Board of Directors on June 17, 1993 and
         subsequently  approved  by  regulatory  authorities  and members of the
         Bank.  FFLC  Bancorp,  Inc. was created as the holding  company for the
         Savings Bank as part of this conversion,  generating  proceeds of $23.3
         million (net of shares purchased by the Savings Bank for employee stock
         incentive  plans)  from the sale of  4,603,032  shares  of stock at the
         price of $6 per share in a subscription and community offering.

    The  Plan of  Conversion  provided for the  establishment  of a  Liquidation
         Account  equal  to the  retained  income  of  the  Savings  Bank  as of
         September  30,  1993 (the date of the most recent  financial  statement
         presented in the final conversion prospectus).  The Liquidation Account
         is established to provide a limited priority claim to the assets of the
         Savings  Bank  to  qualifying  depositors  as  of  September  30,  1992
         (Eligible  Account  Holders) who  continue to maintain  deposits in the
         Savings  Bank after  conversion.  In the  unlikely  event of a complete
         liquidation of the Savings Bank, and only in such event,  each Eligible
         Account Holder would receive from the Liquidation Account a liquidation
         distribution  based on  their  proportionate  share  of the then  total
         remaining qualifying deposits.
<PAGE>

    Current  regulations  allow the Savings  Bank to pay  dividends on its stock
         after the  conversion  if its  regulatory  capital would not thereby be
         reduced  below  the  amount  then   required  for  the   aforementioned
         Liquidation Account.  Also, capital distribution  regulations limit the
         Savings  Bank's  ability to make capital  distributions  which  include
         dividends,   stock  redemptions  and  repurchases,   cash-out  mergers,
         interest  payments on certain  convertible debt and other  transactions
         charged  to the  capital  account  based on  their  capital  level  and
         supervisory condition. Federal regulations also preclude any repurchase
         of the stock by the Savings Bank or its holding company for three years
         after  conversion  except  for  purchases  of  qualifying  shares  of a
         director and repurchases  pursuant to an offer made on a pro rata basis
         to all  stockholders  and with prior  approval  of the Office of Thrift
         Supervision or pursuant to an open-market stock repurchase program that
         complies  with  certain  regulatory  criteria.  See  also  Note  19 for
         information regarding the Savings Bank's Stock Repurchase Program.

(17)  Stock Benefit Plans
    During 1996,  the Company  adopted the  provisions of Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation"
        ("SFAS No. 123"). SFAS No. 123 applies to stock-based compensation under
        the Company's  incentive stock option plan (the "Option Plan") and under
        the Company's Recognition and Retention Plan discussed below. As allowed
        by SFAS No. 123, the Company elected to continue to measure compensation
        cost for the  options  or shares  granted  under  either  plan using the
        intrinsic  value method of accounting  prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,
        "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."  SFAS No. 123 does not apply
        to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan discussed below.

    During the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,  10,867,  8,332 and
         5,035 options were granted under the Option Plan, and 2,014,  6,000 and
         4,515 shares were awarded under the  Recognition  and  Retention  Plan.
         SFAS No. 123 requires pro forma fair value disclosures if the intrinsic
         value method is being utilized. In order to calculate the fair value of
         the options,  it was assumed that the risk-free  interest rate was 7.0%
         for each period, an annualized dividend yield of approximately 2% would
         apply over the exercise period,  the expected life of the options would
         be the entire  exercise  period and the expected  stock  volatility was
         23%, 14% and 26%,  respectively,  for 1997, 1996 and 1995. For purposes
         of pro forma  disclosures,  the  estimated  fair value was  included in
         expense  in  the  period  vesting  occurs.  The  following  information
         pertains to the options  granted to  purchase  common  stock and shares
         awarded  in  1997,  1996  and  1995 (in  thousands,  except  per  share
         amounts):

    Stock Option Plan. During  1993,  the Company  adopted and the  shareholders
         approved the Option Plan.  On January 4, 1994,  upon  conversion of the
         Savings Bank to a stock  association,  stock options for 460,303 common
         shares  were  authorized  to be  granted  to  directors,  officers  and
         employees  of the Savings Bank  including  66,343  shares  reserved for
         future  directors,  officers and  employees.  Shares  granted under the
         Option Plan are  exercisable  at the market price at the date of grant.
         Such  incentive  stock  options  granted to officers and  employees are
         exercisable  in  three  equal  annual  installments,   with  the  first
         installment  becoming  exercisable  one year  from  the date of  grant.
         Options granted to outside directors are exercisable  immediately,  but
         any common shares obtained from exercise of the options may not be sold
         prior to one year from the date of  grant.  All  options  expire at the
         earlier of ten years from the date of grant or one year  following  the
         date which the outside director, officer or employee ceases to serve in
         such capacity. At December 31, 1997, 57,666 shares remain available for
         grant to future directors, officers and employees.

    Employee Stock  Ownership  Plan. The Company  sponsors a leveraged ESOP that
        covers eligible  employees who have a twelve-month  period of employment
        with the Savings  Bank during which they worked at least 1,000 hours and
        who have attained age 21. The Savings Bank makes quarterly contributions
        to the ESOP equal to the ESOP's debt service.  The ESOP Trust  purchased
        368,242 shares of common stock in the Company's  initial public offering
        with the proceeds from a loan from the Company. This loan bears interest
        at a fixed-rate of six percent with  principal  and interest  payable in
        equal quarterly installments over seven years. The ESOP shares initially
        were pledged as collateral  for its debt. As the debt is repaid,  shares
        are released from collateral and allocated to active  employees based on
        the  proportion  of debt  service  paid  during  the year.  The  Company
        accounts for its ESOP in  accordance  with  Statement of Position  93-6.
        Accordingly,  the debt of the ESOP is  recorded  as debt and the cost of
        the  shares  pledged  as  collateral  are  reported  as a contra  equity
        account.  As shares are released from  collateral,  the Company  records
        compensation expense, and an offsetting credit to capital,  equal to the
        current  market price of the shares,  and the shares become  outstanding
        for  earnings per share  computations.  Dividends on all ESOP shares are
        recorded as  compensation  expense as it is  management's  intention  to
        allocate   the   dividends   along  with  the  shares  when   allocated.
        Compensation  expense for the years ended  December 31,  1997,  1996 and
        1995 included the following ESOP related costs:

    Recognition and Retention Plan. The Company  adopted,  and the  shareholders
        approved,  an RRP for  directors,  officers and  employees to enable the
        Savings Bank to attract and retain experienced and capable personnel. On
        January 4, 1994,  the  conversion  date,  184,122 shares of common stock
        were  purchased  for the RRP which  included  8,067 shares  reserved for
        future directors,  officers and employees. The shares are granted in the
        form of restricted stock to be earned in three equal annual installments
        beginning  April 4, 1995.  The RRP shares  purchased  in the  conversion
        initially  were  excluded  from   stockholders'   equity.   The  Company
        recognized  compensation  expense in the amount of the fair market value
        of the common stock at the grant date of $6 per share, pro rata over the
        years  (1996,  1995 and 1994)  during  which the shares  were earned and
        payable  and  recorded a credit to  shareholders'  equity.  Compensation
        expense  attributable  to the RRP amounted to $368,000 in 1996, 1995 and
        1994. No compensation  expense attributable to the RRP was recognized in
        1997.  The shares  are  entitled  to all  voting  and other  shareholder
        rights,  except  that the  shares,  while  restricted,  cannot  be sold,
        pledged or otherwise disposed of, and are required to be held in escrow.

    If  a holder of restricted  stock under the RRP  terminated  employment  for
        reasons other than death, disability, retirement or change of control in
        the Company,  such employee  forfeits all rights to any allocated shares
        which  are  still  restricted.   If  termination  is  caused  by  death,
        disability,  retirement  or  change  in  control  of  the  Company,  all
        allocated  shares become  unrestricted.  Forfeitures  are reallocated to
        eligible  participants  annually.  At December  31,  1997,  4,581 shares
        remain reserved for future directors, officers and employees.

(19)  Stock Repurchase Program
    In  December  1994,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  approved  a Stock
        Repurchase  Program  ("Program") which allows the Company to acquire its
        outstanding  common stock in the open market.  The Company  subsequently
        received OTS approval for the  Program,  and began  repurchasing  shares
        early  in  1995.   Under  the  Program,   the  Company  was  limited  to
        repurchasing  no more than 5%, or  approximately  138,000  shares of its
        publicly-held  common stock over a one-year  period  ending  January 16,
        1996.  During the year ended December 31, 1995,  132,044 shares or 95.6%
        of the  maximum  number  of  shares  approved  under  the  Program  were
        repurchased.

    In  January and August  1996,  the  Company's  Board of  Directors  approved
        programs which allow the Company to acquire  additional  common stock in
        the open market.  The Company received OTS approval for the programs and
        began repurchasing shares within one month of approval.  During the year
        ended December 31, 1996,  all 132,000 shares  approved under the January
        1996 program were repurchased.  During the years ended December 31, 1996
        and 1997, all 126,000 shares approved under the August 1996 program were
        repurchased.

    In  January 1997, the Company's Board of Directors  approved a program which
        allows  the  Company  to  acquire  additional  common  stock in the open
        market. During the year ended December 31, 1997, 178,690 shares or 60.6%
        of the 294,928 shares approved under that program were repurchased.

                          Independent Auditors' Report



The Board of Directors
FFLC Bancorp, Inc.
Leesburg, Florida:

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of FFLC Bancorp,
Inc. and Subsidiary (the "Company") (the parent company of First Federal Savings
Bank of  Lake  County)  as of  December  31,  1997  and  1996  and  the  related
consolidated statements of income,  stockholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year  period ended December 31, 1997.  These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of the Company as of
December 31, 1997 and 1996 and the results of its  operations and its cash flows
for each of the  years in the  three-year  period  ended  December  31,  1997 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
