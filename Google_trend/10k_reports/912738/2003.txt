ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business

FFLC Bancorp,  Inc.,  ("FFLC" or the "Company") was  incorporated in Delaware on
September 16, 1993, and acquired First Federal  Savings Bank of Lake County (the
"Bank") in  connection  with the Bank's  conversion  to stock form on January 4,
1994. The Company is a savings and loan holding company subject to regulation by
the Office of Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS")  which mainly  transacts its business
through its  subsidiary,  the Bank. At December 31, 2002,  the Company had total
assets of $915.8 million and stockholders' equity of $71.1 million.

The Bank was  established  in 1934 as a  federally-chartered  mutual savings and
loan  association.  The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank  ("FHLB")
System and its deposit  accounts are insured to the maximum  allowable amount by
the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC").  At December 31, 2002, the
Bank had total  assets  of  $915.1  million  and  stockholders'  equity of $72.4
million.

During 2001,  First  Alliance  Title,  L.L.C.  ("First  Alliance"),  a 90% owned
subsidiary  of the  Company,  was  formed to  operate  as a title  agency.  This
subsidiary had only a minimal amount of activity during 2001. During 2002, First
Alliance received commission income for issuing title insurance on approximately
fifty loans.

During 2002, the Holding Company formed FFLC Statutory Trust I (the "Trust"),  a
wholly-owned  subsidiary,  for the sole purpose of issuing  $5,000,000  of trust
preferred securities as more fully described in the Borrowings section.

Market Area and Competition

The Bank is a  community-oriented  savings  institution  offering  a variety  of
financial  services to meet the needs of the  communities it serves.  The Bank's
deposit  gathering  and  lending  markets  are  primarily  concentrated  in  the
communities surrounding its full service offices located in Lake, Sumter, Citrus
and Marion counties in central Florida. Management believes that its offices are
located in communities  that generally can be characterized as rural service and
retirement communities with residential neighborhoods comprised predominately of
one-to-four-family   residences.  The  Bank  is  the  largest  (by  asset  size)
locally-based  financial  institution in Lake County, and serves its market area
with a wide selection of residential  mortgage loans and other retail  financial
services.  Management considers the Bank's reputation for financial strength and
customer  service as a major advantage in attracting and retaining  customers in
its market area and believes it benefits from its community  orientation as well
as its established deposit base and level of core deposits.

The Bank's  competition  for loans  comes  principally  from  commercial  banks,
savings  institutions,  and mortgage banking  companies.  The Bank's most direct
competition for savings has  historically  come from commercial  banks,  savings
institutions  and credit  unions.  The Bank  faces  additional  competition  for
savings  from  money-market  mutual  funds and other  corporate  and  government
securities  funds.  The Bank also faces increased  competition for deposits from
other financial  intermediaries such as securities brokerage firms and insurance
companies.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
The Company's market risk arises primarily from  interest-rate  risk inherent in
its lending and deposit  taking  activities.  To that end,  management  actively
monitors and manages its interest-rate risk exposure.  The measurement of market
risk associated  with financial  instruments is meaningful only when all related
and offsetting on- and  off-balance-sheet  transactions are aggregated,  and the
resulting  net  positions are  identified.  Disclosures  about the fair value of
financial instruments,  which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's  primary objective in managing  interest-rate  risk is to minimize
the  adverse  impact of changes  in  interest  rates on the Bank's net  interest
income and capital,  and to adjust the  Company's  asset-liability  structure to
obtain the maximum  yield-cost  spread on that  structure.  The  Company  relies
primarily  on its  asset-liability  management  to control  interest-rate  risk.
However,  a sudden and  substantial  increase  in interest  rates may  adversely
impact the  Company's  earnings to the extent that the  interest  rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed,  to the same extent,  or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

Lending Activities

Loan  Portfolio.  The Bank's loan portfolio  consists  primarily of conventional
first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family  residences.  At December 31,
2002, the Bank's total gross loans  outstanding  were $756.6  million,  of which
$395.1   million   or  52.2%  of  the   Bank's   total   loan   portfolio   were
one-to-four-family  residential first mortgage loans. Of the  one-to-four-family
residential  mortgage  loans  outstanding at that date,  approximately  45% were
fixed rate loans and 55% were  adjustable-rate  ("ARM") loans. At the same date,
commercial  real estate  loans and other loans on improved  real estate  totaled
$140.8  million,  or 18.6% of the  Bank's  total  loan  portfolio;  construction
(excluding construction/permanent loans) and land loans totaled $30.8 million or
4.1% of the Bank's total loan portfolio; and multi-family mortgage loans totaled
$22.8 million or 3.0% of the Bank's total loan portfolio.  Consumer,  commercial
and other  loans held by the Bank,  which  principally  consist  of home  equity
loans, deposit, consumer,  commercial and other loans, totaled $167.1 million or
22.1% of the Bank's total loan portfolio at December 31, 2002.

Purchase of Mortgage Loans. From time to time, the Bank purchases mortgage loans
originated by other lenders.  At December 31, 2002, $5.3 million,  or .7% of the
Bank's  total loan  portfolio  consisted  of  purchased  mortgage  loans or loan
participations.   Purchased   or   participated   mortgage   loans   consist  of
one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans.

Secondary  Market  Activities.  The Bank  participates  in the secondary  market
directly and through correspondent  relationships,  originating loans (primarily
30-year  fixed-rate  loans)  which  are  primarily  funded  by the Bank and then
reimbursed by the investor  correspondents.  Funding by the correspondent occurs
on some  loans.  These  loans are  closed on the  Bank's  documents  with  funds
provided by the investor  correspondent  at closing  with all credit  conditions
established by the investor  correspondent being satisfied prior to the issuance
of a loan commitment.  The Bank receives a fee for  originating,  processing and
closing the loans and reports the loans to the OTS as loans originated and sold.
In the year ended  December 31,  2002,  total loans  originated  by the Bank and
through the correspondents  amounted to $64.7 million or 34.8% of total mortgage
loans originated.

Loan  Originations,  Sales and Principal  Repayments.  The following  table sets
forth the Bank's  loan  originations,  sales and  principal  repayments  for the
periods indicated.

One-to-Four-Family  Mortgage  Lending.  The Bank's primary  residential  lending
emphasis  is  on  the   origination   of  first   mortgage   loans   secured  by
one-to-four-family  residences  within its primary lending area. Such residences
are primarily single family homes,  including  condominium and townhouses,  that
serve as the primary residence of the owner. To a lesser degree,  the Bank makes
loans on residences used as second homes or as investments. The Bank also offers
second mortgage loans which are underwritten  applying the same standards as for
first mortgage loans.

In the years ended  December 31, 2000,  2001 and 2002, the Bank's total mortgage
loan originations, including loans purchased or participated, amounted to $123.4
million,  $132.3  million  and $165.8  million,  respectively,  of which  $106.2
million,  $102.0  million  and $93.7  million,  respectively,  were  secured  by
one-to-four-family properties.

At December 31,  2002,  52.23% of total loans  consisted  of  one-to-four-family
residential  loans, of which  approximately  65% were ARM loans.  The Bank's ARM
loans may carry an initial  interest  rate which is less than the fully  indexed
rate for the loan.  The initial  discounted  rate is  determined  by the Bank in
accordance with market and competitive  factors.  The Bank offers one-,  three-,
and five-year ARM loans which adjust by a maximum of 2% per  adjustment  period,
with lifetime caps on increases of 5% to 6%, depending upon the program chosen.

The Bank's policy on one-to-four-family  residential mortgage loans generally is
to lend up to 80% of the appraised value of property securing the loan, or up to
95% if private  mortgage  insurance  is obtained on the amount of the loan which
exceeds 80%.

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending. As of December 31, 2002, $140.8
million,  or 18.61% of the Bank's total loan  portfolio  consisted of commercial
real  estate  loans  and  $22.8  million,  or 3.01%  of the  Bank's  total  loan
portfolio, consisted of multi-family mortgage loans.

The commercial real estate loans in the Bank's  portfolio  consist of fixed-rate
and ARM loans which were  originated  at  prevailing  market  rates.  The Bank's
policy  has been to  originate  commercial  or  multi-family  loans  only in its
primary market area.  Commercial and  multi-family  mortgage loans are generally
made in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property. In making such
loans,  the Bank primarily  considers the net operating  income generated by the
real estate to support the debt  service,  the  financial  resources  and income
level  and  managerial  expertise  of the  borrower,  the  marketability  of the
property and the Bank's lending experience with the borrower.

Commercial  Loans. As of December 31, 2002, $28.9 million or 3.82% of the Bank's
total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans.

Construction   and  Land  Loans.  The  Bank  originates  loans  to  finance  the
construction  of  one-to-four-family   homes  and,  to  a  much  lesser  extent,
originates loans for the acquisition and development of land (either  unimproved
land or improved  lots) on which the purchaser  can then build.  At December 31,
2002,  construction  (excluding  construction/permanent  loans)  and land  loans
totaled $30.8 million or 4.07% of the Bank's total loan portfolio.

At December 31, 2002, the Bank had loans in process  (undisbursed  loan proceeds
of construction loans) of $16.8 million which were mainly secured by residential
mortgages.  The Bank makes  residential  construction  loans to  homeowners on a
long-term basis with  amortization  beginning at the conclusion of construction,
usually  a  period  of  about  six  months.   Such  loans  are  carried  in  the
one-to-four-family  category and are not separately  classified as  construction
loans.   Residential   construction   loans  to  builders  are  carried  in  the
construction and land category.

Construction   and   land   loans   also   include    construction   loans   for
one-to-four-family  residential  property  for which the  borrower  will  obtain
permanent  financing  from  another  lender.  Such  loans  bear a fixed  rate of
interest that equals prime plus 1.0% during the  construction  period.  The Bank
obtains a commitment for the permanent  financing from the other lender prior to
originating the construction loan.

Consumer  Lending.  At December 31, 2002, $138.2 million or 18.26% of the Bank's
total loan portfolio consisted of consumer loans, including home equity loans of
$40.9 million, lines of credit of $19.0 million,  direct auto and truck loans of
$16.6 million,  indirect auto and truck loans of $22.8 million, home improvement
loans and other  secured  consumer  loans of $21.2  million,  lot loans of $16.8
million and unsecured personal loans of $.9 million.


                                       8
<PAGE>

The Bank's home equity loans are  originated on  one-to-four-family  residences,
either on a  fixed-rate  basis with terms of up to 15 years or as balloon  loans
with terms up to five years with fifteen year amortization periods.  Those loans
are  generally  limited to aggregate  outstanding  indebtedness  on the property
securing the loan or 90% of the loan to value  ratio.  The Bank also offers home
equity lines of credit,  which bear prime-based,  adjustable interest rates with
terms up to fifteen years. Such loans generally require monthly payments of 1.5%
of the balance outstanding including interest.

Consumer loans are offered primarily on a fixed-rate,  short-term basis.  Except
for second  mortgage  loans,  which are  underwritten  pursuant to the standards
applicable to one-to-four-family  residential loans, the underwriting  standards
employed  by  the  Bank  for  consumer  loans  include  a  determination  of the
applicant's  payment  history on other debts and an assessment of the borrower's
ability to make payments on the proposed loan and other indebtedness.

Loan  Approval  and  Authority.  Loan  approval  authority  for loans  exceeding
$1,600,000 is vested in the Loan  Committee  which meets weekly to consider loan
recommendations of the Loan Committee.  The Loan Committee is comprised of three
outside  directors,  the President and the Senior Lending  Officers of the Bank.
Manaagement has been delegated  authority to approve mortgage loans,  commercial
loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and secured consumer loans
up to $1,600,000.

The Bank's  policy is to require  title and hazard  insurance on all real estate
loans, except home equity loans for which a title search is conducted in lieu of
obtaining title  insurance.  Borrowers may be permitted to pay real estate taxes
and hazard insurance premiums  applicable to the secured property for a mortgage
loan. In some  instances,  borrowers  may be required to advance funds  together
with each payment of principal  and interest to a mortgage  escrow  account from
which the Bank makes  disbursements for items such as real estate taxes,  hazard
insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums.

Asset Quality

Delinquent  Loans  and  Nonperforming  Assets.  Loans  are  generally  placed on
nonaccrual  status when the  collection  of  principal or interest is 90 days or
more past due, or earlier if collection is deemed  uncertain.  The Bank provides
an  allowance  for  accrued  interest  deemed  uncollectible.  Accrued  interest
receivable is reported net of the allowance for uncollected interest.  Loans may
be  reinstated to accrual  status when all payments are brought  current and, in
the opinion of management, collection of the remaining balance can be reasonably
expected.

At December 31, 2002,  the Bank had no accruing  loans which were  contractually
past due 90 days or more as to  principal  and  interest  and no  troubled  debt
restructurings as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15.
Nonaccrual loans for which interest has been reduced totaled  approximately $2.6
million,  $1.9 million and $2.5  million at December  31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2002,  interest income that would
have been recorded under the original terms of nonaccrual  loans at December 31,
2002 and interest income actually recognized is summarized below (in thousands):

Classified  Assets.  Federal  regulations  and the  Bank's  policy  require  the
classification  of loans and other assets,  such as debt and equity  securities,
considered  to be of  lesser  quality  as  "substandard",  "doubtful"  or "loss"
assets. An asset is considered  "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by
the  current net worth and paying  capacity of the obligor or of the  collateral
pledged,  if  any.  "Substandard"  assets  include  those  characterized  by the
"distinct  possibility"  that the  institution  will sustain  "some loss" if the
deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the
weaknesses   inherent  in  those  classified   "substandard,"   with  the  added
characteristic  that the weaknesses  present make  "collection or liquidation in
full", on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, "highly
questionable and improbable."  Assets  classified as "loss" are those considered
"uncollectible"  and of such  little  value  that  their  continuance  as assets
without  the  establishment  of a specific  loss  reserve is not  warranted.  In
addition,  the Bank's policies require that assets which do not currently expose
the  insured  institution  to  sufficient  risk  to  warrant  classification  as
substandard  but possess other  weaknesses are designated  "special  mention" by
management.

If an asset is  classified,  the estimated fair value of the asset is determined
and if that  value is less  than  the then  carrying  value  of the  asset,  the
difference is  established as a specific  reserve.  If an asset is classified as
loss, the amount of the asset  classified as loss is reserved.  General reserves
or  general  valuation  allowances  represent  loss  allowances  which have been
established to recognize the inherent risk  associated  with lending  activities
but, unlike specific reserves, are not allocated to particular assets.

The  following  table sets forth  information  concerning  the number and dollar
amount of loans  and  foreclosed  assets  classified  as  "special  mention"  or
"substandard"  at the  dates  indicated.  No loans  or  foreclosed  assets  were
classified "doubtful" or "loss" at those dates.

Allowance for Loan Losses.  The Bank's  allowance for loan losses is established
and  maintained  through  a  provision  for loan  losses  based on  management's
evaluation of the risk  inherent in its loan  portfolio and the condition of the
local  economy in the Bank's  market area.  Such  evaluation,  which  includes a
review of all loans on which full  collectibility may not be reasonably assured,
considers,  among other  matters,  the  estimated  fair value of the  underlying
collateral,  economic and regulatory conditions,  and other factors that warrant
recognition  in  providing  for  an  adequate  loan  loss  allowance.   Although
management   believes   it  uses  the  best   information   available   to  make
determinations  with respect to the Bank's  allowance  for loan  losses,  future
adjustments may be necessary if economic  conditions vary substantially from the
economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations
or if other circumstances change.

Investment Activities

The  investment  policy  of the  Bank,  which  is  established  by the  Board of
Directors and  implemented by the Chief  Executive  Officer who is designated as
the Investment Officer, is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity,
to generate a favorable return on investments  without  incurring undue interest
rate and credit  risk,  and to  complement  the Bank's  lending  activities.  In
establishing  its  investment  strategies,  the Bank  considers its business and
growth plans, the economic  environment,  the types of securities to be held and
other factors.  Federally  chartered savings  institutions have the authority to
invest  in  various  types  of  assets,  including  U.S.  Treasury  obligations,
securities  of various  federal  agencies,  certain  certificates  of deposit of
insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers acceptances,  repurchase
agreements,  loans on federal funds, and, subject to certain limits,  commercial
paper and mutual funds.

The Company follows  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 115. That
statement requires  investment and  mortgage-backed  securities that the Company
has the  positive  intent and ability to hold to maturity  to be  classified  as
held-to-maturity  securities and reported at amortized cost. Securities that are
held  principally  for selling in the near term are to be  classified as trading
securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included
in earnings.  Securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or
trading  securities  are to be classified as  available-for-sale  securities and
reported at fair value,  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings
and reported in a separate  component of stockholders'  equity.  At December 31,
2002, all securities have been classified as available for sale by management.

Mortgage-Backed Securities

The Company's  mortgage-backed  securities  consist of securities  issued by the
Government  National  Mortgage  Association  ("GNMA"),  the  Federal  Home  Loan
Mortgage  Corporation  ("FHLMC") or the Federal  National  Mortgage  Association
("FNMA").  These  mortgage-backed  securities  totaled $22.3 million or 28.8% of
total securities.

The  following  table  sets forth  mortgage-backed  security  purchases,  sales,
amortization and principal repayments during the periods indicated:

Borrowings

Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interest in Junior Subordinated  Debentures.  On
September 26, 2002, the Trust sold  adjustable-rate  Trust Preferred  Securities
due  September  26, 2032 in the aggregate  principal  amount of $5,000,000  (the
"Capital  Securities")  in a pooled trust  preferred  securities  offering.  The
interest rate on the Capital Securities  adjusts  quarterly,  to a rate equal to
the then current  three-month  London  Interchange Bank Offering Rate ("LIBOR"),
plus 340 basis points. In addition,  the Holding Company  contributed capital of
$155,000 to the Trust for the  purchase of the common  securities  of the Trust.
The proceeds  from these sales were paid to the Holding  Company in exchange for
$5,155,000  of  its   adjustable-rate   Junior   Subordinated   Debentures  (the
"Debentures")  due September 26, 2032. The Debentures have the same terms as the
Capital  Securities.  The Holding Company then invested  $3,000,000 as a capital
contribution  in the Bank.  The sole  asset of the  Trust,  the  obligor  on the
Capital Securities, is the Debentures.

The Holding  Company has guaranteed  the Trust's  payment of  distributions  on,
payments on any redemptions of, and any  liquidation  distribution  with respect
to, the Capital  Securities.  Cash  distributions on both the Capital Securities
and the  Debentures  are  payable  quarterly  in arrears  on March 26,  June 26,
September  26 and  December  26 of each year.  Issuance  costs of  approximately
$169,000  associated with the Capital  Securities  have been  capitalized by the
Holding Company and are being amortized over the life of the securities.

        FFLC Statutory Trust I     $ 5,000         -         September 26, 2007
                                     =====        =====

The Capital Securities are subject to mandatory redemption (i) in whole, but not
in part,  upon repayment of the Debentures at stated  maturity or, at the option
of the Holding Company, their earlier redemption in whole upon the occurrence of
certain  changes  in the tax  treatment  or  capital  treatment  of the  Capital
Securities,  or a change in the law such that the Trust would be  considered  an
investment  company  and  (ii)  in  whole  or in part  at any  time on or  after
September 26, 2007 contemporaneously with the optional redemption by the Holding
Company of the  Debentures in whole or in part.  The  Debentures  are redeemable
prior to maturity at the option of the Holding Company (i) on or after September
26, 2007,  in whole at any time or in part from time to time,  or (ii) in whole,
but not in  part,  at any time  within  90 days  following  the  occurrence  and
continuation of certain changes in the tax treatment or capital treatment of the
Capital  Securities,  or a change in law such that the Trust would be considered
an Investment  Company,  required to be registered under the Investment  Company
Act of 1940.

The Company has  entered  into a five year  interest  rate swap  agreement  that
effectively  converted the floating  interest  rate of these Capital  Securities
into a fixed  interest rate of 6.85%,  thus reducing the impact of interest rate
changes on future interest expense for the five year period.  In accordance with
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," this interest rate swap qualifies as a cash
flow hedge. The fair value of this interest rate swap is recorded as an asset or
liability on the consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting entry recorded in
other comprehensive  income, net of the income tax effect. At December 31, 2002,
the unrealized  loss of the derivative  instrument was $120,000  ($75,000 net of
tax).

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Other Borrowings

The Bank is  authorized  to  obtain  advances  from the  Federal  Home Loan Bank
("FHLB") of Atlanta which are generally collateralized by a blanket lien against
the Bank's  mortgage  portfolio.  Such  advances may be made pursuant to several
different credit programs,  each of which has its own interest rate and range of
maturities.  The maximum  amount that the FHLB of Atlanta will advance to member
institutions,  including the Bank, for purposes other than meeting  withdrawals,
fluctuates  from time to time in  accordance  with the  policies  of the Federal
Housing  Finance Board and the FHLB of Atlanta.  At December 31, 2002,  the Bank
had $149.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding.

The Bank also borrows under retail  repurchase  agreements with customers of the
Bank.  These  agreements  are  accounted  for as  borrowings  and are secured by
securities owned by the Bank.

The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Bank's
borrowings at the dates indicated:

Subsidiary Activities

The  Bank  has  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Lake  County  Service  Corporation
("LCSC"), originally formed to develop a 100-lot subdivision. LCSC sold the last
remaining lots during 2001.  LCSC's primary activity is now investment  services
for the Bank's customers. During the second quarter of 2001, the Bank introduced
an Investment  Services  Program  through a joint venture with T.H.E.  Financial
Group,  Ltd., an independent  securities  broker-dealer firm and a member of the
National   Association  of  Securities  Dealers  and  the  Securities   Investor
Protection  Corporation.  Through this  program,  the Bank offers  mutual funds,
annuities,  discount brokerage and financial planing services to bank customers.
The services are offered through LCSC, which receives monthly fees on sales made
through this program. During 2002 and 2001, LCSC recognized fees of $295,000 and
$114,000 and expenses of $227,000  and  $123,000  (including  $37,000 of initial
start-up costs in 2001), respectively from this program.

During  2001,  First  Alliance  was  formed  to  facilitate  the  sale of  title
insurance.  This  subsidiary  recognized fees of $26,000 and expenses of $12,000
during 2002. They did not have a material amount of activity during 2001.

During 2002,  the Trust was formed  solely to issue trust  preferred  securities
(see Borrowings).

Personnel

As of February 13, 2003,  the Bank had 234 full-time  employees and 14 part-time
employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and
the Bank considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

General

As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is required by federal law to
file reports with, and otherwise  comply with, the rules and  regulations of the
OTS. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by
the OTS, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the deposit insurer.
The Bank is a member of the Federal  Home Loan Bank System and,  with respect to
deposit insurance, of the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") managed by
the FDIC.  The Bank must file reports with the OTS and the FDIC  concerning  its
activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals
prior  to  entering  into  certain   transactions   such  as  mergers  with,  or
acquisitions  of, other  savings  institutions.  The OTS and/or the FDIC conduct
periodic  examinations  to test the Bank's safety and  soundness and  compliance
with  various   regulatory   requirements.   This   regulation  and  supervision
establishes a comprehensive  framework of activities in which an institution can
engage and is intended  primarily for the  protection of the insurance  fund and
depositors.  The  regulatory  structure  also gives the  regulatory  authorities
extensive  discretion  in  connection  with their  supervisory  and  enforcement
activities  and  examination  policies,  including  policies with respect to the
classification  of assets and the  establishment  of adequate loan loss reserves
for  regulatory  purposes.  Any  change  in  such  regulatory  requirements  and
policies,  whether by the OTS, the FDIC or the  Congress,  could have a material
adverse  impact on the Company,  the Bank and their  operations.  Certain of the
regulatory  requirements  applicable to the Bank and to the Company are referred
to below or  elsewhere  herein.  The  description  of statutory  provisions  and
regulations  applicable to savings  institutions and their holding companies set
forth in this Form 10-K does not  purport to be a complete  description  of such
statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company.

Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a nondiversified  unitary savings and loan holding company within
the meaning of federal law. Under prior law, a unitary  savings and loan holding
company,  such as the Company was not  generally  restricted  as to the types of
business activities in which it may engage,  provided that the Bank continued to
be a qualified thrift lender. See "Federal Savings Institution  Regulation - QTL
Test." The  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act of 1999 provides that no company may acquire
control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the
financial  activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or
for multiple savings and loan holding companies as described below. Further, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley   Act  specifies  that  existing  savings  and  loan  holding
companies  may only  engage  in such  activities.  The  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act,
however, grandfathered the unrestricted authority for activities with respect to
unitary savings and loan holding  companies  existing prior to May 4, 1999, such
as the Company,  so long as the Bank continues to comply with the QTL Test. Upon
any non-supervisory acquisition by the Company of another savings institution or
Bank that meets the


                                       23
<PAGE>

qualified  thrift lender test and is deemed to be a savings  institution  by the
OTS, the Company  would become a multiple  savings and loan holding  company (if
the acquired  institution is held as a separate  subsidiary) and would generally
be limited to activities  permissible  for bank holding  companies under Section
4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding  Company Act,  subject to the prior  approval of the
OTS, and certain activities authorized by OTS regulation.

A savings and loan holding company is prohibited  from,  directly or indirectly,
acquiring  more than 5% of the voting stock of another  savings  institution  or
savings and loan holding company,  without prior written approval of the OTS and
from  acquiring or retaining  control of a  depository  institution  that is not
insured by the FDIC. In evaluating  applications by holding companies to acquire
savings  institutions,  the OTS considers the financial and managerial resources
and future prospects of the company and institution involved,  the effect of the
acquisition on the risk to the deposit  insurance  funds,  the  convenience  and
needs of the community and competitive factors.

The OTS may not approve any acquisition  that would result in a multiple savings
and loan  holding  company  controlling  savings  institutions  in more than one
state,  subject to two  exceptions:  (i) the approval of interstate  supervisory
acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a
savings  institution  in  another  state if the laws of the state of the  target
savings institution  specifically  permit such acquisitions.  The states vary in
the extent to which they  permit  interstate  savings and loan  holding  company
acquisitions.

Although savings and loan holding  companies are not subject to specific capital
requirements  or  specific  restrictions  on the payment of  dividends  or other
capital  distributions,  federal  regulations do prescribe such  restrictions on
subsidiary savings institutions as described below. The Bank must notify the OTS
30 days before declaring any dividend to the Company. In addition, the financial
impact of a holding  company on its  subsidiary  institution is a matter that is
evaluated  by the OTS  and the  agency  has  authority  to  order  cessation  of
activities or divestiture of subsidiaries  deemed to pose a threat to the safety
and soundness of the institution.

Federal Savings Institution Regulation

Business Activities. The activities of federal savings institutions are governed
by federal law and regulations.  These laws and regulations delineate the nature
and extent of the  activities  in which  federal  associations  may  engage.  In
particular,  many types of lending  authority  for  federal  association,  e.g.,
commercial,  non-residential real property loans and consumer loans, are limited
to a specified percentage of the institution's capital or assets.

Capital  Requirements.  The OTS capital regulations require savings institutions
to meet three minimum  capital  standards:  a 1.5% tangible  capital ratio, a 4%
leverage ratio (3% for  institutions  receiving the highest rating on the CAMELS
rating  system) and an 8%  risk-based  capital  ratio.  In addition,  the prompt
corrective action standards discussed below also establish, in effect, a minimum
2% tangible capital standard, a 4% leverage ratio (3% for institutions receiving
the highest  rating on the CAMEL  financial  institution  rating  system),  and,
together with the risk-based  capital  standard  itself,  a 4% Tier 1 risk-based
capital  standard.  The OTS  regulations  also  require  that,  in  meeting  the
tangible, leverage and risk-based capital standards, institutions must generally
deduct  investments  in and  loans to  subsidiaries  engaged  in  activities  as
principal that are not permissible for a national bank.

The  risk-based   capital  standard  for  savings   institutions   requires  the
maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital
and  supplementary  capital)  to  risk-weighted  assets  of at  least 4% and 8%,
respectively.  In determining the amount of  risk-weighted  assets,  all assets,
including  certain  off-balance  sheet assets,  are  multiplied by a risk-weight
factor of 0% to 100%,  assigned by the

                                       24

<PAGE>

OTS  capital  regulation  based on the risks  believed  inherent  in the type of
asset.  Core  (Tier  1)  capital  is  defined  as  common  stockholders'  equity
(including retained earnings),  certain noncumulative  perpetual preferred stock
and related surplus,  and minority  interests in equity accounts of consolidated
subsidiaries,  less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and
credit card relationships.

The components of supplementary  capital currently include cumulative  preferred
stock,  long-term perpetual preferred stock,  mandatory convertible  securities,
subordinated  debt and intermediate  preferred stock, the allowance for loan and
lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45%
of  unrealized  gains  on  available-for-sale  equity  securities  with  readily
determinable fair market values.  Overall,  the amount of supplementary  capital
included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital.

The  capital  regulations  also  incorporate  an interest  rate risk  component.
Savings institutions with "above normal" interest rate risk exposure are subject
to a deduction from total capital for purposes of calculating  their  risk-based
capital requirements.  For the present time, the OTS has deferred implementation
of the interest  rate risk capital  charge.  At December 31, 2002,  the Bank met
each of its capital requirements.

The following table presents the Bank's capital position at December 31, 2002.

Tangible            $ 71,139       13,719       57,420        7.78%       1.50%

Prompt  Corrective  Regulatory  Action.  The OTS is  required  to  take  certain
supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which
depends  upon the  institution's  degree of  undercapitalization.  Generally,  a
savings institution that has a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of
less than 8%, a ratio of Tier 1 (core) capital to  risk-weighted  assets of less
than 4% or a ratio of core  capital to total  assets of less than 4% (3% or less
for  institutions  with the  highest  examination  rating) is  considered  to be
"undercapitalized."  A savings  institution that has a total risk-based  capital
ratio less than 6%, a Tier 1 capital  ratio of less than 3% or a leverage  ratio
that is less than 3% is considered to be "significantly  undercapitalized" and a
savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less
than 2% is  deemed  to be  "critically  undercapitalized."  Subject  to a narrow
exception,  the OTS is  required  to appoint a receiver  or  conservator  for an
institution that is "critically  undercapitalized." The regulation also provides
that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OTS within 45 days of the
date a  savings  institution  receives  notice  that  it is  "undercapitalized,"
"significantly  undercapitalized" or "critically  undercapitalized."  Compliance
with the plan must be guaranteed  by any parent  holding  company.  In addition,
numerous  mandatory  supervisory  actions  become  immediately  applicable to an
undercapitalized   institution,   including,   but  not  limited  to,  increased
monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth,  capital  distributions and
expansion.  The OTS  could  also  take  any  one of a  number  of  discretionary
supervisory  actions,  including  the  issuance of a capital  directive  and the
replacement of senior executive officers and directors.

Insurance  of  Deposit  Accounts.  The Bank is a member  of the  SAIF.  The FDIC
maintains a risk-based  assessment system by which  institutions are assigned to
one of  three  categories  based  on  their  capitalization  and  one  of  three
subcategories based on examination ratings and other supervisory information. An
institution's  assessment  rate  depends  upon  the  categories  to  which it is
assigned.


                                       25
<PAGE>


Assessment rates for SAIF member institutions are determined semiannually by the
FDIC and currently range from zero basis points for the healthiest  institutions
to 27 basis points for the riskiest.

In addition to the assessment for deposit  insurance,  institutions are required
to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing  Corporation
("FICO") to  recapitalize  the  predecessor  to the SAIF. By law, there has been
equal  sharing of FICO  payments  between SAIF and BIF members  since January 1,
2000.

The Bank did not pay an assessment for deposit insurance in 2002,  however,  its
payments toward the FICO bonds amounted to approximately  $104,000. The FDIC has
authority to increase  insurance  assessments.  A  significant  increase in SAIF
insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses
and results of operations of the Bank.  Management cannot predict what insurance
assessment rates will be in the future.

Insurance  of deposits  may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a finding  that the
institution  has  engaged  in unsafe or  unsound  practices,  is in an unsafe or
unsound  condition to continue  operations or has violated any  applicable  law,
regulation,  rule,  order or  condition  imposed  by the  FDIC or the  OTS.  The
management  of the Bank does not know of any  practice,  condition  or violation
that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

Loans to One  Borrower.  Federal law  provides  that  savings  institutions  are
generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower  applicable to national
banks. A savings institution may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or
related  group of  borrowers  in excess  of 15% of its  unimpaired  capital  and
surplus.  An additional  amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired  capital
and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable  collateral. At December
31, 2002,  the Bank's  limit on loans to one borrower was $11.3  million and the
Bank's  largest  aggregate  outstanding  loans and  extensions  of credit to one
borrower was $9.6 million.

QTL Test.  The HOLA requires  savings  institutions  to meet a qualified  thrift
lender test. Under the test, a savings association is required to either qualify
as a "domestic building and loan association" under the Internal Revenue Code or
maintain  at  least  65% of its  "portfolio  assets"  (total  assets  less:  (i)
specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets;  (ii) intangibles,  including
goodwill;  and (iii) the value of property used to conduct  business) in certain
"qualified  thrift  investments"  (primarily  residential  mortgages and related
investments,  including certain mortgage-backed securities) in at least 9 months
out of each 12 month period.

A savings  institution that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to
certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a bank charter.
As of December 31, 2002,  the Bank  maintained  77% of its  portfolio  assets in
qualified  thrift  investments and,  therefore,  met the qualified thrift lender
test.  Recent  legislation  has  expanded the extent to which  education  loans,
credit card loans and small business loans may be considered  "qualified  thrift
investments."

Limitation on Capital Distributions. OTS regulations impose limitations upon all
capital  distributions  by a  savings  institution,  including  cash  dividends,
payments  to  repurchase  its shares and  payments  to  shareholders  of another
institution  in a cash-out  merger.  Under a new regulation  effective  April 1,
1999, an  application  to and the prior approval of the OTS is required prior to
any capital  distribution  if the  institution  does not meet the  criteria  for
"expedited  treatment" of applications under OTS regulations  (i.e.,  generally,
examination ratings in the two top categories),  the total capital distributions
for the  calendar  year  exceed  net  income  for that year  plus the  amount of
retained  net  income for the  preceding  two years,  the  institution  would be
undercapitalized  following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise
be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with OTS. If an application is
not  required,


                                       26

<PAGE>

the  institution  must  still  provide  prior  notice  to  OTS  of  the  capital
distribution if, like the Bank, it is a subsidiary of a holding company.  In the
event the Bank's  capital  fell  below its  regulatory  requirements  or the OTS
notified  it that it was in need of more than  normal  supervision,  the  Bank's
ability to make capital distributions could be restricted.  In addition, the OTS
could prohibit a proposed capital  distribution by any institution,  which would
otherwise  be  permitted  by the  regulation,  if the OTS  determines  that such
distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

Assessments.  Savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the OTS to
fund the agency's  operations.  The general  assessments,  paid on a semi-annual
basis,  are computed  upon the savings  institution's  total  assets,  including
consolidated  subsidiaries,  as reported in the Bank's latest  quarterly  thrift
financial report.  The Bank was assessed  approximately  $164,000 for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2002.

Transactions   with  Related   Parties.   The  Bank's  authority  to  engage  in
transactions  with  "affiliates"  (e.g.,  any company that  controls or is under
common control with an  institution,  including the Company and its  non-savings
institution  subsidiaries)  is limited by federal law. The  aggregate  amount of
covered  transactions  with any  individual  affiliate  is limited to 10% of the
capital and surplus of the savings institution.  The aggregate amount of covered
transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings  institution's
capital and surplus.  Certain  transactions  with  affiliates are required to be
secured by collateral  in an amount and of a type  described in federal law. The
purchase of low quality  assets from  affiliates  is generally  prohibited.  The
transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances,  that are
at least as favorable to the  institution  as those  prevailing  at the time for
comparable  transactions with  non-affiliated  companies.  In addition,  savings
institutions  are  prohibited  from lending to any affiliate  that is engaged in
activities that are not  permissible  for bank holding  companies and no savings
institution   may  purchase  the  securities  of  any  affiliate  other  than  a
subsidiary.


                                       27
<PAGE>


The recently enacted Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by the
Company to its executive  officers and directors.  However,  that Act contains a
specific exception for loans by the Bank to its executive officers and directors
in compliance with federal  banking laws. The Bank's  authority to extend credit
to executive officers,  directors and 10% shareholders ("insiders"),  as well as
entities such persons  control,  is also governed by federal law. Such loans are
required  to be  made on  terms  substantially  the  same as  those  offered  to
unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment.
Recent legislation  created an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or
compensation   program  that  is  widely  available  to  all  employees  of  the
institution and does not give preference to insiders over other  employees.  The
law limits both the individual  and aggregate  amount of loans the Bank may make
to insiders based, in part, on the Bank's capital  position and requires certain
board approval procedures to be followed.

Enforcement.  The  OTS  has  primary  enforcement  responsibility  over  savings
institutions  and has the authority to bring actions against the institution and
all institution-affiliated  parties, including stockholders,  and any attorneys,
appraisers and accountants  who knowingly or recklessly  participate in wrongful
action  likely to have an  adverse  effect  on an  insured  institution.  Formal
enforcement  action may range from the issuance of a capital  directive or cease
and desist  order to removal of officers  and/or  directors  to  institution  of
receivership,   conservatorship  or  termination  of  deposit  insurance.  Civil
penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or
even  $1  million  per day in  especially  egregious  cases.  The  FDIC  has the
authority to recommend to the Director of the OTS that enforcement  action to be
taken with respect to a particular savings  institution.  If action is not taken
by the  Director,  the FDIC has  authority  to take such  action  under  certain
circumstances.  Federal  law also  establishes  criminal  penalties  for certain
violations.

Standards for Safety and Soundness.  The federal  banking  agencies have adopted
Interagency  Guidelines  prescribing  Standards  for Safety and  Soundness.  The
guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking
agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions
before  capital  becomes  impaired.   If  the  OTS  determines  that  a  savings
institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OTS may
require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve  compliance with
the standard.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

The Bank is a member  of the  Federal  Home  Loan Bank  ("FHLB")  System,  which
consists of 12  regional  FHLBs.  The FHLB  provides a central  credit  facility
primarily for member institutions. In order to borrow from the FHLB, the Bank is
required to purchase  shares of the FHLB's  nonmarketable  equity  securities at
par. The Bank,  as a member of the FHLB,  is required to acquire and hold shares
of  capital  stock  in that  FHLB in an  amount  at  least  equal to 1.0% of the
aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential  mortgage loans and similar
obligations at the beginning of each year, or 1/20 of its advances  (borrowings)
from the  FHLB,  whichever  is  greater.  The Bank was in  compliance  with this
requirement  with an  investment  in FHLB  stock at  December  31,  2002 of $7.7
million.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, the dividend yield on FHLB stock
was 5.2%.

The FHLBs are required to provide funds for the resolution of insolvent  thrifts
in the late 1980s and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs. These
requirements  could reduce the amount of  dividends  that the FHLBs pay to their
members and could also result in the FHLBs imposing a higher rate of interest on
advances to their members. If dividends were reduced, or interest on future FHLB
advances increased, the Bank's net interest income would likely also be reduced.
Recent  legislation  has changed the structure of the FHLBs funding  obligations
for  insolvent  thrifts,   revised  the  capital  structure  of  the  FHLBs  and
implemented entirely voluntary  membership for FHLBs.  Management cannot predict
the effect that these changes may have with respect to its FHLB membership.

Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve Board regulations  require savings  institutions to maintain
non-interest  earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW
and regular checking accounts).  The regulations generally provide that reserves
be maintained against aggregate  transaction  accounts as follows:  for accounts
aggregating  $42.1 million or less (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve
Board) the reserve requirement is 3%; and for accounts  aggregating greater than
$42.1  million,  the reserve  requirement is $1.083 million plus 10% (subject to
adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board between 8% and 14%) against that portion
of total transaction accounts in excess of $42.1 million. The first $6.0 million
of otherwise  reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve
Board) are exempted  from the reserve  requirements.  At December 31, 2002,  the
Bank complied with the foregoing requirements.

Community Reinvestment Act

Under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), as implemented by Office of Thrift
Supervision regulations,  a savings association has a continuing and affirmative
obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit
needs of its entire community,  including low and moderate income neighborhoods.
The CRA does  not  establish  specific  lending  requirements  or  programs  for
financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's  discretion to develop
the types of  products  and  services  that it  believes  are best suited to its
particular  community,  consistent  with the CRA. The CRA requires the Office of
Thrift  Supervision,  in connection with its  examination of an institution,  to
assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and
to take such record  into  account in its  evaluation  of  applications  by such
institution.  The CRA requires public disclosure of an institution's CRA rating.
The latest CRA rating of the Bank received from the Office of Thrift Supervision
was "Satisfactory."

Federal and State Taxation

General.  The Company and the Bank report their income on a  consolidated  basis
using the  accrual  method of  accounting,  and are  subject to  federal  income
taxation  in the  same  manner  as  other  corporations  with  some  exceptions,
including  particularly  the Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed  below.  The
following  discussion  of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not
purport to be a  comprehensive  description  of the tax rules  applicable to the
Bank or the  Company.  The Bank was last  audited  by the IRS for the year ended
December 31, 1996.  For its 2002 taxable year,  the Bank is subject to a maximum
federal income tax rate of 35%.

Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning prior to December 31, 1995, thrift
institutions  which  qualified  under  certain   definitional  tests  and  other
conditions of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") were  permitted to
use certain  favorable  provisions to calculate  their  deductions  from taxable
income  for  annual  additions  to their bad debt  reserve.  A reserve  could be
established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans  (generally  secured
by  interests  in  real  property  improved  or to be  improved)  under  (i) the
Percentage of Taxable  Income  Method (the "PTI Method") or (ii) the  Experience
Method.  The reserve for  nonqualifying  loans was computed using the Experience
Method.

The Small  Business  Job  Protection  Act of 1996 (the  "1996  Act"),  which was
enacted on August 20, 1996,  requires  savings  institutions to recapture (i.e.,
take into income) certain portions of their  accumulated bad debt reserves.  The
1996 Act repeals the reserve  method of accounting  for bad debts  effective for
tax years beginning  after 1995.  Thrift  institutions  that would be treated as
small banks are  allowed to utilize the  Experience  Method  applicable  to such
institutions,  while thrift  institutions that are treated as large banks (those
generally  exceeding  $500  million  in  assets)  are  required  to use only the
specific charge-off method.  Thus, the PTI Method of accounting for bad debts is
no longer available for any financial institution.

A thrift institution required to change its method of computing reserves for bad
debts will treat such change as a change in method of  accounting,  initiated by
the  taxpayer,  and having  been made with the  consent of the IRS.  Any Section
481(a)  adjustment  required to be taken into income with respect to such change
generally  will be taken into income  ratably  over a  six-taxable  year period,
beginning  with the first  taxable  year  beginning  after 1995,  subject to the
residential loan requirement.

Under the residential loan requirement provision,  the recapture required by the
1996 Act is suspended for each of two successive  taxable years,  beginning with
1996, in which the Bank originates a minimum of certain  residential loans based
upon the average of the principal  amounts of such loans made by the Bank during
its six taxable years  preceding its current  taxable year.  Under the 1996 Act,
for its  current  and  future  taxable  years,  the  Bank is  permitted  to make
additions to its tax bad debt  reserves.  In  addition,  the Bank is required to
recapture  (i.e.,  take into  income)  over a six year  period the excess of the
balance of its tax bad debt reserves as of December 31, 1995 over the balance of
such  reserves as of December  31,  1987.  At December  31,  2002,  the Bank had
approximately $111,000 of deferred tax liabilities recorded for the recapture of
its bad debt reserves.

Distributions.   Under  the  1996   Act,   if  the  Bank   makes   "non-dividend
distributions"  to the Company,  such  distributions  will be considered to have
been made from the Bank's  unrecaptured  tax bad debt  reserves  (including  the
balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987) to the extent thereof, and then
from the Bank's supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent thereof,
and an amount based on the amount  distributed  (but not in excess of the amount
of  such  reserves)  will  be  included  in  the  Bank's  income.   Non-dividend
distributions  include  distributions  in  excess  of  the  Bank's  current  and
accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes,
distributions in redemption of stock,  and  distributions in partial or complete
liquidation.  Dividends paid out of the Bank's  current or accumulated  earnings
and profits will not be so included in the Bank's income.



                                       30

<PAGE>

The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount
that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount
of the distribution.  Thus, if the Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to the
Company,  approximately  one and one-half times the amount of such  distribution
(but not in excess of the amount of such reserves) would be includable in income
for federal  income tax purposes,  assuming a 35% federal  corporate  income tax
rate. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture
of any portion of its bad debt reserves.

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. The Code imposes a tax on alternative minimum
taxable income  ("AMTI") at a rate of 20%. For fiscal years  beginning  prior to
January  1,  1996,  the  excess  of the bad debt  reserve  deduction  using  the
percentage  of taxable  income  method over the  deduction  that would have been
allowable  under the  experience  method is  treated  as a  preference  item for
purposes of computing the AMTI.  Only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating
loss carryovers.  The adjustment to AMTI based on book income is an amount equal
to 75% of the amount by which a corporation's  adjusted current earnings exceeds
its AMTI  (determined  without regard to this  adjustment and prior to reduction
for net  operating  losses).  In addition,  for taxable  years  through 1995, an
environmental  tax of .12% of the  excess of AMTI (with  certain  modifications)
over $2.0 million is imposed on corporations, including the Bank, whether or not
an  Alternative  Minimum  Tax  ("AMT")  is paid.  The Bank does not expect to be
subject to the AMT.

Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters. The Company may exclude from its
income  100% of  dividends  received  from  the  Bank as a  member  of the  same
affiliated group of corporations.  The corporate dividends received deduction is
generally 70% in the case of dividends  received from unaffiliated  corporations
with which the  Company  and the Bank will not file a  consolidated  tax return,
except  that if the  Company  and the Bank own more  than 20% of the  stock of a
corporation  distributing  a  dividend,  80% of any  dividends  received  may be
deducted.

Florida  Taxation.  The Bank files Florida  franchise  tax returns.  For Florida
franchise tax purposes, savings institutions are presently taxed at a rate equal
to 5.5% of taxable income.  For this purpose,  "taxable income"  generally means
federal taxable income,  subject to certain adjustments  (including the addition
of  interest  income  on  State  and  municipal  obligations).  The  Bank is not
currently under audit with respect to its Florida franchise tax returns.

                                   OUR MISSION


Our mission is to operate First Federal  Savings Bank as a community  bank, in a
manner consistent with the high expectations of our shareholders,  customers and
employees.  We will achieve  attractive  financial results for our stockholders,
provide  quality  financial  services and products to our  customers,  and offer
rewarding  careers to our employees,  while maintaining a high level of personal
service and integrity. The Company's primary goals are to: provide an attractive
return to its shareholders,  as measured by long-term  capital  appreciation and
the  continued   payment  of  reasonable   dividends;   provide  a  competitive,
progressive and profitable array of financial  services and products in a manner
focused on  excellent  customer  service;  attract and retain  highly-motivated,
top-quality  employees;  and make a positive impact on the  communities  that we
serve.


                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of  1995  evidences  Congress'
determination  that the disclosure of  forward-looking  information is desirable
for  investors  and  encourages  such  disclosure by providing a safe harbor for
forward-looking   statements  by  corporate  management.   This  Annual  Report,
including  the  Letter  to  Stockholders  and the  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis  of   Financial   Condition   and  Results  of   Operations,   contains
forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. In order to comply
with the terms of the safe harbor,  the Company  notes that a variety of factors
could cause the Company's  actual  results and  experience to differ  materially
from the anticipated  results or other  expectations  expressed in the Company's
forward-looking  statements.  The risks and  uncertainties  that may  affect the
operations,  performance,  development,  growth  projections  and results of the
Company's  business include,  but are not limited to, the growth of the economy,
interest  rate  movements,  timely  development  by the  Company  of  technology
enhancements for its products and operating  systems,  the impact of competitive
products,  services and pricing,  customer business requirements,  Congressional
legislation  and similar  matters.  Readers of this report are  cautioned not to
place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking  statements  which  are  subject  to
influence  by the named risk factors and  unanticipated  future  events.  Actual
results, accordingly, may differ materially from management expectations.

Dear Stockholders:

I am pleased to report that 2002 was a solid year for your Company.  In spite of
an uncertain economy,  we enjoyed a successful year, both in terms of the growth
of the Bank and in operating earnings.  During 2002, we again experienced record
net income from operations, and increased quarterly cash dividends on our common
stock.  First Federal Savings Bank, the Company's  subsidiary,  set a new record
for total  assets,  ending the year with total assets in excess of $915 million.
Our success results from a team effort,  and I want to take this  opportunity to
thank all of you - our  stockholders,  our  employees,  our  customers,  and our
communities  - for your  efforts and support as we moved  through  2002 and into
2003.

The Company's  net income from  operations  increased  40%, from $6.3 million in
2001 to $8.8 million in 2002. On a diluted basis, net income per share increased
39% from  $1.73 for 2001 to $2.42 for 2002.  The  increase  in net  income  from
operations  was primarily due to the  significant  decrease in the cost of funds
that the Bank  experienced,  as a result of the  continued  reductions in market
interest rates that began in 2001.

In January 2003, your Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in the quarterly
cash dividend, to $.15 per common share, from the $.14 per common share paid for
the  prior  four  quarters.  That  increase  continues  the  practice  of annual
increases in effect since 1994,  when the quarterly  cash dividend was $.036 per
common share (adjusted for the five-for-three stock split in November, 1997). In
February,  2003, the Board approved a 3-for-2 split of our common stock,  in the
nature of a stock dividend.  Stockholders  will receive one additional  share of
common  stock for every two shares  held as of the close of business on February
28, 2003,  which is the record date of the split. The payable date for the stock
split dividend is March 14, 2003.

It is  gratifying  to note that our stock price rose over 42% during 2002,  from
$20.75 to $29.57.  Since our  initial  public  offering  in 1994,  our stock has
yielded an average  annual return,  including  dividends,  of 20.85%.  We remain
convinced  that  our  best  strategy  for  creating   long-term   value  to  our
stockholders is to focus on profitability and excellence in customer service.

Asset  growth  continues to be an  important  focal point for the  Company.  The
Company's  total assets grew 11%, from $823 million at December 31, 2001 to $916
million at December 31, 2002.  During 2002,  loans receivable grew 7%, from $686
million to $735  million.  During  2002,  the Bank's loan  originations  totaled
$323.7 million,  compared to $257.9 million in 2001. The Bank originated  $148.3
million  in  residential  loans,  $95.1  million in  commercial  loans and $80.3
million in consumer  loans in 2002.  As reflected in our  financial  statements,
those  volume  levels,  as well as the  increases  in our  cash  and  investment
securities reflect  significant  increases over our results from fiscal 2001. In
reviewing our financial statements, you will see that the Company's asset growth
was funded primarily by an increase in the Bank's deposits.  We are particularly
pleased  that,  during 2002,  the Bank's  deposits  grew 14% with a  substantial
portion  of that  growth  in  checking  and  other  non-certificate  of  deposit
accounts.

The Company's  continued  success and growth is the result of team effort by our
employees  to keep pace with the growth of our  communities  and the  increasing
competition  in the  financial  services  sector.  In order to  ensure  that our
customers  have  sufficient  physical  locations  at  which to  conduct  banking
transactions,  we have continued to expand our branch structure. During 2002, we
opened  branches at two new  locations,  relocated two branches to larger sites,
and  added  one  remote  ATM  location.  We have  plans to open  two new  branch
locations in 2003.

Our  customers  continue  to indicate a desire to conduct  banking  transactions
electronically,  and I am very  pleased  to report  that  First  Federal  Online
Banking, our Internet banking solution, has continued to enjoy support from both
our retail and commercial  customers.  We currently  have over 2,900  registered
users of our online banking service, which represents an increase over last year
of approximately 61%.

If you have not had a chance  to check  out  First  Federal  Online  Banking,  I
encourage  you to visit  our  website,  www.1stfederal.com,  and click the "Test
Drive"  button.  I believe you will be pleased at how easily and  completely you
can  check  account  balances,  transfer  funds,  pay  bills,  and  access  cash
management services (for commercial customers) on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week
basis.  While you are at our website, I also encourage you to note all the other
useful information,  including our loan and deposit products, links to our press
releases  and  financial  reports,  local  weather,  and  links  to  some  other
"local-interest" websites.

Our  customers  have also  welcomed  our  efforts  to  provide  other  financial
services.  We  have  been  pleased  with  the  positive  feedback  and  customer
acceptance of mutual funds, annuities, discount brokerage and financial planning
services. These investment, retirement and financial planning services are being
offered through a joint venture program with T.H.E.  Financial  Group,  Ltd., an
independent  securities  broker-dealer firm, and member of the NASD and SIPC. We
began  offering these services in 2001, and have been pleased with the growth in
this area of the Bank's operations.  We also continue to offer trust services to
our  customers,  provided by the Trust  Department of the First National Bank of
Mount Dora under a referral  agreement.  In  addition to these  services,  First
Alliance Title, LLC, a 90% owned subsidiary of FFLC Bancorp, Inc., was formed to
operate as a title agency, and we have begun to offer title agency services on a
limited basis, primarily for construction loans.

I also want to take this  opportunity  to renew our  commitment  to honesty  and
integrity - in light of the disturbing examples of poor corporate  governance so
widely reported in the national press over recent months,  I want you to know of
our unrelenting  commitment to the highest standards of ethics,  fair and honest
reporting,  and sound corporate  oversight on which this Company was founded and
on which we continue to operate.  We have  carefully  reviewed the  unfolding of
these stories, and the resulting laws and regulations that have been issued, and
believe we are in compliance  with all of those  guidelines.  We appreciate  the
trust that you have placed in us over the past  years,  and will strive in every
way to continue to be worthy of that trust.

Community banking very much remains a "people" business.  We are blessed to have
a number of Directors and staff members who have been  associated  with the Bank
for many years.  Also,  many new employees  have joined the Bank with  extensive
banking  experience  in our market area. It is my belief that our team is second
to none in terms of providing our customers with quality customer service.

We truly appreciate the loyalty and support of our stockholders,  our customers,
and our employees.  We remain committed to increasing the long-term value of our
Company.   That  commitment   includes  meeting  the  investment  needs  of  our
stockholders, the financial needs of our customers, the personal growth needs of
our employees and the needs of the communities in which we have the privilege to
serve.  We believe FFLC Bancorp,  Inc., is well  positioned to meet those needs,
and we look forward to the opportunities before us.

Cordially yours,




Stephen T. Kurtz
President and Chief Executive Officer

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

First Federal Savings Bank of Lake County, the subsidiary of FFLC, was organized
in 1934 as a federally chartered savings and loan association and converted to a
federally  chartered stock savings bank on January 4, 1994. The Bank's principal
business  continues to be attracting retail deposits from the general public and
investing  those  deposits,  together  with  principal  repayments  on loans and
investments  and funds  generated from  operations,  primarily in mortgage loans
secured by one-to-four-family,  owner-occupied homes, commercial loans, consumer
loans  and,  to a  lesser  extent,  construction  loans  and  other  loans,  and
multi-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, the Bank holds investments
permitted by federal laws and  regulations  including  securities  issued by the
U.S.   Government  and  agencies  thereof.   The  Bank's  revenues  are  derived
principally from interest on its loan and mortgage-backed  securities portfolios
and interest and dividends on its investment securities.

The Bank is a  community-oriented  savings  institution  offering  a variety  of
financial  services to meet the needs of the  communities it serves.  The Bank's
deposit  gathering  and  lending  markets  are  primarily  concentrated  in  the
communities surrounding its full service offices located in Lake, Sumter, Citrus
and Marion counties in central Florida. Management believes that its offices are
located in communities  that generally can be characterized as rural service and
retirement communities with residential neighborhoods comprised predominately of
one-to-four-family   residences.  The  Bank  is  the  largest  (by  asset  size)
locally-based  financial  institution in Lake County, and serves its market area
with a wide selection of residential  mortgage loans and other retail  financial
services.  Management considers the Bank's reputation for financial strength and
customer  service as a major advantage in attracting and retaining  customers in
its market area and believes it benefits from its community  orientation as well
as its established deposit base and level of core deposits.

The Company's net income from operations increased 40.5% to $8.8 million for the
year ended  December  31, 2002 from $6.3  million for the year 2001.  The Bank's
total assets  increased 11.3% to $915.8 million at December 31, 2002 from $823.2
million at December 31,  2001.  That  increase  resulted  primarily  from a 7.2%
increase in net loans to $735.3 million at December 31, 2002 from $685.9 million
at  December  31,  2001,  reflecting  increased  local loan  demand.  Securities
increased 29.9% or $17.8 million during 2002. Deposits increased 14.2% to $668.1
million at December 31, 2002 from $585.1 million at December 31, 2001.  Advances
from the Federal Home Loan Bank  decreased  $5.0 million,  to $149.0  million at
December 31, 2002 from $154.0  million at December  31,  2001.  The Company also
raised $5.0 million through the issuance of trust preferred  securities  through
its newly formed subsidiary FFLC Statutory Trust I.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our financial  condition  and results of operations  are sensitive to accounting
measurements  and  estimates  of matters  that are  inherently  uncertain.  When
applying  accounting policies in areas that are subjective in nature, we use our
best  judgment  to arrive at the  carrying  value of  certain  assets.  The most
critical  accounting  policy we applied is related to the  valuation of the loan
portfolio.

A variety of factors impact  carrying value of the loan portfolio  including the
calculation   of  the  allowance  for  loan  losses,   valuation  of  underlying
collateral,  the timing of loan  charge-offs and the amount and  amortization of
loan fees and deferred origination costs.



                                       10


<PAGE>




The allowance for loan losses is the most difficult and subjective judgment. The
allowance is  established  and maintained at a level that we believe is adequate
to cover losses  resulting  from the  inability  of  borrowers to make  required
payments on loans.  Estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing  risks
associated  with  specific  loans  and the loan  portfolio,  current  trends  in
delinquencies and charge-offs, the views of our regulators,  changes in the size
and  composition of the loan portfolio and peer  comparisons.  The analysis also
requires  consideration  of the economic  climate and  direction,  change in the
interest  rate  environment,  which  may  impact a  borrower's  ability  to pay,
legislation  impacting the banking industry and economic  conditions specific to
our service  area.  Because the  calculation  of the  allowance  for loan losses
relies on estimates  and  judgments  relating to  inherently  uncertain  events,
results may differ from our estimates.

The  allowance  for  loan  losses  is also  discussed  as part  of  "Results  of
Operations"  and  in  Note  3 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  The
significant  accounting  policies are  discussed  in Note 1 to the  consolidated
financial statements.

REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

General

The operating  results of the Bank are affected by Federal laws and  regulations
and the Bank is subject to extensive regulation,  examination and supervision by
the Office of Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS"),  as its chartering  agency,  and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), as the deposit insurer. The Bank
is a member of the  Federal  Home  Loan Bank  ("FHLB")  System  and its  deposit
accounts  are  insured  up to  applicable  limits  by the  FDIC  under  the SAIF
("Savings  Association Insurance Fund"). The Bank must file reports with the OTS
and the FDIC  concerning its  activities and financial  condition in addition to
obtaining  regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such
as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial  institutions.  The OTS and
the FDIC  conduct  periodic  examinations  to test the  Bank's  compliance  with
various regulatory requirements.  The activities of the Company and the Bank are
governed by the Home Owner's Loan Act, as amended (the "HOLA"),  and, in certain
respects,  the Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Act (the  "FDIA").  A more  complete
description of the HOLA and FDIA is included in the Form 10-K.

Capital Requirements

The OTS capital regulations  require savings  institutions to meet three capital
standards: a 1.5% tangible capital standard; a 3% leverage (core capital) ratio;
and an 8% risk-based  capital  standard.  Under the OTS final rule  implementing
FDICIA,  generally, a well-capitalized  institution is defined as one that meets
the following capital standards:  a 5% tangible capital standard;  a 6% leverage
(core capital) ratio; and a 10% risk-based  capital  standard,  and has not been
notified by its Federal banking agency that it is in a "troubled  condition." At
December 31,  2002,  the Bank met each of its capital  requirements  and met the
criteria of a "well-capitalized" institution as defined above.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit
insurance  premiums  according to the level of risk involved in an institution's
activities. An institution's risk category is based upon whether the institution
is  classified as "well  capitalized,"  "adequately  capitalized"  or "less than
adequately  capitalized" and one of three supervisory  subcategories within each
capital group.  The supervisory  subgroup to which an institution is assigned is
based on a supervisory  evaluation and information  which the FDIC determines to
be relevant to the institution's  financial  condition and the risk posed to the
deposit  insurance fund.  Effective January 1, 1997, the FDIC lowered the annual
assessment  rates  for  SAIF  members  to 0 to 27  basis  points.  The  FDIC has
authority to raise  premiums if deemed  necessary.  If such action is taken,  it
could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the institution.

Under the FDIA,  insurance  of  deposits  may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a
finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound  practices,  is in
an unsafe or unsound  condition  to  continue  operations  or has  violated  any
applicable law, regulation,  rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the
OTS.  The  management  of the Bank does not know of any  practice,  condition or
violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

CREDIT RISK

The Bank's primary business is lending on residential real estate, commercial
real estate and consumer financing, activities with the inherent risk of
generating potential loan losses the magnitude of which depend on a variety of
factors affecting borrowers which are beyond the control of the Bank. The Bank
has underwriting guidelines and credit review procedures designed to minimize
such credit losses.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company's results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest
income, which is the difference between the income earned on its
interest-earning assets, primarily its loans, mortgage-backed securities and
investment securities, and its interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of
deposits and borrowings. The operating expenses of the Company principally
consist of employee compensation, occupancy expenses and other general and
administrative expenses. The Company's results of operations are also
significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions,
particularly changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions
of regulatory authorities.

Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning
assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends
upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and
the interest rates earned or paid on them.

                                       12

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding
(i) the total dollar amount of interest and dividend  income of the Company from
interest-earning  assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar
amount of interest  expense on  interest-bearing  liabilities  and the resultant
average costs; (iii) net  interest/dividend  income; (iv) interest-rate  spread;
(v) net interest margin;  and (vi) weighted average yields and rates at December
31,  2002.  Yields and costs were  derived by dividing  income or expense by the
average balance of assets or liabilities,  respectively,  for the periods shown.
The  average   balance  of  loans  includes  loans  on  which  the  Company  has
discontinued  accruing  interest.  The yields and costs  include  fees which are
considered to constitute adjustments to yields.

The following  table discloses the extent to which changes in interest rates and
changes  in  the  volume  of   interest-earning   assets  and   interest-bearing
liabilities  have affected the Company's  interest  income and interest  expense
during the periods  indicated.  Information  is provided in each  category  with
respect to (i)  changes  attributable  to changes in volume  (changes  in volume
multiplied by prior rate), (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes
in rate multiplied by prior volume) and (iii) changes attributable to changes in
rate/volume (changes in rate multiplied by changes in volume).

CAPITAL  RESOURCES

The Bank's  sources of funds include  proceeds from payments and  prepayments on
mortgage loans and mortgage-backed  securities,  proceeds from the maturities of
investment securities and deposits.  While maturities and scheduled amortization
of loans and investment  securities are  predictable  sources of funds,  deposit
inflows and mortgage  prepayments  are greatly  influenced by local  conditions,
general interest rates, and regulatory changes.

At December 31, 2002, the Bank had  outstanding  commitments to originate  $25.8
million of loans,  to fund unused lines of credit of $51.8 million,  to fund the
undisbursed  portion of loans in process of $16.8  million  and $1.5  million in
outstanding  standby  letters of  credit.  The Bank  believes  that it will have
sufficient  funds  available  to meet its  commitments.  At December  31,  2002,
certificates  of  deposit  which  were  scheduled  to mature in one year or less
totaled $251.6 million.  Management believes,  based on past experience,  that a
significant portion of those funds will remain with the Bank.

REGULATORY  CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS

As a federally-chartered financial institution, the Bank is required to maintain
certain  minimum  amounts of  regulatory  capital.  Regulatory  capital is not a
valuation  allowance and has not been created by charges against  earnings.  The
following  table  provides a summary  of the  capital  requirements,  the Bank's
regulatory capital and the amounts in excess at December 31, 2002:

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
The Company's market risk arises primarily from  interest-rate  risk inherent in
its  lending and deposit  taking  activities.  The Company has little or no risk
related to trading accounts, commodities or foreign exchange.

Management  actively  monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.  The
primary objective in managing interest-rate risk is to limit, within established
guidelines, the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the Company's net
interest  income and capital,  while  adjusting  the  Company's  asset-liability
structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure.  Management
relies primarily on its asset-liability structure to control interest rate risk.
However,  a sudden and  substantial  increase in interest rates could  adversely
impact the Company's  earnings,  to the extent that the interest  rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed,  to the same extent,  or
on the same basis.

Disclosure about the fair value of financial instruments,  which reflect changes
in  market  prices  and  rates,  can be  found  in  Note 9 of the  notes  to the
consolidated financial statements.


The Bank's  primary  mission is to provide  financing by offering  permanent and
construction  residential  mortgage  loans,  commercial  real  estate  loans and
consumer and commercial loans and by providing  conveniently  located depository
facilities with transaction,  savings and certificate accounts.  The Bank's goal
is to continue to be a well-capitalized  and profitable  operation that provides
service that is professional, efficient and courteous. The Bank seeks to fulfill
its mission and accomplish its goals by pursuing the following  strategies:  (i)
emphasizing lending in the one-to-four-family  residential






                                     15

<PAGE>

mortgage,  commercial real estate and consumer lending markets; (ii) controlling
interest-rate  risk;  (iii)  managing  deposit  pricing and asset  growth;  (iv)
emphasizing cost control; and (v) maintaining asset quality by investing in U.S.
government and agency  securities  which,  in management's  judgment,  provide a
balance between yield and safety.  It is  management's  intention to continue to
employ these strategies over the foreseeable future.

The Bank's profitability, like that of most financial institutions, is dependent
to a large extent upon its net interest income,  which is the difference between
its interest income on interest-earning  assets, such as loans,  mortgage-backed
securities   and   investment   securities,   and  its   interest   expense   on
interest-bearing liabilities,  such as deposits and other borrowings.  Financial
institutions  continue to be  affected by general  changes in levels of interest
rates and other economic factors beyond their control. At December 31, 2002, the
Bank's one-year interest  sensitivity gap (the difference  between the amount of
interest-earning  assets anticipated by the Bank to mature or reprice within one
year and the amount of interest-bearing  liabilities  anticipated by the Bank to
mature  or  reprice  within  one year) as a  percentage  of total  assets  was a
positive 13.04%.  Generally, an institution with a positive gap would experience
an increase in net  interest  income in a period of rising  interest  rates or a
decrease  in net  interest  income  in a period  of  declining  interest  rates.
However, certain shortcomings are inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented
above.  For example,  although  certain assets and  liabilities may have similar
maturities  or  periods to  repricing,  they may react in  different  manners to
changes in market interest rates.  Therefore, no assurance can be given that the
Bank will be able to maintain its net  interest-rate  spread as market  interest
rates fluctuate.

The Bank monitors its interest-rate risk through the  Asset/Liability  Committee
which meets monthly and reports the results of such monitoring  quarterly to the
Board of Directors.  The Bank's policy is to seek to maintain a balance  between
interest-earning  assets  and  interest-bearing  liabilities  so that the Bank's
cumulative  one-year gap is within a range established by the Board of Directors
and which management believes is conducive to maintaining  profitability without
incurring  undue risk. The Bank has increased its investment in  adjustable-rate
and  shorter  average  life,  mortgage-related  securities  in order to position
itself  against  the  consequences  of  rising  interest  rates.  The Bank  also
maintains  liquid  assets in an  amount  which  allows  for the  possibility  of
disintermediation when interest rates fluctuate.  The Bank's liquidity ratio was
21.1% at December 31, 2002. In addition,  the Bank's large, stable, core deposit
base resulting from its continuing  commitment to quality  customer  service has
historically provided it with a steady source of funds.

     COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2002 TO THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER
     31, 2001


     General Operating Results.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 2002
         was $8.8 million, or $2.47 per basic share and $2.42 per diluted share,
         compared  to $6.3  million,  or $1.77  per  basic  share  and $1.73 per
         diluted share,  for the year ended December 31, 2001. That increase was
         primarily  due to an increase in net interest  income of $5.9  million,
         partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in noninterest expense.

     Interest Income. Interest income increased $48,000 to $56.5 million for the
         year ended  December 31,  2002.  The  increase  resulted  from a $106.6
         million  or  14.5%   increase   in  average   interest-earning   assets
         outstanding  for the year ended  December  31,  2002  compared to 2001,
         offset by a decrease in the average  yield  earned on  interest-earning
         assets from 7.71% for the year ended December 31, 2001 to 6.73% for the
         year ended December 31, 2002.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense  decreased $5.8 million or 16.5%,  from
         $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $29.5 million for
         the year ended  December 31, 2002.  The decrease was due primarily to a
         decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities from 5.15%
         for the year  ended  December  31,  2001 to 3.72% for  2002,  partially
         offset by  increases  of $77.6  million  and $29.3  million  in average
         interest-bearing  deposits and  borrowings  outstanding,  respectively.
         Average   interest-bearing   deposits  increased  from  $537.6  million
         outstanding  during the year ended  December 31, 2001 to $615.2 million
         outstanding  during  2002.  Average  borrowings  increased  from $147.9
         million  outstanding  during the year ended December 31, 2001 to $177.2
         million in 2002.

     Provision for Loan  Losses.  The  provision  for loan  losses is charged to
         income to increase  the  allowance  for loan losses to the level deemed
         appropriate by  management.  The provision is based upon the volume and
         type  of  lending  conducted  by the  Company,  charge-off  experience,
         industry standards, the amount of nonperforming loans, general economic
         conditions,  particularly as they relate to the Company's  market area,
         and other factors related to the  collectibility  of the Company's loan
         portfolio.  The  Company  recorded  provisions  for loan losses for the
         years  ended  December  31,  2002  and  2001 of $1.8  million  and $1.1
         million,  respectively.  Net  loans  charged  off for the  years  ended
         December 31, 2002 and 2001 were  $953,000 and  $378,000,  respectively.
         Management believes that the allowance for loan losses,  which was $5.2
         million or .68% of gross loans at December 31, 2002 is adequate.

     Noninterest Income.  Noninterest  income  increased $1.0 million,  or 36.2%
         from $2.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 2001 to $3.8 million
         for 2002.  That  increase was primarily due to increases of $321,000 in
         other  service  charges  and fees and  $360,000 in net gain on sales of
         loans held for sale.  The  increase  in gain on sales of loans held for
         sale was due to an increase in the amount of residential mortgage loans
         originated to be sold in the secondary market.

     Noninterest  Expense.  Noninterest  expense  increased  by $2.0  million or
         15.8%, from $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $14.9
         million  for the  year  ended  December  31,  2002.  The  increase  was
         primarily  due to increases  in salaries and employee  benefits of $1.3
         million and occupancy expense of $404,000 related to the overall growth
         of the Company.

     Income Tax  Provision.  The income tax  provision  was $5.3 million for the
         year ended December 31, 2002 (an effective tax rate of 37.4%)  compared
         to $3.7  million  (an  effective  tax rate of 37.0%) for the year ended
         December 31, 2001.

     COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2001 TO THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER
     31, 2000


     General Operating Results.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001
         was $6.3  million,  or $1.77 and $1.73  per  basic and  diluted  share,
         respectively,  compared to $5.3  million,  or $1.50 and $1.46 per basic
         and diluted  share,  respectively,  for the year 2000. The increase was
         primarily  due to an  increase  in  interest  income  of $7.4  million,
         partially  offset by increases in interest  expense of $5.3 million and
         noninterest expense of $1.4 million.

     Interest Income.  Interest  income  increased  $7.4 million or 15.0%,  from
         $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $56.5 million for
         2001.  The  increase was due to a $114.1  million or 18.4%  increase in
         average interest-earning assets outstanding for the year ended December
         31, 2001 compared to the 2000 period, partially offset by a decrease in
         the average yield earned on interest-earning  assets from 7.94% for the
         year ended  December 31, 2000 to 7.71% for the year ended  December 31,
         2001.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense  increased $5.3 million or 17.5%,  from
         $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $35.3 million for
         the year ended  December 31, 2001.  The increase was due to an increase
         of $116.0  million in  average  interest-bearing  liabilities.  Average
         interest-bearing  liabilities increased from $569.5 million outstanding
         during the year ended December 31, 2000 to $685.5  million  outstanding
         during  the  comparable  period  for  2001.  The  average  rate paid on
         interest-bearing  liabilities  decreased  from 5.28% for the year ended
         December 31, 2000 to 5.15% for the comparable 2001 period.

     Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $869,000, or 45.6% for the
         year ended  December 31, 2001  compared to the year ended  December 31,
         2000 primarily due to an increase of $685,000 in other service  charges
         and fees during the 2001 period.

     Noninterest  Expense.  Noninterest  expense  increased  by $1.4  million or
         12.5%, from $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $12.8
         million  for the  year  ended  December  31,  2001.  The  increase  was
         primarily  due to  increases  in  salaries  and  employee  benefits  of
         $873,000,  occupancy expense of $127,000 and data processing expense of
         $90,000, all of which related to the overall growth of the Company.

     Provision for Income  Taxes.  The  provision  for federal and state  income
         taxes  increased from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000
         (an effective tax rate of 38.8%) to $3.7 million (an effective tax rate
         of 37.0%) for the corresponding period for 2001.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Consolidated  Financial  Statements and Notes thereto  presented herein have
been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP,  which  requires  the  measurement  of
financial  position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering the changes in the relative  purchasing power of money over time due
to inflation.  The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the
Bank's operations.  Unlike most industrial companies,  nearly all the assets and
liabilities of the Bank are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have
a greater impact on the Bank's performance than do the effects of general levels
of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to
the same extent as the price of goods and services.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

            December 31, 2002, 2001 and For Each of the Years in the
                    Three-Year Period Ended December 31, 2002


(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     FFLCBancorp,  Inc. (the "Holding  Company") was incorporated in Delaware on
         September 16, 1993,  and acquired  First  Federal  Savings Bank of Lake
         County (the "Bank") in connection  with the Bank's  conversion to stock
         form on January  4, 1994.  The  Holding  Company is a savings  and loan
         holding   company  subject  to  regulation  by  the  Office  of  Thrift
         Supervision  ("OTS") which mainly  transacts  its business  through its
         subsidiary,   the  Bank.  The  Bank  is  a  community-oriented  savings
         institution,  chartered  in 1934,  which  offers a variety of financial
         services  to  individuals  and  businesses  primarily  located  in Lake
         County,  Sumter County,  Citrus County and Marion County,  Florida. The
         Bank's   deposits  are  insured  by  the  Federal   Deposit   Insurance
         Corporation  ("FDIC")  through the Savings  Association  Insurance Fund
         ("SAIF").

         During 2001, First Alliance Title, LLC ("First Alliance"),  a 90% owned
         subsidiary  of the  Holding  Company  was  formed to operate as a title
         agency. In addition,  during 2002, FFLC Statutory Trust I (the "Trust")
         was  formed  for the  sole  purpose  of  issuing  $5,000,000  of  trust
         preferred securities as more fully described in Note 7.

     Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include
         the  accounts of the Holding  Company and its three  subsidiaries,  the
         Bank,  First  Alliance  and  FFLC  Trust  and the  Bank's  wholly-owned
         subsidiary, Lake County Service Corporation (the "Service Corporation")
         (all   together,   the   "Company").   All   significant   intercompany
         transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

     General. The  accounting and reporting  policies of the Company  conform to
         accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the  United  States  of
         America  and to general  practices  within the  banking  industry.  The
         following  summarizes  the  significant   accounting  policies  of  the
         Company:

     Use of  Estimates.   In  preparing  consolidated  financial  statements  in
         conformity with accounting  principles generally accepted in the United
         States  of  America,  management  is  required  to make  estimates  and
         assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
         as of the date of the balance  sheet and  reported  amounts of revenues
         and expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual results could differ
         from  those  estimates.   Material   estimates  that  are  particularly
         susceptible  to  significant  change  in the near  term  relate  to the
         determination of the allowance for loan losses and foreclosed assets.

     Cashand Cash  Equivalents.  For purposes of the consolidated  statements of
         cash flows,  cash and cash  equivalents  include  cash and balances due
         from banks and interest-bearing deposits.

     The Bank is required to maintain certain cash reserve balances  pursuant to
         regulations  of the  Federal  Reserve  Board.  These  balances  must be
         maintained in the form of vault cash or noninterest bearing deposits at
         other  banks.  The reserve  balances at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were
         approximately $8.7 million and $5.7 million, respectively.

     Securities. The Company may classify its securities as either trading, held
         to  maturity  or  available  for  sale.  Trading  securities  are  held
         principally  for resale and recorded at their fair  values.  Unrealized
         gains and losses on trading  securities  are  included  immediately  in
         earnings.  Held-to-maturity  securities are those which the Company has
         the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at
         amortized cost. Available-for-sale securities consist of securities not
         classified as trading  securities nor as  held-to-maturity  securities.
         Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, on  available-for-sale
         securities are excluded from income and reported in other comprehensive
         income. Gains and losses on the sale of  available-for-sale  securities
         are   recorded   on  the   trade   date  and   determined   using   the
         specific-identification  method.  Premiums and  discounts on securities
         available for sale are recognized in interest income using the interest
         method over the period to maturity.



                                       28

     Loans Held For Sale.  Loans originated and held for sale by the Company are
         carried  at the  lower  of  cost  or  fair  value  using  the  specific
         identification  method.  At December 31, 2002 and 2001,  the  aggregate
         fair value of loans held for sale  exceeded the carrying  value.  Gains
         and losses on the sales of such loans are recognized using the specific
         identification  method. The Company held $14.4 million and $7.1 million
         of loans held for sale at  December  31,  2002 and 2001,  respectively,
         which are included in loans on the  accompanying  consolidated  balance
         sheets.

     Loans. Loans that management has the intent and the Company has the ability
         to hold for the  foreseeable  future or until  maturity  or pay-off are
         reported at their outstanding  principal  adjusted for any charge-offs,
         the  allowance  for  loan  losses,  and any  deferred  fees or costs on
         originated loans.

         Loan  origination  fees  and  certain  direct   origination  costs  are
         capitalized and recognized as an adjustment of the yield of the related
         loan.

         The accrual of interest on loans is  discontinued  at the time the loan
         is ninety days delinquent unless the loan is well collateralized and in
         process of collection.  In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or
         charged-off  at an earlier date if  collection of principal or interest
         is considered doubtful.

         All  interest  accrued but not  collected  for loans that are placed on
         nonaccrual or  charged-off is reversed  against  interest  income.  The
         interest  on  these  loans  is  accounted  for  on  the  cash-basis  or
         cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are
         returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest  amounts
         contractually   due  are  brought   current  and  future  payments  are
         reasonably assured.

     Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses is established as
         losses are  estimated  to have  occurred  through a provision  for loan
         losses  charged to  earnings.  Loan  losses  are  charged  against  the
         allowance  when  management  believes  the  uncollectibility  of a loan
         balance is confirmed.  Subsequent  recoveries,  if any, are credited to
         the allowance.

         The  allowance  for loan  losses is  evaluated  on a  regular  basis by
         management  and is  based  upon  management's  periodic  review  of the
         collectibility  of the  loans in light of  historical  experience,  the
         nature and volume of the loan  portfolio,  adverse  situations that may
         affect  the  borrower's  ability  to  repay,  estimated  value  of  any
         underlying   collateral  and  prevailing  economic   conditions.   This
         evaluation is inherently  subjective as it requires  estimates that are
         susceptible  to  significant   revision  as  more  information  becomes
         available.

         A loan is considered  impaired when,  based on current  information and
         events,  it is probable  that the Company will be unable to collect the
         scheduled  payments of principal or interest  when due according to the
         contractual  terms  of  the  loan  agreement.   Factors  considered  by
         management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral
         value,  and the  probability  of  collecting  scheduled  principal  and
         interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment
         delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.
         Management  determines the  significance  of payment delays and payment
         shortfalls on a case-by-case  basis,  taking into  consideration all of
         the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower,  including the
         length of the delay,  the reasons for the delay,  the borrower's  prior
         payment  record,  and the amount of the  shortfall  in  relation to the
         principal and interest  owed.  Impairment is measured on a loan by loan
         basis for  commercial  loans by either the  present  value of  expected
         future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the
         loan's  obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if
         the loan is collateral dependent.

         Large  groups of smaller  balance  homogeneous  loans are  collectively
         evaluated for impairment.  Accordingly, the Company does not separately
         identify  individual  consumer  and  residential  loans for  impairment
         disclosures.



                                       29

     Foreclosed Assets. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure
         are held for sale and are initially recorded at the lower of fair value
         or the loan balance at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost
         basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed
         by  management  and the  assets are  carried  at the lower of  carrying
         amount or fair value less cost to sell.

     Premises and Equipment.  Land is carried at cost.  The Company's  premises,
         furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements are carried at cost,
         less accumulated  depreciation and  amortization  computed  principally
         using the straight-line method.

    Transfer of Financial Assets. Transfers of financial assets are accounted
        for as sales, when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control
        over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets
        have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the
        right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of
        that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the
        Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets
        through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.

     Income Taxes.  Deferred  income tax assets and  liabilities are recorded to
         reflect the tax  consequences on future years of temporary  differences
         between  revenues and expenses  reported for  financial  statement  and
         those  reported  for  income  tax  purposes.  Deferred  tax  assets and
         liabilities  are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply
         to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
         expected to be realized or settled.  Valuation  allowances are provided
         against assets which are not likely to be realized.

     Stock  Compensation  Plans.  Statement  of Financial  Accounting  Standards
         (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,  as amended by
         SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation  Transition and
         Disclosure,  (collectively,  "SFAS No. 123") encourages all entities to
         adopt a fair  value  based  method of  accounting  for  employee  stock
         compensation plans,  whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant
         date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service
         period, which is usually the vesting period. However, it also allows an
         entity to continue to measure  compensation  cost for those plans using
         the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting
         Principles  Board  Opinion  No. 25 (APB No. 25),  Accounting  for Stock
         Issued to Employees,  whereby  compensation cost is the excess, if any,
         of the  quoted  market  price of the stock at the grant  date (or other
         measurement  date) over the amount an employee  must pay to acquire the
         stock.  Stock options issued under the Company's stock option plan have
         no  intrinsic  value  at the  grant  date,  and  under  APB  No.  25 no
         compensation  cost is recognized  for them.  The Company has elected to
         continue  with  the  accounting  methodology  in APB No.  25 and,  as a
         result, has provided proforma  disclosures of net income and income per
         share and  other  disclosures,  as if the fair  value  based  method of
         accounting had been applied. (See Note 17).

     Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company has one derivative instrument
         which is used to hedge its  interest  rate  exposure by  modifying  the
         characteristics   of  the  related  balance  sheet   instrument.   This
         derivative  instrument  qualifies  as  a  cash  flow  hedge  under  the
         provisions  of  Statement  of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 133
         "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities" ("SFAS
         133").  Changes  in the  fair  value  of a  derivative  that is  highly
         effective,  and that is designated  and qualifies as a cash flow hedge,
         are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax.

     Off-Balance  Sheet  Instruments.  In the ordinary  course of business,  the
         Company has entered into  off-balance-sheet  instruments  consisting of
         commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit, undisbursed loans
         in process and standby  letters of credit.  Such financial  instruments
         are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded.

     Fair Values  of  Financial  Instruments.  The  fair  value of  a  financial
         instrument  is the  current  amount  that  would be  exchanged  between
         willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation. Fair value is best
         determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances,
         there are no quoted market prices for the Company's  various  financial
         instruments.  In cases where quoted  market  prices are not  available,
         fair  values  are  based  on  estimates  using  present  value or other
         valuation  techniques.  Those techniques are significantly  affected by
         the  assumptions  used,  including  the discount  rate and estimates of
         future cash flows.  Accordingly,  the fair value  estimates  may not be
         realized  in an  immediate  settlement  of the  instrument  or may  not
         necessarily  represent the  underlying  fair value of the instrument to
         the Company.  The following  methods and  assumptions  were used by the
         Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments:

         Cash  and  Cash  Equivalents.  The  carrying  amounts  of cash and cash
         equivalents approximate their fair value.

         Securities.  Fair values for securities available for sale are based on
         quoted market prices, where available.  If quoted market prices are not
         available,  fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable
         instruments.

         Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. Fair value of the Company's investment in
         Federal Home Loan Bank stock is based on its redemption value, which is
         its cost of $100 per share.

         Loans.  For  variable-rate  loans that reprice  frequently  and have no
         significant  change in credit  risk,  fair values are based on carrying
         values. Fair values for fixed-rate loans are estimated using discounted
         cash flow analyses,  using interest rates  currently  being offered for
         loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.

         Deposit  Liabilities.  The fair values disclosed for demand, NOW, money
         market and savings  deposits  are, by  definition,  equal to the amount
         payable  on demand at the  reporting  date  (that  is,  their  carrying
         amounts).  Fair  values for  fixed-rate  certificates  of  deposit  are
         estimated  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  calculation  that  applies
         interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of
         aggregated expected monthly maturities of certificates of deposit.

         Borrowed Funds.  The carrying  amounts of borrowings  under  repurchase
         agreements  approximate their fair values.  Fair values of Federal Home
         Loan Bank  advances and  guaranteed  preferred  beneficial  interest in
         junior subordinated debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow
         analysis based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates for
         similar types of borrowing arrangements.

         Derivative  Instruments.  Fair  value  for  the  derivative  instrument
         (interest-rate swap) is based on current settlement value.

         Accrued Interest.  The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate
         their fair values.

         Off-Balance-Sheet   Instruments.   Fair  values  for  off-balance-sheet
         lending  commitments are based on fees currently  charged to enter into
         similar  agreements,  taking into  account the  remaining  terms of the
         agreements and the counterparties' credit standing.

     Income Per Share of Common  Stock.  The Company  follows the  provisions of
         Financial  Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" (SFAS No.
         128).  SFAS No. 128 provides  accounting  and  reporting  standards for
         calculating  income per share.  Basic  income per share of common stock
         has  been  computed  by  dividing  the net  income  for the year by the
         weighted-average  number of shares outstanding.  Shares of common stock
         purchased by the Employee  Stock Option Plan ("ESOP") and the Retention
         and  Recognition  Plan  ("RRP")  (see  Note  17)  are  only  considered
         outstanding  when the shares are  released or  committed to be released
         for allocation to participants.  The ESOP initially  purchased  368,242
         shares,   of  which  4,383  shares  were  released  for  allocation  to
         participants each month beginning in January,  1994. As of December 31,
         2000, all ESOP shares had been allocated.  The RRP initially  purchased
         184,122 shares, of which 181,387 were allocated to participants and are
         considered  outstanding  for each of the years ended December 31, 2000,
         2001 and 2002. As of December 31, 2002, 2,735 shares remain uncommitted
         under the RRP plan and are not considered  outstanding  for purposes of
         the computation of net income per share of common stock. Diluted income
         per share is computed by  dividing  net income by the  weighted-average
         number of shares  outstanding  including  the dilutive  effect of stock
         options (see Note 17) computed  using the treasury  stock  method.  The
         following  table  presents the  calculation  of net income per share of
         common stock:

     Comprehensive  Income.   Accounting   principles   generally  require  that
         recognized  revenue,  expenses,  gains and  losses be  included  in net
         income.  Although  certain changes in assets and  liabilities,  such as
         unrealized  gains and  losses  on  available-for-sale  securities,  are
         reported as a separate  component of the equity  section of the balance
         sheet,   such  items,   along  with  net  income,   are  components  of
         comprehensive income. The components of other comprehensive income were
         unrealized  holding gains and losses on  securities  available for sale
         and an unrealized loss on a derivative instrument.

     Recent   Pronouncements.   In   November   2002,   the  FASB   issued  FASB
         Interpretation   No.  45,   "Guarantor's   Accounting   and  Disclosure
         Requirements   for  Guarantees,   Including   Indirect   Guarantees  of
         Indebtedness  to Others" ("FIN 45"),  which expands  previously  issued
         accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees.
         FIN 45 requires the Company to recognize an initial  liability  for the
         fair  value of an  obligation  assumed  by  issuing  a  guarantee.  The
         provision for initial recognition and measurement of the liability will
         be applied on a  prospective  basis to  guarantees  issued or  modified
         after  December  31,  2002.  The  adoption of FIN 45 is not expected to
         materially affect the consolidated financial statements.

     Reclassifications.  Certain  amounts  in the  2000  and  2001  consolidated
         financial   statements  have  been   reclassified  to  conform  to  the
         presentation for 2002.

During  the  second  quarter  of 2001,  an  impaired  loan in the amount of $1.3
million was repaid.

     The Company  originates or purchases  nonresidential  real property  loans.
         These loans are considered by management to be of somewhat greater risk
         of  uncollectibility  due to the  dependency  on income  production  or
         future development of the real estate. Nearly all of the Company's real
         property loans were  collateralized  by real property in Lake,  Sumter,
         Citrus and Marion Counties, Florida.

     Nonaccrual  loans at December  31, 2002 and 2001  totaled  $2.6 million and
         $1.9 million, respectively. There were no loans past due ninety days or
         more and still accruing  interest  income at December 31, 2002 or 2001.
         For the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000,  interest income
         on loans would have been increased approximately $106,000, $116,000 and
         $230,000,  respectively,  if the interest on nonaccrual  loans had been
         recorded under the original terms of such loans.

     Loans serviced for others,  consisting solely of  participations  sold, are
         not  included in the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The
         unpaid  principal  balances  of these  loans  were  approximately  $1.5
         million at both December 31, 2002 and 2001.

     (A) Adjustable Rate
     (B) The FHLB has the option to convert to an adjustable rate in future
         years, at which time the Company has the option to prepay the advance
         without penalty.

     The security agreement with FHLB includes a blanket floating lien requiring
         the Bank to maintain first  mortgage loans as pledged  collateral in an
         amount  equal  to at  least,  when  discounted  at 75%  of  the  unpaid
         principal  balances,  100% of these  advances.  The FHLB  stock is also
         pledged as collateral  for these  advances.  At December 31, 2002,  the
         Bank  could  borrow  up to  $247.3  million  under  the  FHLB  security
         agreement.

     The Bank  has  an $8  million  line  of  credit  facility  with  one of its
         correspondent  banks  under  which  the Bank may draw  funds  for daily
         liquidity.  Borrowings  under this line of credit must be repaid within
         seven days. The line of credit bears a floating  interest rate equal to
         the  average  federal  funds rate and expires on June 30,  2003.  As of
         December 31, 2002, the Bank has not used this line of credit.

     Other borrowed  funds were composed of retail  repurchase  agreements  with
         customers.  The Company enters into retail  repurchase  agreements with
         customers in which the funds  received are  accounted for as borrowings
         to the Company.  The total amount outstanding under these agreements at
         December  31,  2002 and 2001 were $ 14.3  million  and  $13.3  million,
         respectively.  The Company pledged  securities with a carrying value of
         $18.7 million as collateral  for these  agreements at both December 31,
         2002 and 2001.

         Securities due September 26, 2032 in the aggregate  principal amount of
         $5,000,000  (the  "Capital  Securities")  in a pooled  trust  preferred
         securities  offering.  The  interest  rate  on the  Capital  Securities
         adjusts  quarterly,  to a rate  equal to the then  current  three-month
         London Interchange Bank Offering Rate ("LIBOR"), plus 340 basis points.
         In addition, the Holding Company contributed capital of $155,000 to the
         Trust for the  purchase  of the common  securities  of the  Trust.  The
         proceeds from these sales were paid to the Holding  Company in exchange
         for $5,155,000 of its adjustable-rate  Junior  Subordinated  Debentures
         (the "Debentures") due September 26, 2032. The Debentures have the same
         terms as the Capital  Securities.  The Holding  Company  then  invested
         $3,000,000 as a capital contribution in the Bank. The sole asset of the
         Trust, the obligor on the Capital Securities, is the Debentures.

     The Holding Company has guaranteed the Trust's payment of distributions on,
         payments on any redemptions of, and any liquidation  distribution  with
         respect  to, the Capital  Securities.  Cash  distributions  on both the
         Capital  Securities and the Debentures are payable quarterly in arrears
         on March 26, June 26,  September  26 and  December 26 of each year.  At
         December 31, 2002,  approximately  $4,000 of distributions were accrued
         and are  included  in accrued  expenses  and other  liabilities  in the
         consolidated  balance sheet.  Issuance costs of approximately  $169,000
         associated  with the Capital  Securities  have been  capitalized by the
         Holding   Company  and  are  being  amortized  over  the  life  of  the
         securities.

     The Capital  Securities  are subject to mandatory  redemption (i) in whole,
         but not in part,  upon repayment of the  Debentures at stated  maturity
         or, at the option of the Holding Company,  their earlier  redemption in
         whole upon the  occurrence  of certain  changes in the tax treatment or
         capital  treatment  of the Capital  Securities,  or a change in the law
         such that the Trust would be considered an investment  company and (ii)
         in  whole  or in  part at any  time  on or  after  September  26,  2007
         contemporaneously  with the optional  redemption by the Holding Company
         of the  Debentures in whole or in part.  The  Debentures are redeemable
         prior to maturity at the option of the Holding  Company (i) on or after
         September  26, 2007, in whole at any time or in part from time to time,
         or (ii) in whole, but not in part, at any time within 90 days following
         the occurrence and continuation of certain changes in the tax treatment
         or capital treatment of the Capital Securities, or a change in law such
         that the Trust would be considered an Investment  Company,  required to
         be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

     The Company has entered into a five year interest rate swap  agreement that
         effectively  converted  the  floating  interest  rate of these  Capital
         Securities  into a fixed  interest  rate of 6.85%,  thus  reducing  the
         impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense for the five
         year period.  In  accordance  with SFAS 133,  this  interest  rate swap
         qualifies as a cash flow hedge.  The fair value of this  interest  rate
         swap is recorded as an asset or liability on the  consolidated  balance
         sheet with an offsetting entry recorded in other comprehensive  income,
         net of the income tax effect. At December 31, 2002, the unrealized loss
         on the derivative instrument was $120,000 ($75,000 net of tax).

     Retained earnings at December 31, 2002 and 2001 includes approximately $5.8
         million for which no deferred  federal  income tax  liability  has been
         recognized.  This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt
         deductions for tax purposes only. Reduction of amounts so allocated for
         purposes  other than tax bad debt losses or  adjustments  arising  from
         carryback of net operating  losses would create income for tax purposes
         only,  which would be subject to the then current  corporate income tax
         rate. The unrecorded  deferred income tax liability on the above amount
         was approximately $2.2 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

     The Small  Business Job  Protection Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act") enacted on
         August 2, 1996  requires  savings  institutions,  such as the Bank,  to
         recapture certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves,  and
         eliminated  the  Percentage of Taxable  Income Method of accounting for
         bad debts for tax purposes.  The Bank was required to change its method
         of accounting for bad debts for tax purposes effective January 1, 1996.
         In addition,  the Bank was required to recapture  the excess of its bad
         debt  reserves  at  December  31,  1995 over its base year  reserves at
         December 31, 1987, ratably over a six-year period beginning in 1998. At
         December 31, 2002, the Bank had approximately  $111,000 of deferred tax
         liabilities recorded for the recapture of its excess bad debt reserves.

(9)  Financial Instruments
     The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk
         in the normal  course of  business to meet the  financing  needs of its
         customers  and to reduce its own exposure to  fluctuations  in interest
         rates.  These  financial  instruments are commitments to extend credit,
         unused  lines of  credit,  undisbursed  loans in  process  and  standby
         letters of credit and may  involve,  to varying  degrees,  elements  of
         credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
         consolidated  balance sheet. The contract amounts of these  instruments
         reflect the extent of  involvement  the Company has in these  financial
         instruments.

     The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
         other  party to the  financial  instrument  for  commitments  to extend
         credit is represented by the contractual  amount of those  instruments.
         The Company uses the same credit  policies in making  commitments as it
         does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

     Commitments to extend  credit are  agreements to lend to a customer as long
         as there is no violation of any condition  established in the contract.
         Commitments  generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
         clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments
         are expected to expire without being drawn upon,  the total  commitment
         amounts do not  necessarily  represent  future cash  requirements.  The
         Company  evaluates each customer's  credit worthiness on a case-by-case
         basis.  The amount of  collateral  obtained if deemed  necessary by the
         Company  upon  extension  of  credit  is based on  management's  credit
         evaluation of the counterparty.

     Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company
         to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit
         risk involved in issuing  letters of credit is essentially  the same as
         that involved in extending loans to customers.

(10) Significant Group Concentration of Credit Risk
     The Company grants real estate,  commercial and consumer loans to customers
         primarily  in the State of Florida  with the  majority of such loans in
         the Lake,  Sumter,  Citrus  and  Marion  County  area.  Therefore,  the
         Company's exposure to credit risk is significantly  affected by changes
         in the economy of the Lake, Sumter,  Citrus and Marion County areas. In
         addition, the Company has a concentration of single-family  residential
         mortgage  loans  in a  specific  residential  retirement  community  of
         approximately $80.8 million at December 31, 2002.

     The contractual  amounts of credit related  financial  instruments  such as
         commitments  to  extend  credit  represent  the  amounts  of  potential
         accounting  loss should the contract be fully drawn upon,  the customer
         default and the value of any existing collateral become worthless.

(12) Commitments and Contingencies
     In  the ordinary  course of business,  the Company has various  outstanding
         commitments  and contingent  liabilities  that are not reflected in the
         accompanying   consolidated  financial  statements.  In  addition,  the
         Company is a defendant in certain  claims and legal actions  arising in
         the ordinary  course of business.  In the opinion of management,  after
         consultation  with legal  counsel,  the ultimate  disposition  of these
         matters  is not  expected  to have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
         consolidated financial condition of the Company.

(13) Restrictions on Retained Earnings
     The Bank is subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that
         it may declare without prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2002,
         approximately  $26.1 million of retained  earnings  were  available for
         dividend declaration without prior regulatory approval.

(14) Regulatory Matters
     The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered
         by the  federal  banking  agencies.  Failure  to meet  minimum  capital
         requirements  can initiate  certain  mandatory and possibly  additional
         discretionary  actions by regulators that, if undertaken,  could have a
         direct  material  effect  on  the  Company's   consolidated   financial
         statements.  Under  capital  adequacy  guidelines  and  the  regulatory
         framework  for prompt  corrective  action,  the Bank must meet specific
         capital  guidelines  that involve  quantitative  measures of the Bank's
         assets, liabilities,  and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated
         under regulatory accounting  practices.  The Bank's capital amounts and
         classification  are  also  subject  to  qualitative  judgements  by the
         regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

     Quantitative measures  established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
         require the Bank to maintain  minimum  amounts  (set forth in the table
         below) of total and Tier I capital (as defined in the  regulations)  to
         risk-weighted assets (as defined).  Management believes, as of December
         31,  2002,  that the Bank meets all capital  adequacy  requirements  to
         which it is subject.

     As  of  December  31,  2002,  the  most  recent  notification  from the OTS
         categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework
         for prompt  corrective  action.  To be categorized as well capitalized,
         the  Bank  must  maintain  minimum  tangible,  tier  I  (core),  tier I
         (risk-based)  and total  risk-based  capital ratios as set forth in the
         table.  There are no conditions or events since that  notification that
         management believes have changed the institution's category.

(15) Conversion to Stock Savings Bank
     The Bank  successfully  completed a conversion  from a federally  chartered
         mutual savings  association to a federally chartered stock savings bank
         on  January 4, 1994  pursuant  to the Plan of  Conversion.  The Plan of
         Conversion  provided for the  establishment  of a  Liquidation  Account
         equal to the retained  income of the Bank as of September 30, 1993 (the
         date of the most  recent  financial  statement  presented  in the final
         conversion  prospectus).  The  Liquidation  Account is  established  to
         provide  a  limited  priority  claim  to  the  assets  of the  Bank  to
         qualifying  depositors  as of  September  30,  1992  (Eligible  Account
         Holders)  who   continue  to  maintain   deposits  in  the  Bank  after
         conversion.  In the  unlikely  event of a complete  liquidation  of the
         Bank,  and only in such  event,  each  Eligible  Account  Holder  would
         receive from the Liquidation  Account a liquidation  distribution based
         on their  proportionate  share of the then total  remaining  qualifying
         deposits.

     Current regulations  allow the Bank to pay dividends on its stock after the
         conversion if its regulatory capital would not thereby be reduced below
         the amount then required for the  aforementioned  Liquidation  Account.
         Also, capital distribution regulations limit the Bank's ability to make
         capital  distributions  which include dividends,  stock redemptions and
         repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible
         debt and other  transactions  charged to the capital  account  based on
         their capital level and supervisory condition.

(16)  401(k) Plan
     Effective  January 1, 2001,  the Board of  Directors  approved the transfer
         from the multi-employer  401(k) plan the Company had participated in to
         a  single   employer  401(k)  plan  ("KSOP"),   and  the   simultaneous
         combination  of that  plan  with  the  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan
         discussed in Note 17. Under the new KSOP,  participation is open to all
         employees   the  month  after  hire  date  (for  purposes  of  employer
         contributions,  one year of service is required), and participants have
         the twelve  investment  options  offered by the previous  plan,  plus a
         Company stock fund. The Company makes a contribution  of at least 3% of
         compensation (for all participants who have met the one-year of service
         requirement),  which vests immediately.  In addition,  the Company will
         make a discretionary  matching  contribution  (for all participants who
         have met the  one-year of service  requirement),  which will vest after
         five years of service. For 2002 and 2001, the Board approved a matching
         contribution  equal  to  100%  of  employees'  deferrals  up  to  3% of
         compensation.   The  Company  also  makes   quarterly   profit  sharing
         contributions  (more fully discussed in Note 17) in connection with the
         KSOP. Total  contribution  expense  recognized by the Company under the
         KSOP during the years ended  December  31, 2002 and 2001 were  $642,000
         and  $513,000,  respectively.  The  amounts of  employee  and  employer
         contributions  under the KSOP,  401(k) and the ESOP are  subject to IRS
         limitations.

     Prior to January 1, 2001,  the  Company had a defined  contribution  profit
         sharing  401(k)  plan (the  "401(k)  Plan").  All  employees  who met a
         minimum service  requirement  (1,000 hours of service in a twelve-month
         period)  participated in the Plan. Under the 401(k) Plan, a participant
         could  elect  to  contribute  up to 15% of their  annual  compensation,
         subject to IRS limitations on total annual  contributions.  The Company
         made contributions to the 401(k) Plan on a monthly basis at two percent
         of participants' compensation. Contributions to the 401(k) Plan for the
         year ended December 31, 2000 were $65,700.

(17)  Stock Benefit Plans

     The Company  follows the  provisions  of Statement of Financial  Accounting
         Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No.
         123").  SFAS No. 123  applies  to  stock-based  compensation  under the
         Company's incentive stock option plan (the "Option Plan") and under the
         Company's Recognition and Retention Plan discussed below. As allowed by
         SFAS No. 123, the Company  elected to continue to measure  compensation
         cost for the  options or shares  granted  under  either  plan using the
         intrinsic value method of accounting  prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,
         "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS No. 123 does not apply
         to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan discussed below.

     Stock Option Plan. During 2002, the Company adopted a new stock option plan
         (the "2002 Plan") which  authorizes  the Company to issue up to 250,000
         shares in connection  with options  granted to  directors,  officers or
         employees  of the  Company.  The  terms  and  vesting  periods  will be
         determined  as each option is granted,  but the option price can not be
         less than the then  current  market  value of the  common  stock at the
         grant date. No options have been granted under the 2002 Plan.

         The Company also has a 1993 stock option plan (the "Plan")  under which
         460,303  common shares are  authorized to be issued in connection  with
         options  granted to  directors,  officers and employees of the Company.
         Options  granted under the Plan are  exercisable at the market price of
         the common stock at the date of grant.  Such  incentive  stock  options
         granted to officers and employees are exercisable in three equal annual
         installments,  with the first installment becoming exercisable one year
         from the date of  grant.  Options  granted  to  outside  directors  are
         exercisable  immediately,  but any common shares obtained from exercise
         of the  options  may not be sold  prior  to one  year  from the date of
         grant.  All options expire at the earlier of ten years for officers and
         employees or twenty years for  directors  from the date of grant or one
         year following the date which the outside director, officer or employee
         ceases to serve in such capacity.  At December 31, 2002,  33,713 shares
         remain available under the Plan for grant to future directors, officers
         and employees.

     The following is a summary of option transactions:

     The weighted-average  remaining  contractual life of the outstanding  stock
         options at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was 8.3, 7.7 and 7.9 years,
         respectively.  All outstanding stock options are currently  exercisable
         at December 31, 2002.






     During the year ended  December 31, 2000,  5,035 options were  granted.  No
         options were granted  under the Plan during 2002 or 2001.  SFAS No. 123
         requires pro forma fair value disclosures if the intrinsic value method
         is being utilized.  In order to calculate the fair value of the options
         granted in 2000,  it was assumed that the  risk-free  interest rate was
         7.0%, an annualized  dividend yield of  approximately  2.0% would apply
         over the exercise period, the expected life of the options would be the
         entire exercise  period and the expected stock  volatility was 37%. For
         purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value is included
         in expense in the period vesting occurs.  The proforma  information has
         been  determined  as if the Company had accounted for its stock options
         and share  awards  under the fair  value  method of SFAS No.  123.  The
         Company accounts for their stock option plans under the recognition and
         measurement   principles  of  APB  No.  25.  No  stock-based   employee
         compensation  cost is  reflected  in net income,  as all stock  options
         granted under the Plan had an exercise  price equal to the market value
         of the  underlying  common  stock on the date of grant.  The  following
         table illustrates the effect on net income and basic and diluted income
         per share as if the  Company  had  applied  the fair value  recognition
         provisions of SFAS No. 123 to  stock-based  employee  compensation  (in
         thousands, except per share amounts):

     Employee Stock  Ownership  Plan.  Through  December 31,  2000,  the Company
         sponsored  a  leveraged  ESOP  that  covered  eligible   employees  who
         completed a year of service.  The Bank made quarterly  contributions to
         the ESOP equal to the ESOP's  debt  service.  The ESOP Trust  purchased
         368,242 shares of common stock in the Company's initial public offering
         with the  proceeds  from a loan from the Company  which was paid-off in
         December 2000. The ESOP shares initially were pledged as collateral for
         its debt. As the debt was repaid,  shares were released from collateral
         and  allocated  to active  employees  based on the  proportion  of debt
         service  paid during the year.  The Company  accounted  for its ESOP in
         accordance  with Statement of Position 93-6.  Accordingly,  the debt of
         the ESOP was  recorded  as debt and the cost of the  shares  pledged as
         collateral  were  reported as a contra equity  account.  As shares were
         released from collateral,  the Company recorded  compensation  expense,
         and an offsetting credit to capital,  equal to the current market price
         of the shares,  and the shares became  outstanding for income per share
         computations.   Dividends   on  all  ESOP  shares   were   recorded  as
         compensation  expense as it was management's  intention to allocate the
         dividends  along with the shares when allocated.  Compensation  expense
         for the year ended  December  31,  2000  included  the  following  ESOP
         related costs:

     Effective January 1, 2001, the Board of Directors approved the combining of
         the ESOP with the Company's  401(k) Plan to form a new Plan,  the KSOP.
         (See Note 16). In connection  therewith,  the Company  makes  quarterly
         profit-sharing  contributions  in amounts  approved  by the Board,  and
         those  contributions  are  allocated to the  accounts of  participating
         employees on a quarterly basis.  Company  contributions  under the KSOP
         vest after five years of service. For 2002 and 2001, the Board approved
         profit-sharing  contributions  equal to four percent (4%) of the Bank's
         operating  net income,  which were made after each quarter based on the
         actual  results  of the  preceding  quarter.  During  the  years  ended
         December  31,  2002  and  2001,   the  Company   made  profit   sharing
         contributions  totaling  $312,000 and  $231,000,  respectively,  to the
         KSOP.  The Plan allows the Company to fund such KSOP  contributions  by
         either issuing  shares,  or purchasing the required number of shares on
         the open market.  As these shares are  allocated on a quarterly  basis,
         the Company  records  compensation  expense,  and either an  offsetting
         credit to capital  (in the event that new shares are issued) or to cash
         (in the event that shares are purchased on the open  market),  equal to
         the current market price of the shares.  The shares become  outstanding
         for income per share computations when allocated.

     Recognition and Retention Plan. The Company  adopted,  and the shareholders
         approved,  an RRP for  directors,  officers and employees to enable the
         Bank to attract  and  retain  experienced  and  capable  personnel.  On
         January 4, 1994,  the conversion  date,  184,122 shares of common stock
         were  purchased for the RRP which  included  8,067 shares  reserved for
         future  directors,  officers and employees.  The shares were granted in
         the  form of  restricted  stock to be  earned  in  three  equal  annual
         installments  beginning April 4, 1995. The RRP shares  purchased in the
         conversion  initially  were excluded  from  stockholders'  equity.  The
         Company  recognized  compensation  expense  in the  amount  of the fair
         market value of the common stock at the grant date of $6 per share, pro
         rata over the years (1996,  1995 and 1994) during which the shares were
         earned and payable and recorded a credit to stockholders' equity.

     If  a holder of restricted  stock under the RRP  terminated  employment for
         reasons other than death,  disability,  retirement or change of control
         in the Company,  such  employee  forfeited  all rights to any allocated
         shares which are still  restricted.  If termination is caused by death,
         disability,  retirement  or  change  in  control  of the  Company,  all
         allocated  shares become  unrestricted.  Forfeitures are reallocated to
         eligible  participants  annually.  At December 31,  2002,  2,735 shares
         remain reserved for future directors, officers and employees.

(18) Stock Repurchase Program
     In  September  1998,  the Company's  Board of Directors  approved a program
         which allowed the Company to acquire  369,285 shares of common stock in
         the open market.  During 2002,  2001,  2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company
         repurchased  12,648,   19,936,   95,562,  147,102  and  32,025  shares,
         respectively or 3.4%, 5.4%, 25.9%,  39.8% and 8.7%,  respectively under
         this  program.  In  October  2002,  the  Company's  Board of  Directors
         authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  179,040 shares of the
         Company's  common stock in  open-market  transactions.  At December 31,
         2002,  the Company can still  repurchase an additional  241,052  shares
         under both programs.

(19)  Dividend Reinvestment Plan
     On  January 7, 2000, the Company  established a Dividend  Reinvestment Plan
         (the "DRP"). The DRP was approved by the Board of Directors on December
         30, 1999 and provides stockholders of record of at least 50 shares with
         a convenient  and  economical  way to  automatically  reinvest all or a
         portion of their cash  dividends and to invest  optional cash payments,
         subject to minimum  and maximum  purchase  limitations,  in  additional
         shares  of  common  stock.  Stockholders  pay  no  service  charges  or
         brokerage  commissions for common stock purchased under the DRP. During
         the years ended  December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000,  8,772,  19,341 and
         19,969 shares of common stock,  respectively,  were purchased under the
         DRP of which 0, 0 and 9,968 were new shares  issued by the  Company and
         8,772,  19,341 and 10,001  shares were  purchased  in the open  market,
         respectively in these periods.

                          Independent Auditors' Report



The Board of Directors
FFLC Bancorp, Inc.
Leesburg, Florida:

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FFLC Bancorp,
Inc. and  Subsidiaries  (the "Company") as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the
related consolidated  statements of income,  changes in stockholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period  ended  December 31,
2002.  These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

   We conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards  require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the results of its  operations and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year  period ended December 31, 2002 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
