ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business

FFLC Bancorp,  Inc.,  ("FFLC" or the "Company") was  incorporated in Delaware on
September 16, 1993, and acquired First Federal  Savings Bank of Lake County (the
"Bank") in  connection  with the Bank's  conversion  to stock form on January 4,
1994. The Company is a savings and loan holding company subject to regulation by
the Office of Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS") which transacts its business  through
its subsidiary,  the Bank. At December 31, 1999, the Company had total assets of
$590.4 million and stockholders' equity of $55.6 million.

The Bank was  established  in 1934 as a  federally-chartered  mutual savings and
loan  association.  The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank  ("FHLB")
System and its deposit  accounts are insured to the maximum  allowable amount by
the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC").  At December 31, 1999, the
Bank had total  assets  of  $590.4  million  and  stockholders'  equity of $52.4
million.

The  principal  business  of the Bank is  attracting  retail  deposits  from the
general  public  and  investing  those  deposits,  together  with  payments  and
repayments  on loans  and  investments  and  funds  generated  from  operations,
primarily in mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family  owner-occupied homes,
commercial  real  estate  loans  and  securities,   and,  to  a  lesser  extent,
construction, consumer, commercial and other loans, and multi-family residential
mortgage loans.  In addition,  the Bank holds  investments  permitted by federal
laws and  regulations  including  securities  issued by the U.S.  Government and
agencies thereof.  The Bank's revenues are derived  principally from interest on
its mortgage loan and  mortgage-backed  securities  portfolios  and interest and
dividends on its investment securities.

Market Area and Competition

The Bank is a  community-oriented  savings  institution  offering  a variety  of
financial  services to meet the needs of the  communities it serves.  The Bank's
deposit  gathering  and  lending  markets  are  primarily  concentrated  in  the
communities  surrounding its full service  offices  located in Lake,  Sumter and
Citrus  counties  in central  Florida.  The Bank's  competition  for loans comes
principally from commercial banks,  savings  institutions,  and mortgage banking
companies.  The Bank's most direct competition for savings has historically come
from commercial banks,  savings  institutions and credit unions.  The Bank faces
additional  competition  for savings  from  money-market  mutual funds and other
corporate  and  government  securities  funds.  The Bank  also  faces  increased
competition for deposits from other financial  intermediaries such as securities
brokerage firms and insurance companies.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
The Company"s market risk arises primarily from  interest-rate  risk inherent in
its lending and deposit  taking  activities.  To that end,  management  actively
monitors and manages its interest-rate risk exposure.  The measurement of market
risk associated  with financial  instruments is meaningful only when all related
and offsetting on- and  off-balance-sheet  transactions are aggregated,  and the
resulting  net  positions are  identified.  Disclosures  about the fair value of
financial instruments,  which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company"s  primary objective in managing  interest-rate  risk is to minimize
the  adverse  impact of changes  in  interest  rates on the Bank"s net  interest
income and capital,  and to adjust the  Company"s  asset-liability  structure to
obtain the maximum  yield-cost  spread on that  structure.  The  Company  relies
primarily  on its  asset-liability  management  to control  interest-rate  risk.
However,  a sudden and  substantial  increase  in interest  rates may  adversely
impact the Company"s  earnings,  to the extent that the interest  rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed,  to the same extent,  or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

Lending Activities

Loan  Portfolio.  The Bank's loan portfolio  consists  primarily of conventional
first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family  residences.  At December 31,
1999, the Bank's total gross loans  outstanding  were $519.0  million,  of which
$354.3   million  or  68.28%  of  the   Bank's   total   loan   portfolio   were
one-to-four-family  residential first mortgage loans. Of the  one-to-four-family
residential  mortgage  loans  outstanding  at that date,  37.44% were fixed rate
loans  and  62.56%  were  adjustable-rate  ("ARM")  loans.  At  the  same  date,
commercial  real estate  loans and other loans on improved  real estate  totaled
$61.1  million,  or 11.76% of the  Bank's  total  loan  portfolio;  construction
(excluding construction/permanent loans) and land loans totaled $11.9 million or
2.29% of the Bank's  total  loan  portfolio;  and  multi-family  mortgage  loans
totaled  $13.4  million or 2.58% of the Bank's total loan  portfolio.  Consumer,
commercial and other loans held by the Bank, which  principally  consist of home
equity  loans,  deposit,  consumer,  commercial  and other loans,  totaled $78.3
million or 15.09% of the Bank's total loan portfolio at December 31, 1999.

Purchase of Mortgage Loans. From time to time, the Bank purchases mortgage loans
originated by other lenders.  At December 31, 1999, $2.0 million, or .38% of the
Bank's  total loan  portfolio  consisted  of  purchased  mortgage  loans or loan
participations. Purchased mortgage loans consist primarily of one-to-four-family
residential mortgage loans.

Secondary  Market  Activities.  The Bank  participates  in the secondary  market
through a  correspondent  relationship,  originating  loans  (primarily  30-year
fixed-rate loans) which are funded by the investor correspondent. Funding by the
correspondent eliminates the Bank's interest-rate risk on such loans. Such loans
are  closed  on the  Bank's  documents  with  funds  provided  by  the  investor
correspondent at closing with all credit conditions  established by the investor
correspondent  being satisfied prior to the issuance of a loan  commitment.  The
Bank  receives  a fee for  originating,  processing  and  closing  the loans and
reports  the loans to the OTS as loans  originated  and sold.  In the year ended
December 31, 1999, such loans amounted to $7.0 million or 4.5% of total mortgage
loans originated.

Loan  Originations,  Purchases,  Sales and Principal  Repayments.  The following
table sets forth the Bank's loan  originations,  purchases,  sales and principal
repayments for the periods indicated.

One-to-Four-Family  Mortgage Lending.  The Bank's primary lending emphasis is on
the origination of first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family residences
within its primary  lending area.  Such  residences are primarily  single family
homes, including condominium and townhouses, that serve as the primary residence
of the owner.  To a lesser  degree,  the Bank makes loans on residences  used as
second homes or as investments. The Bank also offers second mortgage loans which
are underwritten applying the same standards as for first mortgage loans.

In the years ended  December 31, 1997,  1998 and 1999, the Bank's total mortgage
loan originations amounted to $117.4 million, $119.5 million and $154.2 million,
respectively,  of which  $87.0  million,  $107.4  million  and  $136.5  million,
respectively, were secured by one-to-four-family properties.

At  December  31,  1999,   68.28%  of  total  loans   receivable   consisted  of
one-to-four-family residential loans, of which 62.56% were ARM loans. The Bank's
ARM  loans  may  carry an  initial  interest  rate  which is less than the fully
indexed rate for the loan. The initial discounted rate is determined by the Bank
in accordance with market and competitive  factors. The Bank offers one-, three-
and five-year ARM loans which adjust by a maximum of 2% per  adjustment  period,
with lifetime caps on increases of 5% to 6%, depending upon the program chosen.

The Bank's policy on one-to-four-family  residential mortgage loans generally is
to lend up to 80% of the appraised value of property securing the loan, or up to
95% if private  mortgage  insurance  is obtained on the amount of the loan which
exceeds 80%.

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending.  As of December 31, 1999, $61.1
million,  or 11.76% of the Bank's total loan  portfolio  consisted of commercial
real  estate  loans  and  $13.4  million,  or 2.58%  of the  Bank's  total  loan
portfolio, consisted of multi-family residential loans.

The commercial real estate loans in the Bank's  portfolio  consist of fixed-rate
and ARM loans which were  originated  at  prevailing  market  rates.  The Bank's
policy  has been to  originate  commercial  or  multi-family  loans  only in its
primary market area. Commercial and multi-family residential loans are generally
made in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property. In making such
loans,  the Bank primarily  considers the net operating  income generated by the
real estate to support the debt  service,  the  financial  resources  and income
level  and  managerial  expertise  of the  borrower,  the  marketability  of the
property and the Bank's lending experience with the borrower.

Commercial  Loans. As of December 31, 1999, $14.3 million or 2.75% of the Bank"s
total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans.

Construction   and  Land  Loans.  The  Bank  originates  loans  to  finance  the
construction  of  one-to-four-family   homes  and,  to  a  much  lesser  extent,
originates loans for the acquisition and development of land (either  unimproved
land or improved  lots) on which the purchaser  can then build.  At December 31,
1999,  construction  (excluding  construction/permanent  loans)  and land  loans
totaled $11.9 million or 2.29% of the Bank's total loan portfolio.

At December 31, 1999, the Bank had loans in process  (undisbursed  loan proceeds
of construction  loans) of $15.9 million which was mainly secured by residential
mortgages.  The Bank makes  residential  construction  loans to  homeowners on a
long-term basis with  amortization  beginning at the conclusion of construction,
usually  a  period  of  about  six  months.   Such  loans  are  carried  in  the
one-to-four-family  category and are not separately  classified as  construction
loans.   Residential   construction   loans  to  builders  are  carried  in  the
construction and land category.
<PAGE>
Construction   and   land   loans   also   include    construction   loans   for
one-to-four-family  residential  property  for which the  borrower  will  obtain
permanent  financing  from  another  lender.  Such  loans  bear a fixed  rate of
interest that equals prime plus 1.0% during the  construction  period.  The Bank
obtains a commitment for the permanent  financing from the other lender prior to
originating the construction loan.

Consumer  Lending.  At December 31, 1999,  $64.0 million or 12.34% of the Bank's
total loan portfolio  consisted of consumer loans,  including home equity loans,
lines of credit  and  direct  and  indirect  auto and truck  loans for  consumer
purposes  and,  to a lesser  extent,  home  improvement  loans and  secured  and
unsecured personal loans.

The Bank's home equity loans are  originated on  one-to-four-family  residences,
either on a  fixed-rate  basis with terms of up to 15 years or as balloon  loans
with terms up to five years with fifteen year amortization periods.  Those loans
are  generally  limited to aggregate  outstanding  indebtedness  on the property
securing the loan of 90% of the loan to value  ratio.  The Bank also offers home
equity lines of credit,  which bear prime-based  adjustable  interest rates with
terms up to fifteen years.  Such loans  generally  require  monthly  payments of
interest plus 1.5% of the balance outstanding.

Consumer loans are offered primarily on a fixed-rate,  short-term basis.  Except
for second  mortgage  loans which are  underwritten  pursuant  to the  standards
applicable to one-to-four-family  residential loans, the underwriting  standards
employed  by  the  Bank  for  consumer  loans  include  a  determination  of the
applicant's  payment  history on other debts and an assessment of the borrower's
ability to make payments on the proposed loan and other indebtedness.

Loan  Approval  and  Authority.  Mortgage  loan  approval  authority  for  loans
exceeding  $1,000,000  is vested in the  Executive  Committee of the Board which
meets weekly to consider loan  recommendations  of the Loan Committee.  The Loan
Committee is comprised of three outside directors,  the President and the Senior
Lending  Officers  of the Bank  and has  been  delegated  authority  to  approve
mortgage  loans,  home equity  loans,  home  equity  lines of credit and secured
consumer loans up to $1,000,000.

The Bank's  policy is to require  title and hazard  insurance on all real estate
loans, except home equity loans for which a title search is conducted in lieu of
obtaining title  insurance.  Borrowers may be permitted to pay real estate taxes
and hazard insurance premiums  applicable to the secured property for a mortgage
loan. In some  instances,  borrowers  may be required to advance funds  together
with each payment of principal  and interest to a mortgage  escrow  account from
which the Bank makes  disbursements for items such as real estate taxes,  hazard
insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums.

Asset Quality

Delinquent  Loans  and  Nonperforming  Assets.  Loans  are  generally  placed on
nonaccrual  status when the  collection  of  principal or interest is 90 days or
more past due, or earlier if collection is deemed  uncertain.  The Bank provides
an  allowance  for  accrued  interest  deemed  uncollectible.  Accrued  interest
receivable is reported net of the allowance for uncollected interest.  Loans may
be  reinstated to accrual  status when all payments are brought  current and, in
the opinion of management, collection of the remaining balance can be reasonably
expected.

At December 31, 1999,  the Bank had no accruing  loans which were  contractually
past due 90 days or more as to  principal  and  interest  and no  troubled  debt
restructurings as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15.
Nonaccrual loans for which interest has been reduced totaled  approximately $2.4
million,   $444,000  and   $242,000  at  December  31,  1999,   1998  and  1997,

Classified  Assets.  Federal  regulations  and the  Bank's  policy  require  the
classification  of loans and other assets,  such as debt and equity  securities,
considered  to be of  lesser  quality  as  "substandard",  "doubtful"  or "loss"
assets. An asset is considered  "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by
the  current net worth and paying  capacity of the obligor or of the  collateral
pledged,  if  any.  "Substandard"  assets  include  those  characterized  by the
"distinct  possibility"  that the  institution  will sustain  "some loss" if the
deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the

<PAGE>

weaknesses   inherent  in  those  classified   "substandard,"   with  the  added
characteristic  that the weaknesses  present make  "collection or liquidation in
full", on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, "highly
questionable and improbable."  Assets  classified as "loss" are those considered
"uncollectible"  and of such  little  value  that  their  continuance  as assets
without  the  establishment  of a specific  loss  reserve is not  warranted.  In
addition,  the Bank's policies require that assets which do not currently expose
the  insured  institution  to  sufficient  risk  to  warrant  classification  as
substandard  but possess other  weaknesses are designated  "special  mention" by
management.



                                       11
<PAGE>
If an asset is  classified,  the estimated fair value of the asset is determined
and if that  value is less  than  the then  carrying  value  of the  asset,  the
difference is  established as a specific  reserve.  If an asset is classified as
loss, the amount of the asset  classified as loss is reserved.  General reserves
or  general  valuation  allowances  represent  loss  allowances  which have been
established to recognize the inherent risk  associated  with lending  activities
but, unlike specific reserves, are not allocated to particular assets.

The  following  table sets forth  information  concerning  the number and dollar
amount of loans  and real  estate  owned  classified  as  "special  mention"  or
"substandard"  at the  dates  indicated.  No loans  or real  estate  owned  were
classified "doubtful" or "loss" at those dates.

Allowance for Loan Losses.  The Bank's  allowance for loan losses is established
and  maintained  through  a  provision  for loan  losses  based on  management's
evaluation of the risk  inherent in its loan  portfolio and the condition of the
local  economy in the Bank's  market area.  Such  evaluation,  which  includes a
review of all loans on which full  collectibility may not be reasonably assured,
considers,  among other  matters,  the  estimated  fair value of the  underlying
collateral,  economic and regulatory conditions,  and other factors that warrant
recognition  in  providing  for  an  adequate  loan  loss  allowance.   Although
management   believes   it  uses  the  best   information   available   to  make
determinations  with respect to the Bank's  allowance  for loan  losses,  future
adjustments may be necessary if economic  conditions vary substantially from the
economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations
or if other circumstances change.

Investment Activities

The  investment  policy  of the  Bank,  which  is  established  by the  Board of
Directors and  implemented by the Chief  Executive  Officer who is designated as
the Investment Officer, is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity,
to generate a favorable return on investments  without  incurring undue interest
rate and credit  risk,  and to  complement  the Bank's  lending  activities.  In
establishing  its  investment  strategies,  the Bank  considers its business and
growth plans, the economic  environment,  the types of securities to be held and
other factors.  Federally  chartered savings  institutions have the authority to
invest  in  various  types  of  assets,  including  U.S.  Treasury  obligations,
securities  of various  federal  agencies,  certain  certificates  of deposit of
insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers acceptances,  repurchase
agreements,  loans on federal funds, and, subject to certain limits,  commercial
paper and mutual funds.

On January 1, 1994,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 115.  That  statement  requires  investment  and  mortgage-backed
securities  that the  Company  has the  positive  intent and  ability to hold to
maturity  to be  classified  as  held-to-maturity  securities  and  reported  at
amortized  cost.  Securities  that are held  principally for selling in the near
term are to be classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with
unrealized  gains and losses included in earnings.  Securities not classified as
either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are to be classified as
available-for-sale  securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported in a separate  component  of
stockholders' equity.

The Company adopted FAS 133 effective July 1, 1999. As allowed by this standard,
the Company  reclassified  all securities  held to maturity with a book value of
$14,784,000  and a market value of  $14,969,000 to available for sale on July 1,
1999.

Mortgage-Backed Securities

The  Bank  invests  in   collateralized   mortgage   obligations   ("CMOs")  and
mortgage-backed  securities  such as government  pass-through  certificates.  At
December 31, 1999, the Bank's mortgage-backed securities portfolio totaled $17.4
million, or 2.96% of total assets. The mortgage-backed securities are not due at
a single maturity date, and accordingly, contractual maturity information is not
presented  herein.  CMOs, net of related  premiums and  discounts,  totaled $2.3
million or 13.10% of total mortgage-backed securities.

CMOs are typically issued by a special purpose entity, which may be organized in
any  of  a  variety  of  legal  forms,  such  as a  trust,  a  corporation  or a
partnership.  The entity  combines pools of pass-through  securities,  which are
used to collateralize the mortgage related securities.  Once combined,  the cash
flows can be divided into  different  "tranches"  or  "classes"  of  securities,
thereby creating more predictable average lives for each tranch or class than is
provided  by the  underlying  pass-through  pools.  Under  this  structure,  all
principal  repayments  from the various  mortgage  pools can be  allocated  to a
mortgage-related  securities class or classes  structured to have priority until
it has been paid off.  Thus,  these  securities  are  designed  to  address  the
reinvestment  concerns associated with mortgage-backed  security  pass-throughs,
namely that they tend to pay off more  rapidly  when  interest  rates fall.  The
Bank's CMOs have  coupon  rates  ranging  from 6.09% to 7.00% and had a weighted
average yield of 6.54% at December 31, 1999.
<PAGE>
The  Bank's  policy  is to  purchase  CMOs  rated  AA or  better  by  nationally
recognized  rating  services.  The  majority  of the CMOs  owned by the Bank are
insured or guaranteed  either  directly or indirectly,  through  mortgage-backed

general purposes.

Deposits.  The Bank  offers a  variety  of  deposit  accounts  having a range of
interest  rates and terms.  The  Bank's  deposits  consist  of regular  savings,

Borrowings

The Bank is  authorized  to  obtain  advances  from the  Federal  Home Loan Bank
("FHLB") of Atlanta which are generally collateralized by a blanket lien against
the Bank's  mortgage  portfolio.  Such  advances may be made pursuant to several
different credit programs,  each of which has its own interest rate and range of
maturities.  The maximum  amount that the FHLB of Atlanta will advance to member
institutions,  including the Bank, for purposes other than meeting  withdrawals,
fluctuates  from time to time in  accordance  with the  policies  of the Federal
Housing  Finance Board and the FHLB of Atlanta.  At December 31, 1999,  the Bank
had $99.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding.

During 1997, the Bank entered into agreements with nationally recognized primary
securities  dealers under which the Bank sells securities  subject to repurchase
agreements.  Such agreements are accounted for as borrowings by the Bank and are
secured by the securities  sold. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Bank did not
have any such  borrowings  outstanding.  During 1998,  the Bank began  borrowing
under retail repurchase  agreements with customers of the Bank. These agreements
are also accounted for as borrowings and are secured by securities  owned by the
Bank.

The  following  table  sets forth  certain  information  relating  to the Bank's
borrowings at the dates indicated:

Subsidiary Activities

The  Bank has one  wholly-owned  subsidiary;  Lake  County  Service  Corporation
("LCSC") formed to develop a 100-lot  subdivision,  which is substantially  sold
out.  During 1999,  LCSC sold an 8.4 acre  commercial  parcel and a one-acre lot
that  adjoins the Bank's  main  office.  The gain on the sale of the  commercial
property  was  $553,000  after tax and $886,000  before tax.  During 1999,  LCSC
purchased two commercial  building  sites for possible  future bank branches and
purchased an existing branch building in Inverness, which is rented to the Bank.

Personnel

As of February 14, 2000,  the Bank had 166 full-time  employees and 15 part-time
employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and
the Bank considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

General

As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is required by federal law to
file reports with, and otherwise  comply with, the rules and  regulations of the
OTS. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by
the OTS, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the deposit insurer.
The Bank is a member of the Federal  Home Loan Bank System and,  with respect to
deposit insurance, of the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") managed by
the FDIC.  The Bank must file reports with the OTS and the FDIC  concerning  its
activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals
prior  to  entering  into  certain   transactions   such  as  mergers  with,  or
acquisitions  of, other  savings  institutions.  The OTS and/or the FDIC conduct
periodic  examinations  to test the Bank's safety and  soundness and  compliance
with  various   regulatory   requirements.   This   regulation  and  supervision
establishes a comprehensive  framework of activities in which an institution can
engage and is intended  primarily for the  protection of the insurance  fund and
depositors.  The  regulatory  structure  also gives the  regulatory  authorities
extensive  discretion  in  connection  with their  supervisory  and  enforcement
activities  and  examination  policies,  including  policies with respect to the
classification  of assets and the  establishment  of adequate loan loss reserves
for  regulatory  purposes.  Any  change  in  such  regulatory  requirements  and
policies,  whether by the OTS, the FDIC or the  Congress,  could have a material
adverse  impact on the Company,  the Bank and their  operations.  Certain of the
regulatory  requirements  applicable to the Bank and to the Company are referred
to below or  elsewhere  herein.  The  description  of statutory  provisions  and
regulations  applicable to savings  institutions and their holding companies set
forth in this Form 10-K does not  purport to be a complete  description  of such
statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company.

Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a nondiversified  unitary savings and loan holding company within
the meaning of federal law. Under prior law, a unitary  savings and loan holding
company,  such as the Company was not  generally  restricted  as to the types of
business activities in which it may engage,  provided that the Bank continued to
be a qualified thrift lender. See "Federal Savings Institution  Regulation - QTL
Test." The  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act of 1999 provides that no company may acquire
control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the
financial  activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or
for multiple savings and loan holding companies as described below. Further, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley   Act  specifies  that  existing  savings  and  loan  holding
companies  may only  engage  in such  activities.  The  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act,
however, grandfathered the unrestricted authority for activities with respect to
unitary savings and loan holding  companies  existing prior to May 4, 1999, such
as the Company,  so long as the Bank continues to comply with the QTL Test. Upon
any non-supervisory acquisition by the Company of another savings institution or
Bank that meets the  qualified  thrift lender test and is deemed to be a savings
institution  by the OTS, the Company  would  become a multiple  savings and loan
holding company (if the acquired  institution is held as a separate  subsidiary)
and would  generally  be  limited to  activities  permissible  for bank  holding
companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act,  subject to the
prior approval of the OTS, and certain activities authorized by OTS regulation.

                                       22
<PAGE>
A savings and loan holding company is prohibited  from,  directly or indirectly,
acquiring  more than 5% of the voting stock of another  savings  institution  or
savings and loan holding company,  without prior written approval of the OTS and
from  acquiring or retaining  control of a  depository  institution  that is not
insured by the FDIC. In evaluating  applications by holding companies to acquire
savings  institutions,  the OTS considers the financial and managerial resources
and future prospects of the company and institution involved,  the effect of the
acquisition on the risk to the deposit  insurance  funds,  the  convenience  and
needs of the community and competitive factors.

The OTS may not approve any acquisition  that would result in a multiple savings
and loan  holding  company  controlling  savings  institutions  in more than one
state,  subject to two  exceptions:  (i) the approval of interstate  supervisory
acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a
savings  institution  in  another  state if the laws of the state of the  target
savings institution  specifically  permit such acquisitions.  The states vary in
the extent to which they  permit  interstate  savings and loan  holding  company
acquisitions.

Although savings and loan holding  companies are not subject to specific capital
requirements  or  specific  restrictions  on the payment of  dividends  or other
capital  distributions,  federal  regulations do prescribe such  restrictions on
subsidiary savings institutions as described below. The Bank must notify the OTS
30 days before declaring any dividend to the Company. In addition, the financial
impact of a holding  company on its  subsidiary  institution is a matter that is
evaluated  by the OTS  and the  agency  has  authority  to  order  cessation  of
activities or divestiture of subsidiaries  deemed to pose a threat to the safety
and soundness of the institution.

Federal Savings Institution Regulation

Business Activities. The activities of federal savings institutions are governed
by federal law and regulations.  These laws and regulations delineate the nature
and extent of the  activities  in which  federal  associations  may  engage.  In
particular,  many types of lending  authority  for  federal  association,  e.g.,
commercial,  non-residential real property loans and consumer loans, are limited
to a specified percentage of the institution's capital or assets.

Capital  Requirements.  The OTS capital regulations require savings institutions
to meet three minimum  capital  standards:  a 1.5% tangible  capital ratio, a 4%
leverage ratio (3% for  institutions  receiving the highest rating on the CAMELS
rating  system) and an 8%  risk-based  capital  ratio.  In addition,  the prompt
corrective action standards discussed below also establish, in effect, a minimum
2% tangible capital standard, a 4% leverage ratio (3% for institutions receiving
the highest  rating on the CAMEL  financial  institution  rating  system),  and,
together with the risk-based  capital  standard  itself,  a 4% Tier 1 risk-based
capital  standard.  The OTS  regulations  also  require  that,  in  meeting  the
tangible, leverage and risk-based capital standards, institutions must generally
deduct  investments  in and  loans to  subsidiaries  engaged  in  activities  as
principal that are not permissible for a national bank.

The  risk-based   capital  standard  for  savings   institutions   requires  the
maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital
and  supplementary  capital)  to  risk-weighted  assets  of at  least 4% and 8%,
respectively.  In determining the amount of  risk-weighted  assets,  all assets,
including  certain  off-balance  sheet assets,  are  multiplied by a risk-weight
<PAGE>
factor of 0% to 100%,  assigned by the OTS capital regulation based on the risks
believed  inherent  in the type of asset.  Core  (Tier 1)  capital is defined as
common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock and related surplus,  and minority interests in equity
accounts  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  less  intangibles  other than  certain
mortgage  servicing  rights and credit card  relationships.  The  components  of
supplementary  capital currently include cumulative  preferred

                                       23
<PAGE>
stock,  long-term perpetual preferred stock,  mandatory convertible  securities,
subordinated  debt and intermediate  preferred stock, the allowance for loan and
lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45%
of  unrealized  gains  on  available-for-sale  equity  securities  with  readily
determinable fair market values.  Overall,  the amount of supplementary  capital
included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital.

The  capital  regulations  also  incorporate  an interest  rate risk  component.
Savings institutions with "above normal" interest rate risk exposure are subject
to a deduction from total capital for purposes of calculating  their  risk-based
capital requirements.  For the present time, the OTS has deferred implementation
of the interest  rate risk capital  charge.  At December 31, 1999,  the Bank met
each of its capital requirements.

The following table presents the Bank's capital position at December 31, 1999.

</TABLE>

Prompt  Corrective  Regulatory  Action.  The OTS is  required  to  take  certain
supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which
depends  upon the  institution's  degree of  undercapitalization.  Generally,  a
savings institution that has a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of
less than 8%, a ratio of Tier 1 (core) capital to  risk-weighted  assets of less
than 4% or a ratio of core  capital to total  assets of less than 4% (3% or less
for  institutions  with the  highest  examination  rating) is  considered  to be
"undercapitalized."  A savings  institution that has a total risk-based  capital
ratio less than 6%, a Tier 1 capital  ratio of less than 3% or a leverage  ratio
that is less than 3% is considered to be "significantly  undercapitalized" and a
savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less
than 2% is  deemed  to be  "critically  undercapitalized."  Subject  to a narrow
exception,  the OTS is  required  to appoint a receiver  or  conservator  for an
institution that is "critically  undercapitalized." The regulation also provides
that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OTS within 45 days of the
date a  savings  institution  receives  notice  that  it is  "undercapitalized,"
"significantly  undercapitalized" or "critically  undercapitalized."  Compliance
with the plan must be guaranteed  by any parent  holding  company.  In addition,
numerous  mandatory  supervisory  actions  become  immediately  applicable to an
undercapitalized   institution,   including,   but  not  limited  to,  increased
monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth,  capital  distributions and
expansion.  The OTS  could  also  take  any  one of a  number  of  discretionary
supervisory  actions,  including  the  issuance of a capital  directive  and the
replacement of senior executive officers and directors.

Insurance  of  Deposit  Accounts.  The Bank is a member  of the  SAIF.  The FDIC
maintains a risk-based  assessment system by which  institutions are assigned to
one of  three  categories  based  on  their  capitalization  and  one  of  three
subcategories based on examination ratings and other supervisory information. An
institution's  assessment  rate  depends  upon  the  categories  to  which it is
assigned.   Assessment  rates  for  SAIF  member   institutions  are  determined
semiannually  by the FDIC and  currently  range from zero  basis  points for the
healthiest institutions to 27 basis points for the riskiest.

                                       24

<PAGE>
In addition to the assessment for deposit  insurance,  institutions are required
to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing  Corporation
("FICO") to recapitalize the predecessor to the SAIF. During 1999, FICO payments
for SAIF  members  approximated  6.1 basis  points,  while Bank  Insurance  Fund
("BIF")  members paid 1.2 basis points.  By law,  there is equal sharing of FICO
payments between SAIF and BIF members beginning on January 1, 2000.

The Bank paid no assessment for 1999, however its payments toward the FICO bonds
amounted to $213,749.  The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments.
A significant  increase in SAIF insurance  premiums would likely have an adverse
effect  on the  operating  expenses  and  results  of  operations  of the  Bank.
Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.

Insurance  of deposits  may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a finding  that the
institution  has  engaged  in unsafe or  unsound  practices,  is in an unsafe or
unsound  condition to continue  operations or has violated any  applicable  law,
regulation,  rule,  order or  condition  imposed  by the  FDIC or the  OTS.  The
management  of the Bank does not know of any  practice,  condition  or violation
that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

Loans to One  Borrower.  Federal law  provides  that  savings  institutions  are
generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower  applicable to national
banks. A savings institution may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or
related  group of  borrowers  in excess  of 15% of its  unimpaired  capital  and
surplus.  An additional  amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired  capital
and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable  collateral. At December
31, 1999,  the Bank's limit on loans to one borrower was $8.1  million,  and the
Bank's largest aggregate  outstanding  balance of loans to one borrower was $7.6
million.

QTL Test.  The HOLA requires  savings  institutions  to meet a qualified  thrift
lender test. Under the test, a savings association is required to either qualify
as a "domestic building and loan association" under the Internal Revenue Code or
maintain  at  least  65% of its  "portfolio  assets"  (total  assets  less:  (i)
specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets;  (ii) intangibles,  including
goodwill;  and (iii) the value of property used to conduct  business) in certain
"qualified  thrift  investments"  (primarily  residential  mortgages and related
investments,  including certain mortgage-backed securities) in at least 9 months
out of each 12 month period.

A savings  institution that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to
certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a bank charter.
As of December 31, 1999, the Bank maintained  79.30% of its portfolio  assets in
qualified  thrift  investments and,  therefore,  met the qualified thrift lender
test.  Recent  legislation  has  expanded the extent to which  education  loans,
credit card loans and small business loans may be considered  "qualified  thrift
investments."

Limitation on Capital Distributions. OTS regulations impose limitations upon all
capital  distributions  by a  savings  institution,  including  cash  dividends,
payments  to  repurchase  its shares and  payments  to  shareholders  of another
institution  in a cash-out  merger.  The rule  effective in the first quarter of
1999 established three tiers of institutions based primarily on an institution's
capital level. An institution that exceeded all capital  requirements before and
after a proposed capital  distribution  ("Tier 1 Bank") and had not been advised
by the OTS that it was in need of more than  normal  supervision,  could,  after
prior  notice  but  without   obtaining   approval  of  the  OTS,  make  capital
distributions  during the calendar  year equal to the greater of (i) 100% of its
net earnings to date during the calendar  year plus the amount that would reduce
by one-half the excess capital over its capital requirements at the beginning of
the calendar year or (ii) 75% of its net income for the previous four  quarters.
Any  additional

                                       23
<PAGE>
capital  distributions  required prior regulatory  approval.  Effective April 1,
1999,  the  OTS's  capital  distribution   regulation  changed.  Under  the  new
regulation,  an  application  to and the prior  approval  of the OTS is required
prior to any capital  distribution if the institution does not meet the criteria
for  "expedited   treatment"  of  applications   under  OTS  regulations  (i.e.,
generally,  examination  ratings in the two top  categories),  the total capital
distributions  for the  calendar  year  exceed net income for that year plus the
amount of retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would
be  undercapitalized  following  the  distribution  or  the  distribution  would
otherwise  be contrary to a statute,  regulation  or  agreement  with OTS. If an
application is not required,  the institution must still provide prior notice to
OTS of the capital  distribution  if,  like the Bank,  it is a  subsidiary  of a
holding  company.  In the event the Bank's  capital  fell  below its  regulatory
requirements  or the OTS  notified  it that it was in need of more  than  normal
supervision,   the  Bank's  ability  to  make  capital  distributions  could  be
restricted.  In addition, the OTS could prohibit a proposed capital distribution
by any institution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the
OTS  determines  that such  distribution  would  constitute an unsafe or unsound
practice.

Liquidity.  The Bank is  required  to  maintain  an  average  daily  balance  of
specified  liquid assets equal to a monthly average of not less than a specified
percentage of its net withdrawable deposit accounts plus short-term  borrowings.
This liquidity requirement is currently 4%, but may be changed from time to time
by the OTS to any amount within the range of 4% to 10%.  Monetary  penalties may
be  imposed  for  failure  to meet  these  liquidity  requirements.  The  Bank's
liquidity  ratio for December 31, 1999 was 18.7%,  which exceeded the applicable
requirements.  The Bank has never been subject to monetary penalties for failure
to meet its liquidity requirements.

Assessments.  Savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the OTS to
fund the agency's  operations.  The general  assessments,  paid on a semi-annual
basis,  are computed  upon the savings  institution's  total  assets,  including
consolidated  subsidiaries,  as reported in the Bank's latest  quarterly  thrift
financial  report.  The Bank was not  assessed  any payments for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1999.

Transactions   with  Related   Parties.   The  Bank's  authority  to  engage  in
transactions  with  "affiliates"  (e.g.,  any company that  controls or is under
common control with an  institution,  including the Company and its  non-savings
institution  subsidiaries)  is limited by federal law. The  aggregate  amount of
covered  transactions  with any  individual  affiliate  is limited to 10% of the
capital and surplus of the savings institution.  The aggregate amount of covered
transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings  institution's
capital and surplus.  Certain  transactions  with  affiliates are required to be
secured by collateral  in an amount and of a type  described in federal law. The
purchase of low quality  assets from  affiliates  is generally  prohibited.  The
transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances,  that are
at least as favorable to the  institution  as those  prevailing  at the time for
comparable  transactions with  non-affiliated  companies.  In addition,  savings
institutions  are  prohibited  from lending to any affiliate  that is engaged in
activities that are not  permissible  for bank holding  companies and no savings
institution   may  purchase  the  securities  of  any  affiliate  other  than  a
subsidiary.
<PAGE>
The Bank's authority to extend credit to executive  officers,  directors and 10%
shareholders  ("insiders"),  as well as entities such persons  control,  is also
governed  by  federal  law.  Such  loans  are  required  to  be  made  on  terms
substantially  the same as those  offered to  unaffiliated  individuals  and not
involve more than the normal risk of repayment.  Recent  legislation  created an
exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or  compensation  program that is
widely  available  to all  employees  of  the  institution  and  does  not  give
preference to insiders over other employees.  The law limits both the


                                       26
<PAGE>
individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in
part,  on the Bank's  capital  position  and  requires  certain  board  approval
procedures to be followed.

Enforcement.  The  OTS  has  primary  enforcement  responsibility  over  savings
institutions  and has the authority to bring actions against the institution and
all institution-affiliated  parties, including stockholders,  and any attorneys,
appraisers and accountants  who knowingly or recklessly  participate in wrongful
action  likely to have an  adverse  effect  on an  insured  institution.  Formal
enforcement  action may range from the issuance of a capital  directive or cease
and desist  order to removal of officers  and/or  directors  to  institution  of
receivership,   conservatorship  or  termination  of  deposit  insurance.  Civil
penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or
even  $1  million  per day in  especially  egregious  cases.  The  FDIC  has the
authority to recommend to the Director of the OTS that enforcement  action to be
taken with respect to a particular savings  institution.  If action is not taken
by the  Director,  the FDIC has  authority  to take such  action  under  certain
circumstances.  Federal  law also  establishes  criminal  penalties  for certain
violations.

Standards for Safety and Soundness.  The federal  banking  agencies have adopted
Interagency  Guidelines  prescribing  Standards  for Safety and  Soundness.  The
guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking
agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions
before  capital  becomes  impaired.   If  the  OTS  determines  that  a  savings
institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OTS may
require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve  compliance with
the standard.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System,  which consists of 12
regional  Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central
credit facility primarily for member institutions.  The Bank, as a member of the
Federal Home Loan Bank,  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock
in that  Federal  Home  Loan  Bank in an  amount  at least  equal to 1.0% of the
aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential  mortgage loans and similar
obligations at the beginning of each year, or 1/20 of its advances  (borrowings)
from  the  Federal  Home  Loan  Bank,  whichever  is  greater.  The  Bank was in
compliance  with this  requirement  with an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank
stock at December 31, 1999 of $4.95 million.

The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for the  resolution of
insolvent  thrifts  in the late  1980s and to  contribute  funds for  affordable
housing programs.  These  requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that
the  Federal  Home Loan Banks pay to their  members and could also result in the
Federal Home Loan Banks  imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their
members. If dividends were reduced, or interest on future Federal Home Loan Bank
advances increased, The Bank's net interest income would likely also be reduced.
Recent  legislation  has changed the  structure  of the Federal  Home Loan Banks
funding obligations for insolvent thrifts,  revised the capital structure of the
Federal  Home Loan  Banks and  implemented  entirely  voluntary  membership  for
Federal Home Loan Banks. Management cannot predict the effect that these changes
may have with respect to its Federal Home Loan Bank membership.

                                       27
<PAGE>
Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve Board regulations  require savings  institutions to maintain
non-interest  earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW
and regular checking accounts).  The regulations generally provide that reserves
be maintained against aggregate  transaction  accounts as follows:  for accounts
aggregating  $44.3 million or less (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve
Board) the reserve requirement is 3%; and for accounts  aggregating greater than
$44.3  million,  the reserve  requirement is $1.329 million plus 10% (subject to
adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board between 8% and 14%) against that portion
of total transaction accounts in excess of $44.3 million. The first $5.0 million
of otherwise  reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve
Board) are exempted  from the reserve  requirements.  The Bank complies with the
foregoing requirements.

Year 2000

The Company's  operating and financial  systems have been found to be compliant;
the "Y2K Problem" has not adversely  affected the Company's  operations nor does
management expect that it will.

                           FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION

Federal Taxation

General.  The Company and the Bank report their income on a  consolidated  basis
using the  accrual  method of  accounting,  and are  subject to  federal  income
taxation  in the  same  manner  as  other  corporations  with  some  exceptions,
including  particularly  the Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed  below.  The
following  discussion  of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not
purport to be a  comprehensive  description  of the tax rules  applicable to the
Bank or the  Company.  The Bank was last  audited  by the IRS for the year ended
December 31, 1996.  For its 1999 taxable year,  the Bank is subject to a maximum
federal income tax rate of 34%.

Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning prior to December 31, 1995, thrift
institutions  which  qualified  under  certain   definitional  tests  and  other
conditions of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") were  permitted to
use certain  favorable  provisions to calculate  their  deductions  from taxable
income  for  annual  additions  to their bad debt  reserve.  A reserve  could be
established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans  (generally  secured
by  interests  in  real  property  improved  or to be  improved)  under  (i) the
Percentage of Taxable  Income  Method (the "PTI Method") or (ii) the  Experience
Method.  The reserve for  nonqualifying  loans was computed using the Experience
Method.

The Small  Business  Job  Protection  Act of 1996 (the  "1996  Act"),  which was
enacted on August 20, 1996,  requires  savings  institutions to recapture (i.e.,
take into income) certain portions of their  accumulated bad debt reserves.  The
1996 Act repeals the reserve  method of accounting  for bad debts  effective for
tax years beginning  after 1995.  Thrift  institutions  that would be treated as
small banks are  allowed to utilize the  Experience  Method  applicable  to such
institutions,  while thrift  institutions that are treated as large banks (those
generally  exceeding  $500  million  in  assets)  are  required  to use only the
specific charge-off method.  Thus, the PTI Method of accounting for bad debts is
no longer available for any financial institution.

A thrift institution required to change its method of computing reserves for bad
debts will treat such change as a change in method of  accounting,  initiated by
the  taxpayer,  and having  been made with the  consent of the IRS.  Any Section
481(a)  adjustment  required to be taken into income with respect to such change
generally  will be taken into income  ratably  over a  six-taxable  year period,
beginning  with the first  taxable  year  beginning  after 1995,  subject to the
residential loan requirement.

Under the residential loan requirement provision,  the recapture required by the
1996 Act is suspended for each of two successive  taxable years,  beginning with
1996, in which the Bank originates a minimum of certain  residential loans based
upon the average of the principal  amounts of such loans made by the Bank during
its six taxable years  preceding its current  taxable year.  Under the 1996 Act,
for its  current  and  future  taxable  years,  the  Bank is  permitted  to make
additions to its tax bad debt  reserves.  In  addition,  the Bank is required to
recapture  (i.e.,  take into  income)  over a six year  period the excess of the
balance of its tax bad debt reserves as of December 31, 1995 over the balance of
such  reserves as of December  31,  1987.  At December  31,  1999,  the Bank had
approximately $606,000 of deferred tax liabilities recorded for the recapture of
its bad debt reserves.

Distributions.   Under  the  1996   Act,   if  the  Bank   makes   "non-dividend
distributions"  to the Company,  such  distributions  will be considered to have
been made from the Bank's  unrecaptured  tax bad debt  reserves  (including  the
balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987) to the extent thereof, and then
from the Bank's supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent thereof,
and an amount based on the amount  distributed  (but not in excess of the amount
of  such  reserves)  will  be  included  in  the  Bank's  income.   Non-dividend
distributions  include  distributions  in  excess  of  the  Bank's  current  and
accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes,
distributions in redemption of stock,  and  distributions in partial or complete
liquidation.  Dividends paid out of the Bank's  current or accumulated  earnings
and profits will not be so included in the Bank's income.

The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount
that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount
of the distribution.  Thus, if the Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to the
Company,  approximately  one and one-half times the amount of such  distribution
(but not in excess of the amount of such reserves) would be includable in income
for federal  income tax purposes,  assuming a 35% federal  corporate  income tax
rate. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture
of any portion of its bad debt reserves.

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. The Code imposes a tax on alternative minimum
taxable income  ("AMTI") at a rate of 20%. For fiscal years  beginning  prior to
January  1,  1996,  the  excess  of the bad debt  reserve  deduction  using  the
percentage  of taxable  income  method over the  deduction  that would have been
allowable  under the  experience  method is  treated  as a  preference  item for
purposes of computing the AMTI.  Only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating
loss carryovers.  The adjustment to AMTI based on book income is an amount equal
to 75% of the amount by which a corporation's  adjusted current earnings exceeds
its AMTI  (determined  without regard to this  adjustment and prior to reduction
for net  operating  losses).  In addition,  for taxable  years  through 1995, an
environmental  tax of .12% of the  excess of AMTI (with  certain  modifications)
over $2.0 million is imposed on corporations, including the Bank, whether or not
an  Alternative  Minimum  Tax  ("AMT")  is paid.  The Bank does not expect to be
subject to the AMT.

Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters. The Company may exclude from its
income  100% of  dividends  received  from  the  Bank as a  member  of the  same
affiliated group of corporations.  The corporate dividends received deduction is
generally 70% in the case of dividends  received from unaffiliated  corporations
with which the  Company  and the Bank will not file a  consolidated  tax return,
except  that if the  Company  and the Bank own more  than 20% of the  stock of a
corporation  distributing  a  dividend,  80% of any  dividends  received  may be
deducted.

Florida  Taxation.  The Bank files Florida  franchise  tax returns.  For Florida
franchise tax purposes, savings institutions are presently taxed at a rate equal
to 5.5% of taxable income.  For this purpose,  "taxable income"  generally means
federal taxable income,  subject to certain adjustments  (including the addition
of  interest  income  on  State  and  municipal  obligations).  The  Bank is not
currently under audit with respect to its Florida franchise tax returns.

Subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of  preferred  stock

stockholder  to be  timely  must be so  received  not  later  than the  close of
business on the 10th day  following  the day on which such notice of the date of
the meeting was mailed or such public  disclosure was made.  Such  stockholder's
notice shall set forth (i) as to each person whom such  stockholder  proposes to
nominate for election or re-election as a Director,  all information relating to
such person that is required to be  disclosed  in  solicitations  of proxies for
election  of  Directors,  or is  otherwise  required,  in each case  pursuant to

information  required to be set forth in a  stockholder's  notice of  nomination

she shall so  declare  to the  meeting  and the  defective  nomination  shall be

procedures established for the meeting. The Board of Directors shall, in advance
of any meeting of  stockholders,  appoint one or more  inspectors  to act at the

stockholders, the Chairman of the Board, or in his absence such person presiding
at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.  Each

Dear Stockholders:

Once again, I am pleased to have the opportunity to present to our stockholders,
customers and friends,  information about the Company's  operations for the past
year.  We have again  enjoyed a successful  year,  and I would like to take this
opportunity  to  thank  all  of  you  - our  stockholders,  our  customers,  our
communities,  and our  employees  - for your  efforts  and  support  as we moved
through 1999 and into the year 2000.

We all had high  expectations for the transition to the new millennium,  and the
Company did indeed  experience a most eventful year. We enjoyed record  earnings
for the year,  opened three new branches,  and approved the  establishment  of a
dividend  reinvestment  plan for  stockholders.  First Federal Savings Bank, the
Company's subsidiary, again set records for total assets, total loan volume, and
total deposits. And, of course, we successfully navigated the Y2K transition!

For 1999,  the Company  earned $5.4 million,  a 23% increase over 1998. On a per
share  basis,  basic net income per share for 1999 was $1.52,  compared to $1.22
for 1998. As we previously reported to you, the 1999 consolidated  earnings were
positively impacted in the first quarter of 1999 by a $553,000 after-tax gain on
the  sale of  commercial  land  owned  by Lake  County  Service  Corporation,  a
subsidiary of the Bank.  Excluding  that gain,  the Company's  consolidated  net
income would have been $4.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 1999, a 10%
increase  when compared to 1998.  Basic income per share for 1999  excluding the
gain would have been $1.36, an increase of 11% over 1998.

Asset  growth  continues to be an  important  focal point for the  Company.  The
Company's  total assets grew from $463.8  million at December 31, 1998 to $590.4
million at December 31, 1999. During 1999, the Bank's loan originations  totaled
$238.2 million,  a 20% increase over the $198.7 million of originations in 1998.
Originations  of residential  loans were $133.3 million,  commercial  loans were
$59.2  million,  and consumer  loans were $45.7  million for 1999.  Those volume
levels  compare  to  $109.2   million,   $58.9   million,   and  $31.0  million,
respectively, for 1998.

The Company's  growth was funded by increases in the Bank's deposits and Federal
Home Loan Bank  advances.  During  1999,  the Bank's  deposits  grew from $351.0
million  to  $429.3  million,  an  increase  of 22%.  Of the total  increase  in
deposits,  checking and other transaction  accounts grew $17.6 million (or 19%),
while certificates of deposit grew $60.6 million (or 23%). During 1999, advances
from the Federal Home Loan Bank grew $43 million (77%),  from $56 million to $99
million.

As we look forward to 2000, we are excited about the  opportunity we have to add
interactive  Internet  banking  to our list of  banking  products.  We have been
working on the  development of our interactive  Internet  banking  product,  and
expect to be able to launch this project in the second  quarter of 2000.  We are
also  excited  about  the  opening  in mid 2000 of our new  Loan  Administration
building,  located  immediately  behind our Main Office,  which will allow us to
continue to grow our Lending activities. When that building is finished, we plan
to begin  remodeling our Main Office in order to continue to serve our customers
in the most efficient and convenient manner.

We are also very pleased to offer our  stockholders  the opportunity to reinvest
dividends automatically on the Company's common stock, through the FFLC Bancorp,
Inc. Dividend  Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan").  That Plan, which was established
in January 2000, allows registered  stockholders of at least 50 shares of common
stock to reinvest  regular  dividends  on all or a portion of their common stock
into additional shares. The Plan also allows  participants to make optional cash
purchases of common stock, and all costs, including brokerage  commissions,  are
paid by the  Company.  A booklet  describing  the Plan in detail  was  mailed to
stockholders  in January.  If you would like a copy of that booklet,  there is a
reply card included in this Annual Report that you can complete and return.

In spite of the success we enjoyed this year,  the  performance of the Company's
stock did not reflect our  profitability  and growth.  Perhaps because of all of
the attention directed toward the Y2K transition, or toward "technology" stocks,
or the uncertainty  the market has felt toward future interest rates,  financial
stocks - including the Company's - were at best  neglected by the market.  While
we wish the market would fully  credit us with the success we are  experiencing,
we remain  convinced that our best strategy for creating  long-term value to our
stockholders is to focus on profitability and excellence in customer service. We
truly appreciate the loyalty and support of our stockholders, our customers, and
our  employees.  We  remain  committed  to  doing  what we can to  increase  the
long-term value of our Company.  That commitment  includes meeting our customers
needs,  the  investment  needs  of  our  stockholders,  and  the  needs  of  the
communities  in which we have the  privilege to serve.  We believe FFLC Bancorp,
Inc.  is well  positioned  to meet  those  needs,  and we  look  forward  to the
opportunities before us.

Cordially yours,



Stephen T. Kurtz
President and Chief Executive Officer

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

First Federal Savings Bank of Lake County, the subsidiary of FFLC, was organized
in 1934 as a federally chartered savings and loan association and converted to a
federally  chartered stock savings bank on January 4, 1994. The Bank's principal
business  continues to be attracting retail deposits from the general public and
investing  those  deposits,  together  with  principal  repayments  on loans and
investments  and funds  generated from  operations,  primarily in mortgage loans
secured  by   one-to-four-family,   owner-occupied   homes,   commercial  loans,
securities  and, to a lesser  extent,  construction  loans,  consumer  and other
loans, and multi-family  residential mortgage loans. In addition, the Bank holds
investments  permitted  by federal  laws and  regulations  including  securities
issued by the U.S.  Government  and agencies  thereof.  The Bank's  revenues are
derived  principally  from interest on its loan and  mortgage-backed  securities
portfolios and interest and dividends on its investment securities.

The Bank is a  community-oriented  savings  institution  offering  a variety  of
financial  services to meet the needs of the  communities it serves.  The Bank's
deposit  gathering  and  lending  markets  are  primarily  concentrated  in  the
communities  surrounding its full service  offices  located in Lake,  Sumter and
Citrus  counties in central  Florida.  Management  believes that its offices are
located in communities  that generally can be characterized as rural service and
retirement communities with residential neighborhoods comprised predominately of
one-to-four-family   residences.  The  Bank  is  the  largest  (by  asset  size)
locally-based  financial  institution in Lake County, and serves its market area
with a wide selection of residential  mortgage loans and other retail  financial
services.  Management considers the Bank's reputation for financial strength and
customer  service as a major advantage in attracting and retaining  customers in
its market area and believes it benefits from its community  orientation as well
as its established deposit base and level of core deposits.

The Company had net income of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999,
compared to net income of $4.4 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998. At
December 31, 1999, the Bank had total assets of $590.4  million,  an increase of
27.3% over total assets of $463.8  million at December 31, 1998.  That  increase
resulted  primarily  from an $112.0  million,  or 28.8%,  increase  in net loans
receivable  from  $389.1  million  at  December  31,  1998 to $501.1  million at
December  31,  1999,  reflecting  increased  local  loan  demand.  Cash and cash
equivalents  increased  $11.4  million  or 49.8%  from  $22.9  million  to $34.3
million.  Securities  decreased  $3.5  million  or 8.7%  during  1999.  Deposits
increased $78.2 million,  or 22.3%,  from $351.1 million at December 31, 1998 to
$429.3  million at December 31, 1999.  Advances  from the Federal Home Loan Bank
increased $43.0 million, while other borrowed funds increased $3.1 million for a
net  increase  of $46.1  million or 81.2% in  borrowings.  Stockholders'  equity
increased $2.4 million.

REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

General

The operating  results of the Bank are affected by Federal laws and  regulations
and the Bank is subject to extensive regulation,  examination and supervision by
the Office of Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS"),  as its chartering  agency,  and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), as the deposit insurer. The Bank
is a member of the  Federal  Home  Loan Bank  ("FHLB")  System  and its  deposit
accounts  are  insured  up to  applicable  limits  by the  FDIC  under  the SAIF
("Savings  Association Insurance Fund"). The Bank must file reports with the OTS
and the FDIC  concerning its  activities and financial  condition in addition to
obtaining  regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such
as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial  institutions.  The OTS and
the FDIC  conduct  periodic  examinations  to test the  Bank's  compliance  with
various regulatory requirements.  The activities of the Company and the Bank are
governed by the Home Owner's Loan Act, as amended (the "HOLA"),  and, in certain
respects,  the Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Act (the  "FDIA").  A more  complete
description of the HOLA and FDIA is included in the Form 10-K.

Capital Requirements

The OTS capital regulations  require savings  institutions to meet three capital
standards: a 1.5% tangible capital standard; a 3% leverage (core capital) ratio;
and an 8% risk-based  capital  standard.  Under the OTS final rule  implementing
FDICIA,  generally, a well-capitalized  institution is defined as one that meets
the following capital standards:  a 5% tangible capital standard;  a 6% leverage
(core capital) ratio; and a 10% risk-based  capital  standard,  and has not been
notified by its federal banking agency that it is in a "troubled  condition." At
December 31,  1999,  the Bank met each of its capital  requirements  and met the
criteria of a "well-capitalized" institution as defined above.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit
insurance  premiums  according to the level of risk involved in an institution's
activities. An institution's risk category is based upon whether the institution
is  classified as "well  capitalized,"  "adequately  capitalized"  or "less than
adequately  capitalized" and one of three supervisory  subcategories within each
capital group.  The supervisory  subgroup to which an institution is assigned is
based on a supervisory  evaluation and information  which the FDIC determines to
be relevant to the institution's  financial  condition and the risk posed to the
deposit  insurance fund.  Effective January 1, 1997, the FDIC lowered the annual
assessment  rates  for  SAIF  members  to 0 to 27  basis  points.  The  FDIC has
authority to raise  premiums if deemed  necessary.  If such action is taken,  it
could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the institution.

Under the FDIA,  insurance  of  deposits  may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a
finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound  practices,  is in
an unsafe or unsound  condition  to  continue  operations  or has  violated  any
applicable law, regulation,  rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the
OTS.  The  management  of the Bank does not know of any  practice,  condition or
violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
<PAGE>
CREDIT RISK

The Bank's primary business is lending on residential  real estate,  an activity
with the inherent  risk of  generating  potential  loan losses the  magnitude of
which depend on a variety of factors  affecting  borrowers  which are beyond the
control of the Bank.  The Bank has  underwriting  guidelines  and credit  review
procedures designed to minimize such credit losses.

                                       9
<PAGE>
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The  Company's  results of operations  are  dependent  primarily on net interest
income,   which  is  the   difference   between   the   income   earned  on  its
interest-earning  assets,  primarily its loans,  mortgage-backed  securities and
investment  securities,  and its  interest-bearing  liabilities,  consisting  of
deposits  and  borrowings.  The  operating  expenses of the Company  principally
consist of employee compensation,  occupancy expenses, federal deposit insurance
premiums and other general and administrative expenses. The Company's results of
operations are also  significantly  affected by general economic and competitive
conditions,  particularly changes in market interest rates,  government policies
and actions of regulatory authorities.

Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning
assets and expense on interest-bearing  liabilities. Net interest income depends
upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing  liabilities and
the interest rates earned or paid on them.

                                       10
<PAGE>
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding
(i) the total dollar amount of interest and dividend  income of the Company from
interest-earning  assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar
amount of interest  expense on  interest-bearing  liabilities  and the resultant
average costs; (iii) net  interest/dividend  income; (iv) interest-rate  spread;
(v) net interest margin;  and (vi) weighted average yields and rates at December
31,  1999.  Yields and costs were  derived by dividing  income or expense by the
average balance of assets or liabilities,  respectively,  for the periods shown.
The average balance of loans receivable  includes loans on which the Company has
discontinued  accruing  interest.  The yields and costs  include  fees which are
considered to constitute adjustments to yields.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES

The Bank is required to maintain  minimum  levels of liquid assets as defined by
OTS regulations.  That  requirement,  which varies  periodically  depending upon
economic  conditions and deposit  flows,  is based upon a percentage of deposits
and  short-term  borrowings.   The  current  required  ratio  is  4%.  The  Bank
historically has maintained a level of liquid assets in excess of the regulatory
requirement.  Liquid assets  consist of cash,  cash  equivalents  and short- and
intermediate-term   U.S.  Government  and  government  agency  securities.   The
maintenance  of liquid assets allows for the  possibility  of  disintermediation
when interest rates  fluctuate.  The Bank's liquidity ratios were 18.7% and 8.8%
at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, respectively.

The Bank's  sources of funds include  proceeds from payments and  prepayments on
mortgage loans and mortgage-backed  securities,  proceeds from the maturities of
investment securities and deposits.  While maturities and scheduled amortization
of loans and investment  securities are  predictable  sources of funds,  deposit
inflows and mortgage  prepayments  are greatly  influenced by local  conditions,
general interest rates, and regulatory changes.

At December 31, 1999,  the Bank had  outstanding  commitments  to originate $7.8
million of loans,  to fund unused lines of credit of $33.6 million,  to fund the
undisbursed  portion  of loans in process of $15.9  million  and $.7  million in
outstanding  standby  letters of  credit.  The Bank  believes  that it will have
sufficient  funds  available  to meet its  commitments.  At December  31,  1999,
certificates  of  deposit  which  were  scheduled  to mature in one year or less
totaled $205.6 million.  Management believes,  based on past experience,  that a
significant portion of these funds will remain with the Bank.

REGULATORY  CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS

As a federally-chartered financial institution, the Bank is required to maintain
certain  minimum  amounts of  regulatory  capital.  Regulatory  capital is not a
valuation  allowance and has not been created by charges against  earnings.  The
following  table  provides a summary  of the  capital  requirements,  the Bank's
regulatory capital and the amounts in excess at December 31, 1999:

MARKET RISK

Market  risk is the risk of loss from  changes in market  prices and rates.  The
Company"s market risk arises primarily from  interest-rate  risk inherent in its
lending and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors
and manages its  interest-rate  risk  exposure.  The  measurement of market risk
associated  with financial  instruments is meaningful  only when all related and
offsetting  on-  and  off-balance-sheet  transactions  are  aggregated,  and the
resulting  net  positions are  identified.  Disclosures  about the fair value of
financial instruments,  which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company"s  primary objective in managing  interest-rate  risk is to minimize
the  adverse  impact of changes  in  interest  rates on the Bank"s net  interest
income and capital, while adjusting the Company"s  asset-liability  structure to
obtain the maximum  yield-cost  spread on that  structure.  The  Company  relies
primarily  on its  asset-liability  management  to control  interest-rate  risk.
However,  a sudden and  substantial  increase  in interest  rates may  adversely
impact the Company"s  earnings,  to the extent that the interest  rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed,  to the same extent,  or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

ASSET /LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

The Bank's primary  mission is to provide home  ownership by offering  permanent
and  construction  residential  mortgage  loans and  consumer  financing  and by
providing  conveniently located depository facilities with transaction,  savings
and   certificate   accounts.   The  Bank's   goal  is  to   continue  to  be  a
well-capitalized   and  profitable  operation  that  provides  service  that  is
professional, efficient and courteous. The Bank seeks to fulfill its mission and
accomplish  its goals by pursuing  the  following  strategies:  (i)  emphasizing
lending in the one-to-four-family  residential mortgage market; (ii) controlling
interest-rate  risk;  (iii)  managing  deposit  pricing and asset  growth;  (iv)
emphasizing  cost  control;  and (v)  maintaining  asset quality by investing in
mortgage-backed  securities which, in management's  judgment,  provide a balance
between  yield  and  safety  in  a  home  mortgage  related  investment.  It  is
management's   intention  to  continue  to  employ  these  strategies  over  the
foreseeable future.

The Bank's profitability, like that of most financial institutions, is dependent
to a large extent upon its net interest income,  which is the difference between
its interest income on interest-earning  assets, such as loans,  mortgage-backed
securities   and   investment   securities,   and  its   interest   expense   on
interest-bearing liabilities,  such as deposits and other borrowings.  Financial
institutions  continue to be  affected by general  changes in levels of interest
rates and other economic factors beyond their control. At December 31, 1999, the
Bank's one-year interest  sensitivity gap (the difference  between the amount of
interest-earning assets anticipated by the Bank, to mature or reprice within one
year and the amount of interest-bearing  liabilities anticipated by the Bank, to
mature  or  reprice  within  one year) as a  percentage  of total  assets  was a
negative 2.98%. Generally, an institution with a negative gap would experience a
decrease  in net  interest  income in a period of  rising  interest  rates or an
increase  in net  interest  income  in a period  of  declining  interest  rates.
However, certain shortcomings are inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented
above.  For example,  although  certain assets and  liabilities may have similar
maturities  or  periods to  repricing,  they may react in  different  manners to
changes in market interest rates.  Therefore, no assurance can be given that the
Bank will be able to maintain its net  interest-rate  spread as market  interest
rates fluctuate.

The Bank monitors its interest-rate risk through the  Asset/Liability  Committee
which meets weekly and reports the results of such  monitoring  quarterly to the
Board of Directors.  The Bank's policy is to seek to maintain a balance  between
interest-earning  assets  and  interest-bearing  liabilities  so that the Bank's
cumulative  one-year  gap ratio is within a range which  management  believes is
conducive to maintaining  profitability  without  incurring undue risk. The Bank
has  increased  its  investment  in  adjustable-rate  and shorter  average life,
fixed-rate  mortgage-related  securities in order to position itself against the
consequences of rising interest rates.  The Bank also maintains liquid assets in
excess  of  the  regulatory   requirement,   allowing  for  the  possibility  of
disintermediation  when interest rates fluctuate.  The Bank's liquidity ratio of
18.7%  at  December  31,  1999  is  significantly  higher  than  the  regulatory
requirement  of 4% due in part to the  preparation  of the  Company  for Y2K. In
addition,  the  Bank's  large  stable  core  deposit  base  resulting  from  its
continuing  commitment to quality customer service has historically  provided it
with a steady source of funds.

         COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 TO DECEMBER 31, 1998

         General Operating  Results.  Net income for the year ended December 31,
            1999, was $5.4 million or $1.52 per basic income per share, compared
            to net income for the year ended  December  31, 1998 of $4.4 million
            or $1.22 per basic income per share.  The increase in net income was
            primarily  the result of an increase of $2.5 million in net interest
            income before  provision for loan losses for 1999,  partially offset
            by an increase of $1.9 million in noninterest expenses in 1999.

         Interest Income. Interest income increased $6.4 million, or 20.0%, from
            $32.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 to $38.6 million
            for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The increase was due to an
            increase in the average  balance of total  interest-earning  assets,
            primarily loans, from $404.1 million for the year ended December 31,
            1998 to $499.6  million for the year ended  December  31,  1999,  an
            increase of $95.5 million, or 23.6%,  partially offset by a decrease
            in the average yield on  interest-earning  assets from 7.96% for the
            year ended  December  31, 1998 to 7.73% for the year ended  December
            31, 1999.  The average yield on loans  decreased  from 8.27% for the
            year ended  December  31, 1998 to 7.99% for the year ended  December
            31, 1999.  The average yield on securities  decreased from 6.32% for
            the  year  ended  December  31,  1998 to 5.83%  for the  year  ended
            December  31,  1999.  The average  yield on other  interest  earning
            assets  decreased from 5.82% for the year ended December 31, 1998 to
            5.59% for the year ended December 31, 1999.

         Interest Expense.  Interest  expense  increased $3.9 million from $17.3
            million at December 31, 1998 to $21.2  million at December 31, 1999.
            The  increase  was due to a $97.7  million or 27.6%  increase in the
            average balance of total  interest-bearing  liabilities  from $353.7
            million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 to $451.4  million for
            the year ended December 31, 1999 offset in part by a decrease in the
            weighted-average  rate  paid on  interest-bearing  liabilities  from
            4.88% during 1998 to 4.70% in 1999.

         Provision  for Loan  Losses.  The  Bank's  provision  for  loan  losses
            increased  from  $682,000  for the year ended  December  31, 1998 to
            $719,000  for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The  increase of
            $37,000  reflects the Bank's  continuing  policy of  evaluating  the
            adequacy of its allowance for loan losses and  prevailing  standards
            within the thrift  industry.  Generally,  such  evaluation  includes
            consideration of the level of nonperforming  loans and the level and
            composition of the Bank's loan portfolio.

         Noninterest Income.  Noninterest income increased from $1.3 million for
            the year ended  December 31, 1998 to $2.3 million for the year ended
            December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily due to a $886,000 gain
            recognized in 1999 from the sale of real estate held for development
            and a $117,000 increase in other service charges and fees.

         Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense consists primarily of salaries
            and employee  benefits and occupancy  expense.  Noninterest  expense
            increased $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared
            to 1998.  The increase was primarily  due to a $998,000  increase in
            salaries and employee  benefits and a $459,000 increase in occupancy
            expense resulting from the growth of the Company.
<PAGE>
         Provision for Income Taxes.  The provision for federal and state income
            taxes  increased  from $2.6 million for the year ended  December 31,
            1998 to $3.3  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The
            effective tax rate  increased from 37.5% for the year ended December
            31, 1998 to 37.9% for the year ended December 31, 1999.

         COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 TO DECEMBER 31, 1997

         General Operating  Results.  Net income for the year ended December 31,
            1998, was $4.4 million or $1.22 per basic income per share, compared
            to net income for the year ended  December  31, 1997 of $3.8 million
            or $1.01 per basic income per share.  The increase in net income was
            primarily  the result of an increase of $2.2 million in net interest
            income before provision for loan losses for 1998.

         Interest Income.  Interest income increased $4.0 million,  or 14%, from
            $28.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 to $32.2 million
            for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  The increase was due to an
            increase in the average  balance of total  interest-earning  assets,
            primarily loans, from $361.1 million for the year ended December 31,
            1997 to $404.1  million for the year ended  December  31,  1998,  an
            increase of $43 million, or 12% and an increase in the average yield
            on  interest-earning  assets from 7.80% for the year ended  December
            31, 1997 to 7.96% for the year ended  December 31, 1998. The average
            yield on loans  decreased from 8.31% for the year ended December 31,
            1997 to 8.27% for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  The  average
            yield on securities decreased from 6.35% for the year ended December
            31, 1997 to 6.32% for the year ended  December 31, 1998. The average
            yield on other interest  earning assets decreased from 5.88% for the
            year ended  December  31, 1997 to 5.82% for the year ended  December
            31, 1998.

         Interest Expense.  Interest  expense  increased $1.9 million from $15.4
            million at December 31, 1997 to $17.3  million at December 31, 1998.
            The  increase  was due to a $41.7  million  or 13%  increase  in the
            average balance of total  interest-bearing  liabilities  from $311.9
            million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 to $353.6  million for
            the year ended December 31, 1998 offset in part by a decrease in the
            weighted-average  rate  paid on  interest-bearing  liabilities  from
            4.94% during 1997 to 4.88% in 1998.

         Provision  for Loan  Losses.  The  Bank's  provision  for  loan  losses
            increased  from  $649,000  for the year ended  December  31, 1997 to
            $682,000  for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  The  increase of
            $33,000  reflects the Bank's  continuing  policy of  evaluating  the
            adequacy of its allowance for loan losses and  prevailing  standards
            within the thrift  industry.  Generally,  such  evaluation  includes
            consideration of the level of nonperforming  loans and the level and
            composition of the Bank's loan portfolio.

         Noninterest Income.  Noninterest income increased from $1.2 million for
            the year ended  December 31, 1997 to $1.3 million for the year ended
            December  31, 1998.  The increase was due to a $258,000  increase in
            other  service  charges  and fees and a $73,000  increase in deposit
            account fees, which was partially  offset by a $302,000  decrease in
            gain on sale of other assets.

         Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense consists primarily of salaries
            and employee  benefits and occupancy  expense.  Noninterest  expense
            increased  $973,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to
            1997.  This  increase was  primarily  due to a $544,000  increase in
            salaries and employee  benefits and a $130,000 increase in occupancy
            expense, caused by growth of the Company.

         Provision for Income Taxes.  The provision for federal and state income
            taxes  increased  from $2.1 million for the year ended  December 31,
            1997 to $2.6  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  The
            effective tax rate  increased from 35.7% for the year ended December
            31, 1997 to 37.5% for the year ended December 31, 1998.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Consolidated  Financial  Statements and Notes thereto  presented herein have
been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP,  which  requires  the  measurement  of
financial  position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering the changes in the relative  purchasing power of money over time due
to inflation.  The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the
Bank's operations.  Unlike most industrial companies,  nearly all the assets and
liabilities of the Bank are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have
a greater impact on the Bank's performance than do the effects of general levels
of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to
the same extent as the price of goods and services.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
    FFLCBancorp,  Inc. (the "Holding  Company") was  incorporated in Delaware on
        September  16, 1993,  and acquired  First  Federal  Savings Bank of Lake
        County (the "Bank") in  connection  with the Bank's  conversion to stock
        form on January  4,  1994.  The  Holding  Company is a savings  and loan
        holding   company   subject  to  regulation  by  the  Office  of  Thrift
        Supervision ("OTS") which transacts its business through its subsidiary,
        the Bank. The Bank is a  community-oriented  savings  institution  which
        offers a variety of financial  services to  individuals  and  businesses
        primarily  located in Lake  County,  Sumter  County  and Citrus  County,
        Florida.  The  deposits of the Bank are  insured by the Federal  Deposit
        Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") through the Savings Association Insurance
        Fund ("SAIF").

    Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated  financial statements include
        the  accounts  of  the  Holding  Company,   the  Bank,  and  the  Bank's
        wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Lake County Service Corporation (the "Service
        Corporation").  All significant  intercompany  transactions and balances
        have been eliminated in consolidation.

    General. The accounting and reporting policies of FFLC Bancorp, Inc. and its
        subsidiaries  (together,  the "Company")  conform to generally  accepted
        accounting  principles  and  to  general  practices  within  the  thrift
        industry.  All per share  amounts  presented  reflect  the effect of the
        five-for-three  stock split in November,  1997. The following summarizes
        the significant accounting policies of the Company:

    Use of  Estimates.   In  preparing   consolidated  financial  statements  in
        conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,  management is
        required to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the  reported
        amounts of assets and  liabilities  as of the date of the balance  sheet
        and  reported  amounts of revenues  and  expenses  during the  reporting
        period.  Actual  results  could  differ from those  estimates.  Material
        estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the
        near term relate to the  determination  of the allowance for loan losses
        and foreclosed real estate.

    Cash and Cash Equivalents.  For purposes of the  consolidated  statements of
        cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances due from
        banks and interest-bearing deposits.

        The Bank is  required  to  maintain  certain  average  reserve  balances
        pursuant to  regulations of the Federal  Reserve  Board.  These balances
        must be  maintained  in the form of vault  cash or  noninterest  bearing
        deposits at a Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank exceeded this  requirement,
        which was $2.9  million and $1.1  million at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
        respectively.

    Securities. The Company may classify its securities as either trading,  held
        to  maturity  or  available  for  sale.   Trading  securities  are  held
        principally  for resale and  recorded at their fair  values.  Unrealized
        gains and losses on  trading  securities  are  included  immediately  in
        earnings.  Held-to-maturity  securities  are those which the Company has
        the positive  intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at
        amortized cost.  Available-for-sale securities consist of securities not
        classified as trading  securities  nor as  held-to-maturity  securities.
        Unrealized holding gains and losses,  net of tax, on  available-for-sale
        securities are excluded from income and reported in other  comprehensive
        income.  Gains and losses on the sale of  available-for-sale  securities
        are   recorded   on  the   trade   date   and   determined   using   the
        specific-identification  method.  Premiums and  discounts on  securities
        available  for sale and held to  maturity  are  recognized  in  interest
        income using the interest method over the period to maturity.


                                       26

    Loans  Receivable.  Loans  receivable  that  management  has the  intent and
        ability to hold for the foreseeable  future or until maturity or pay-off
        are   reported  at  their   outstanding   principal   adjusted  for  any
        charge-offs,  the  allowance  for loan losses,  and any deferred fees or
        costs on originated loans.

        Loan  origination  fees  and  certain  direct   origination   costs  are
        capitalized  and recognized as an adjustment of the yield of the related
        loan.

        The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is
        90 days delinquent  unless the credit is well-secured  and in process of
        collection.  In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off
        at an earlier date if  collection of principal or interest is considered
        doubtful.

        All  interest  accrued  but not  collected  for loans that are placed on
        nonaccrual or  charged-off  is reversed  against  interest  income.  The
        interest  on  these  loans  is  accounted  for  on  the   cash-basis  or
        cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual.  Loans are
        returned to accrual  status when all the principal and interest  amounts
        contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably
        assured.

    Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses is  established as
        losses are  estimated  to have  occurred  through a  provision  for loan
        losses  charged  to  earnings.  Loan  losses  are  charged  against  the
        allowance  when  management  believes  the  uncollectibility  of a  loan
        balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the
        allowance.

        The  allowance  for loan  losses  is  evaluated  on a  regular  basis by
        management  and  is  based  upon  management's  periodic  review  of the
        collectibility  of the  loans  in light of  historical  experience,  the
        nature and volume of the loan  portfolio,  adverse  situations  that may
        affect  the  borrower's  ability  to  repay,   estimated  value  of  any
        underlying   collateral  and  prevailing   economic   conditions.   This
        evaluation is inherently  subjective as it requires  estimates  that are
        susceptible  to  significant   revision  as  more  information   becomes
        available.

        A loan is considered  impaired when,  based on current  information  and
        events,  it is probable  that the Company  will be unable to collect the
        scheduled  payments of principal or interest  when due  according to the
        contractual  terms  of  the  loan  agreement.   Factors   considered  by
        management in determining impairment include payment status,  collateral
        value,  and  the  probability  of  collecting  scheduled  principal  and
        interest payments when due. Loans that experience  insignificant payment
        delays and payment shortfalls  generally are not classified as impaired.
        Management  determines  the  significance  of payment delays and payment
        shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the
        circumstances  surroundings  the loan and the  borrower,  including  the
        length of the delay,  the reasons for the delay,  the  borrower's  prior
        payment  record,  and the amount of the  shortfall  in  relation  to the
<PAGE>
        principal  and interest  owed.  Impairment is measured on a loan by loan
        basis for  commercial  loans by either  the  present  value of  expected
        future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective  interest rate, the
        loan's  obtainable  market price, or the fair value of the collateral if
        the loan is collateral dependent.

        Large  groups of  smaller  balance  homogeneous  loans are  collectively
        evaluated for impairment.  Accordingly,  the Company does not separately
        identify  individual  consumer  and  residential  loans  for  impairment
        disclosures.

    Foreclosed Real Estate.  Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu
        of, loan  foreclosure are to be sold and are initially  recorded at fair
        value at the date of foreclosure  establishing  a new cost basis.  After
        foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the
        real  estate is  carried at the lower of  carrying  amount or fair value
        less cost to sell.  Revenue and expenses from  operations and changes in
        the valuation  allowance are included in the consolidated  statements of
        income.


                                       27

    Premises and  Equipment.  Land is carried at cost.  The Company's  premises,
        furniture and equipment and leasehold  improvements are carried at cost,
        less  accumulated  depreciation and  amortization  computed  principally
        using the straight-line method.

    Transfer of Financial  Assets.  Transfers of financial  assets are accounted
        for as sales, when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control
        over transferred  assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets
        have been  isolated  from the Company,  (2) the  transferee  obtains the
        right (free of  conditions  that  constrain it from taking  advantage of
        that right) to pledge or exchange the  transferred  assets,  and (3) the
        Company does not maintain  effective control over the transferred assets
        through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.

    Income Taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined  using the
        liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred
        tax asset or  liability  is  determined  based on the tax effects of the
        temporary  differences  between  the book and tax  bases of the  various
        balance sheet assets and  liabilities  and gives current  recognition to
        changes in tax rates and laws.

    Stock Compensation Plans. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
        No.  123,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,   encourages  all
        entities to adopt a fair value based method of  accounting  for employee
        stock compensation plans,  whereby  compensation cost is measured at the
        grant  date based on the value of the award and is  recognized  over the
        service period,  which is usually the vesting period.  However,  it also
        allows an entity to  continue  to  measure  compensation  cost for those
        plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by
        Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
        to Employees,  whereby  compensation  cost is the excess, if any, of the
        quoted market price of the stock at the grant date (or other measurement
        date) over the amount an employee  must pay to acquire the stock.  Stock
        options  issued under the Company's  stock option plan have no intrinsic
        value at the grant date, and under Opinion No. 25 no  compensation  cost
        is  recognized  for them.  The Company has elected to continue  with the
        accounting  methodology in Opinion No. 25 and, as a result, has provided
        proforma  disclosures  of net  income  and  income  per  share and other
        disclosures,  as if the fair value based method of  accounting  had been
        applied. (See Note 16).

    Off-Balance  Sheet  Instruments.  In the ordinary  course of  business,  the
        Company has entered into  off-balance-sheet  instruments  consisting  of
        commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit,  undisbursed loans
        in process and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are
        recorded in the financial statements when they are funded.

    Fair Values of  Financial  Instruments.   The  fair  value  of  a  financial
        instrument is the current amount that would be exchanged between willing
        parties,  other  than  in a  forced  liquidation.  Fair  value  is  best
        determined based upon quoted market prices.  However, in many instances,
        there are no quoted market prices for the  Company's  various  financial
        instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair
        values are based on estimates  using  present  value or other  valuation
        techniques.   Those  techniques  are   significantly   affected  by  the
        assumptions  used,  including  the discount rate and estimates of future
<PAGE>
        cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in
        an immediate  settlement of the  instrument.  SFAS 107 excludes  certain
        financial   instruments  and  all  nonfinancial   instruments  from  its
        disclosure requirements.  Accordingly,  the aggregate fair value amounts
        presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the
        Company.  The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company
        in estimating fair values of financial instruments:

        Cash and Cash  Equivalents.  The carrying amounts of cash and short-term
        instruments approximate their fair value.

        Securities.  Fair values for  securities  held to maturity and available
        for sale are based on quoted market prices,  where available.  If quoted
        market prices are not available,  fair values are based on quoted market
        prices of  comparable  instruments.  The carrying  value of Federal Home
        Loan Bank stock approximates fair value.

                                       28
<PAGE>
        Loans Receivable.  For variable-rate  loans that reprice  frequently and
        have no  significant  change in credit  risk,  fair  values are based on
        carrying  values.  Fair values for  certain  fixed-rate  mortgage  (e.g.
        one-to-four family  residential),  commercial real estate and commercial
        loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses,  using interest
        rates  currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers
        of similar credit quality.

        Deposit  Liabilities.  The fair values disclosed for demand,  NOW, money
        market and  savings  deposits  are, by  definition,  equal to the amount
        payable  on demand  at the  reporting  date  (that  is,  their  carrying
        amounts).  Fair  values  for  fixed-rate  certificates  of  deposit  are
        estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest
        rates   currently  being  offered  on  certificates  to  a  schedule  of
        aggregated expected monthly maturities of time deposits.

        Borrowed  Funds.  The carrying  amounts of borrowings  under  repurchase
        agreements  approximate  their fair values.  Fair values of Federal Home
        Loan Bank advances are  estimated  using  discounted  cash flow analysis
        based on the Company's current  incremental  borrowing rates for similar
        types of borrowing arrangements.

        Accrued Interest.  The carrying amounts of accrued interest  approximate
        their fair values.

        Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments. Fair values for off-balance-sheet lending
        commitments  are based on fees  currently  charged to enter into similar
        agreements,  taking into account the remaining  terms of the  agreements
        and the counterparties' credit standing.

    Income Per Share of Common  Stock.  During  1997,  the  Company  adopted the
        provisions  of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 128,  "Earnings Per
        Share" (SFAS No. 128).  SFAS No. 128 provides  accounting  and reporting
        standards for calculating  earnings per share. Basic income per share of
        common  stock has been  computed by dividing the net income for the year
        by the weighted-average  number of shares outstanding.  Shares of common
        stock  purchased  by the  Employee  Stock  Option Plan  ("ESOP") and the
        Retention and Recognition Plan ("RRP") incentive plans (see Note 16) are
        only considered outstanding when the shares are released or committed to
        be released for allocation to participants. The ESOP initially purchased
        368,242  shares,  of which 4,383 shares were released for  allocation to
        participants  each month  beginning in January,  1994. The RRP initially
        purchased  184,122  shares,  of which 179,541,  179,541 and 179,373 were
        allocated to participants  and are considered  outstanding for the years
        ended December 31, 1997,  1998 and 1999,  respectively.  At December 31,
        1999,  57,355  shares  remain  uncommitted  under both plans and are not
        considered outstanding for purposes of the computation of net income per
        share of common stock.  Diluted income per share is computed by dividing
        net  income  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  outstanding
        including  the dilutive  effect of stock  options (see Note 16) computed
        using  the  treasury  stock  method  prescribed  by SFAS  No.  128.  The
        following  table  presents  the  calculation  of net income per share of
        common stock:

    Securities  with a carrying  value of  approximately  $4.0  million and $2.9
        million at December  31, 1999 and 1998,  respectively,  were  pledged to
        secure  public  funds and tax  deposits.  The Company  has also  pledged
        securities  with a carrying value of $7.9 million for  borrowings  under
        retail  repurchase  agreements  with customers at December 31, 1999 (See
        Note 6).

    There were no sales of securities  during the years ended  December 31, 1999
        or 1998.  In  1997,  the  Company  realized  gross  gains on the sale of
        securities available for sale of $11,000.

    The Company's portfolio of mortgage-backed securities include collateralized
        mortgage  obligations  (CMOs).  CMOs are generally divided into tranches
        whereby  principal  repayments  from the  underlying  mortgages are used
        sequentially  to retire the securities  according to the priority of the
        tranches. The Company invests in the following  collateralized  mortgage
        obligation tranches:  sequential,  planned amortization class,  targeted
        amortization class or support or companion  floating-rate tranches. Such
        tranches  have  stated  maturities  ranging  from 1-22  years;  however,
        because of  prepayments,  the  expected  weighted-average  life of these
        securities at December 31, 1999 is approximately 2.8 years. The majority
        of the CMOs  owned by the  Company  are  insured or  guaranteed,  either
        directly or indirectly,  through  mortgage-backed  securities underlying
        the  obligations  by either the FNMA,  FHLMC or GNMA.  Depending  on the
        amount of the Company's  available-for-sale  mortgage-backed securities,
        fluctuations  in the interest rate  environment  and other factors,  the
        Company may experience  material effects on its capital resources due to
        categorizing  these securities as available for sale. The Company's CMOs
        may be subject to price movements which typically result from prepayment
        on the underlying  obligations.  The Company's CMOs of $2.3 million have
        coupon rates ranging from 6.09% to 7.00% and had a weighted-average rate
        of 6.54% at December 31, 1999. The Company  purchases only CMOs rated AA
        or better by nationally recognized rating services.

    The Company  adopted  FAS 133  effective  July 1,  1999.  As allowed by this
        standard,  the Company reclassified all securities held to maturity with
        a book  value of  $14,784,000  and a  market  value  of  $14,969,000  to
        available for sale on July 1, 1999.

    The Company  originates or purchases  nonresidential  real  property  loans.
        These loans are considered by management to be of somewhat  greater risk
        of uncollectibility due to the dependency on income production or future
        development  of the  real  estate.  Nearly  all of  the  Company's  real
        property loans were  collateralized by real property in Lake, Sumter and
        Citrus Counties, Florida.
<PAGE>
    Nonaccrual  loans at  December  31,  1999 and 1998  totaled  $2,362,000  and
        $444,000,  respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 1999, interest
        income on loans would have been increased  approximately  $99,000 if the
        interest  on  nonaccrual  loans at December  31, 1999 had been  recorded
        under the original terms of such loans.

    Loans serviced for others, consisting solely of participations sold, are not
        included in the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets.  The unpaid
        principal  balances of these  loans were  approximately  $1,040,000  and
        $930,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

    The security  agreement with FHLB includes a blanket floating lien requiring
        the Bank to maintain first  mortgage  loans as pledged  collateral in an
        amount equal to at least, when discounted at 75% of the unpaid principal
        balances,  100% of these  advances.  The FHLB  stock is also  pledged as
        collateral  for these  advances.  At December 31,  1999,  the Bank could
        borrow up to $148.7 million under the FHLB security agreement.

    Other borrowed  funds were  composed of retail  repurchase  agreements  with
        customers.  The Company enters into retail  repurchase  agreements  with
        customers in which the funds received are accounted for as borrowings to
        the Company.  The total amount  outstanding  under these  agreements  at
        December 31, 1999 and 1998 were $3.9 million and $789,000, respectively.
        The Company has pledged securities with a carrying value of $7.9 million

    Retained  earnings at  December  31,  1999 and 1998  includes  approximately
        $5,810,000  for which no deferred  federal income tax liability has been
        recognized.  This amount  represents an allocation of income to bad debt
        deductions for tax purposes only.  Reduction of amounts so allocated for
        purposes  other than tax bad debt  losses or  adjustments  arising  from
        carryback of net  operating  losses would create income for tax purposes
        only,  which would be subject to the then current  corporate  income tax
        rate. The unrecorded  deferred  income tax liability on the above amount
        was approximately $2,186,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998.

    The Small  Business Job  Protection  Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act") enacted on
        August 2,  1996  requires  savings  institutions,  such as the Bank,  to
        recapture certain portions of their  accumulated bad debt reserves,  and
        eliminated the Percentage of Taxable Income Method of accounting for bad
        debts for tax  purposes.  The Bank was  required to change its method of
        accounting for bad debts for tax purposes  effective January 1, 1996. In
        addition,  the Bank was required to recapture the excess of its bad debt
        reserves  at December  31, 1995 over its base year  reserves at December
        31, 1987,  ratably over a six-year period beginning in 1998. At December
        31,  1999,  the  Bank  had   approximately   $606,000  of  deferred  tax
        liabilities recorded for the recapture of its excess bad debt reserves.

(8)  Pension Plan
    The Company  has a defined  contribution  profit  sharing  401(k)  plan (the
        "401(k) Plan"). All employees who have met a minimum service requirement
        (1,000 hours of service in a twelve-month period) may participate in the
        Plan. Under the 401(k) Plan, a participant may elect to contribute up to
        15% of their annual  compensation,  subject to IRS  limitations on total
        annual contributions.  The Company will make contributions to the 401(k)
        Plan on a monthly  basis at two percent of  participants'  compensation.
        Contributions  to the 401(k) Plan for the years ended December 31, 1999,
        1998 and 1997 were $54,000, $46,000 and $37,000, respectively.

(9)  Financial Instruments
    The Company is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet risk
        in the normal  course of  business  to meet the  financing  needs of its
        customers  and to reduce its own  exposure to  fluctuations  in interest
        rates.  These  financial  instruments  are commitments to extend credit,
        unused lines of credit, undisbursed loans in process and standby letters
        of credit and may involve,  to varying  degrees,  elements of credit and
        interest-rate   risk  in  excess  of  the  amount   recognized   in  the
        consolidated  balance sheet. The contract  amounts of these  instruments
        reflect the extent of  involvement  the  Company has in these  financial
        instruments.

    The Company's  exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
        other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit
        is  represented  by the  contractual  amount of those  instruments.  The
        Company uses the same credit  policies in making  commitments as it does
        for on-balance-sheet instruments.

    Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
        there is no  violation of any  condition  established  in the  contract.
        Commitments  generally have fixed expiration dates or other  termination
        clauses and may require  payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments
        are expected to expire  without being drawn upon,  the total  commitment
        amounts do not  necessarily  represent  future  cash  requirements.  The

<PAGE>

        Company  evaluates each customer's  credit  worthiness on a case-by-case
        basis.  The amount of  collateral  obtained if deemed  necessary  by the
        Company  upon  extension  of  credit  is  based on  management's  credit
        evaluation of the counterparty.

    Standby letters of credit are conditional  commitments issued by the Company
        to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  The credit
        risk involved in issuing  letters of credit is  essentially  the same as
        that involved in extending loans to customers.

(10)  Significant Group Concentration of Credit Risk
     The Company grants real estate,  commercial and consumer loans to customers
         primarily  in the State of Florida  with the  majority of such loans in
         the Lake,  Sumter and Citrus  County  area.  Therefore,  the  Company's
         exposure  to credit  risk is  significantly  affected by changes in the
         economy of the Lake,  Sumter and Citrus County area.  In addition,  the
         Company has a concentration of single-family residential mortgage loans
         in a specific residential  retirement community of approximately $107.4
         million.

     The contractual  amounts of credit related  financial  instruments  such as
         commitments  to  extend  credit  represent  the  amounts  of  potential
         accounting  loss should the contract be fully drawn upon,  the customer
         default and the value of any existing collateral become worthless.

</TABLE>

(12)  Commitments and Contingencies
    In  the  ordinary  course of business,  the Company has various  outstanding
        commitments  and  contingent  liabilities  that are not reflected in the
        accompanying consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company
        is a  defendant  in  certain  claims  and legal  actions  arising in the
        ordinary  course  of  business.  In the  opinion  of  management,  after
        consultation  with legal  counsel,  the  ultimate  disposition  of these
        matters  is not  expected  to  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
        consolidated financial condition of the Company.

(13)  Restrictions on Retained Earnings
    The Bank is subject to certain  restrictions on the amount of dividends that
        it may declare without prior regulatory approval.  At December 31, 1999,
        approximately  $21.4  million of retained  earnings  were  available for
        dividend declaration without prior regulatory approval.

(14)  Regulatory Matters
    The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital  requirement  administered
        by the  federal  banking  agencies.  Failure  to  meet  minimum  capital
        requirements  can initiate  certain  mandatory-and  possibly  additional
        discretionary-actions  by regulators  that, if undertaken,  could have a
        direct  material  effect on the Company's  financial  statements.  Under
        capital  adequacy  guidelines  and the  regulatory  framework for prompt
        corrective  action,  the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that
        involve  quantitative  measures of the Bank's assets,  liabilities,  and
        certain   off-balance-sheet   items  as  calculated   under   regulatory
        accounting practices.  The Bank's capital amounts and classification are
        also  subject  to  qualitative   judgements  by  the  regulators   about
        components, risk weightings, and other factors.

    Quantitative  measures  established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
        require the Bank to  maintain  minimum  amounts  (set forth in the table
        below) of total and Tier I capital  (as defined in the  regulations)  to
        risk-weighted assets (as defined).  Management believes,  as of December
        31, 1999, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which
        it is subject.
<PAGE>

    As  of  December  31,  1999,  the  most  recent  notification  from  the OTS
        categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory  framework
        for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the
        Bank must maintain minimum tangible,  tier I (core), tier I (risk-based)
        and total risk-based capital ratios as set forth in the table. There are
        no conditions or events since that notification that management believes
        have changed the institution's category.

(15)  Conversion to Stock Savings Bank
    The  Bank  successfully  completed a conversion  from a federally  chartered
         mutual savings  association to a federally chartered stock savings bank
         on  January 4, 1994  pursuant  to the Plan of  Conversion.  The Plan of
         Conversion  provided for the  establishment  of a  Liquidation  Account
         equal to the retained  income of the Bank as of September 30, 1993 (the
         date of the most  recent  financial  statement  presented  in the final
         conversion  prospectus).  The  Liquidation  Account is  established  to
         provide  a  limited  priority  claim  to  the  assets  of the  Bank  to
         qualifying  depositors  as of  September  30,  1992  (Eligible  Account
         Holders)  who   continue  to  maintain   deposits  in  the  Bank  after
         conversion.  In the  unlikely  event of a complete  liquidation  of the
         Bank,  and only in such  event,  each  Eligible  Account  Holder  would
         receive from the Liquidation  Account a liquidation  distribution based
         on their  proportionate  share of the then total  remaining  qualifying
         deposits.

    Current  regulations  allow the Bank to pay dividends on its stock after the
         conversion if its regulatory capital would not thereby be reduced below
         the amount then required for the  aforementioned  Liquidation  Account.
         Also, capital distribution regulations limit the Bank's ability to make
         capital  distributions  which include dividends,  stock redemptions and
         repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible
         debt and other  transactions  charged to the capital  account  based on
         their capital level and supervisory condition. Federal regulations also
         preclude any repurchase of the stock by the Bank or its holding company
         for three years after  conversion  except for  purchases of  qualifying
         shares of a director and repurchases pursuant to an offer made on a pro
         rata basis to all stockholders and with prior approval of the Office of
         Thrift  Supervision  or pursuant  to an  open-market  stock  repurchase
         program that complies with certain regulatory  criteria.  See also Note
         18 for information regarding the Bank's Stock Repurchase Program.

(16)  Stock Benefit Plans
    The  Company  follows the  provisions  of Statement of Financial  Accounting
         Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No.
         123").  SFAS No. 123  applies  to  stock-based  compensation  under the
         Company's incentive stock option plan (the "Option Plan") and under the
         Company's Recognition and Retention Plan discussed below. As allowed by
         SFAS No. 123, the Company  elected to continue to measure  compensation
         cost for the  options or shares  granted  under  either  plan using the
         intrinsic value method of accounting  prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,
         "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS No. 123 does not apply
         to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan discussed below.

    During the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, 16,250,  18,000 and
         10,867 options were granted under the Option Plan,  and in 1997,  2,014
         shares were awarded under the  Recognition and Retention Plan. SFAS No.
         123 requires pro forma fair value  disclosures  if the intrinsic  value
         method is being  utilized.  In order to calculate the fair value of the
         options,  it was assumed that the risk-free  interest rate was 7.0% for
         each period, an annualized  dividend yield of approximately  2.0% would
         apply over the exercise period,  the expected life of the options would
         be the entire  exercise  period and the expected  stock  volatility was
         36%, 42% and 23%,  respectively,  for 1999, 1998 and 1997. For purposes
         of pro forma  disclosures,  the  estimated  fair value was  included in
         expense in the period vesting occurs. The proforma information has been
         determined  as if the Company had  accounted  for its stock options and
         share  awards  under the fair  value  method of SFAS No.  123 and is as

    Stock Option Plan. The Company has a Stock  Option Plan under which  460,303
         common shares are  authorized to be granted to directors,  officers and
         employees  of the  Bank.  Shares  granted  under  the  Option  Plan are
         exercisable  at the market price at the date of grant.  Such  incentive
         stock  options  granted to officers and employees  are  exercisable  in
         three equal annual  installments,  with the first installment  becoming
         exercisable one year from the date of grant. Options granted to outside
         directors are exercisable  immediately,  but any common shares obtained
         from exercise of the options may not be sold prior to one year from the
         date of  grant.  All  options  expire at the  earlier  of ten years for
         officers and employees or twenty years for  directors  from the date of
         grant or one  year  following  the date  which  the  outside  director,
         officer or employee  ceases to serve in such capacity.  At December 31,
         1999,  38,749  shares remain  available for grant to future  directors,
         officers and employees.

    Employee Stock  Ownership  Plan. The Company  sponsors a leveraged ESOP that
        covers eligible  employees who have a twelve-month  period of employment
        with the Bank during which they worked at least 1,000 hours and who have
        attained  age 21. The Bank  makes  quarterly  contributions  to the ESOP
        equal to the  ESOP's  debt  service.  The ESOP Trust  purchased  368,242
        shares of common stock in the Company's initial public offering with the
        proceeds  from a loan from the  Company.  This loan bears  interest at a
        fixed-rate of six percent with  principal and interest  payable in equal
        quarterly  installments over seven years. The ESOP shares initially were
        pledged as collateral  for its debt.  As the debt is repaid,  shares are
        released from collateral and allocated to active  employees based on the
        proportion  of debt service paid during the year.  The Company  accounts
        for its ESOP in accordance with Statement of Position 93-6. Accordingly,
        the debt of the  ESOP is  recorded  as debt  and the cost of the  shares
        pledged as collateral are reported as a contra equity account. As shares
        are released from collateral,  the Company records compensation expense,
        and an offsetting  credit to capital,  equal to the current market price
        of the shares,  and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share
        computations.  Dividends on all ESOP shares are recorded as compensation
        expense as it is management's  intention to allocate the dividends along
        with the shares when allocated. Compensation expense for the years ended
        December 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997  included the  following  ESOP related
        costs:

    Recognition and Retention Plan. The Company  adopted,  and the  shareholders
        approved,  an RRP for  directors,  officers and  employees to enable the
        Bank to attract and retain experienced and capable personnel. On January
        4,  1994,  the  conversion  date,  184,122  shares of common  stock were
        purchased for the RRP which  included  8,067 shares  reserved for future
        directors, officers and employees. The shares are granted in the form of
        restricted  stock  to be  earned  in  three  equal  annual  installments
        beginning  April 4, 1995.  The RRP shares  purchased  in the  conversion
        initially  were  excluded  from   stockholders'   equity.   The  Company
        recognized  compensation  expense in the amount of the fair market value
        of the common stock at the grant date of $6 per share, pro rata over the
        years  (1996,  1995 and 1994)  during  which the shares  were earned and
        payable and recorded a credit to  shareholders'  equity.  The shares are
        entitled  to all voting and other  shareholder  rights,  except that the
        shares, while restricted,  cannot be sold, pledged or otherwise disposed
        of, and are required to be held in escrow.

    If  a holder of restricted  stock under the RRP  terminated  employment  for
        reasons other than death, disability, retirement or change of control in
        the Company,  such employee  forfeits all rights to any allocated shares
        which  are  still  restricted.   If  termination  is  caused  by  death,
        disability,  retirement  or  change  in  control  of  the  Company,  all
        allocated  shares become  unrestricted.  Forfeitures  are reallocated to
        eligible  participants  annually.  At December  31,  1999,  4,749 shares
        remain reserved for future directors, officers and employees.

(20)  Year 2000 Issues
     The Company's  operating  and  financial  systems  have  been  found  to be
         compliant;  the "Y2K Problem" has not adversely  affected the Company's
         operations nor does management expect that it will.

(21)       Dividend Reinvestment Plan
     On  January 7, 2000, the Company  established a Dividend  Reinvestment Plan
         (the  "Plan").  The Plan was  approved  by the  Board of  Directors  on
         December 30, 1999 and is intended to provide  stockholders of record of
         at  least  50  shares  with  a  convenient   and   economical   way  to
         automatically  reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends and to
         invest optional cash payments,  subject to minimum and maximum purchase
         limitations,  in additional shares of common stock. Stockholders pay no
         service  charges or brokerage  commissions  for common stock  purchased
         under the Plan.

                         Independent Auditors' Report



The Board of Directors
FFLC Bancorp, Inc.
Leesburg, Florida:

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of FFLC Bancorp,
Inc. and Subsidiary (the "Company") (the parent company of First Federal Savings
Bank of  Lake  County)  as of  December  31,  1999  and  1998  and  the  related
consolidated  statements  of income,  changes in  stockholders'  equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period ended  December 31, 1999.
These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's  management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of the Company as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the results of its  operations and its cash flows
for each of the  years in the  three-year  period  ended  December  31,  1999 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
