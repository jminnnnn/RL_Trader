ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business

The registrant,  FFLC Bancorp,  Inc.  ("FFLC" or the  "Company"),  completed its
public  offering of  2,761,819  shares of its common  stock and  acquired  First
Federal  Savings Bank of Lake County ("the Savings Bank") in connection with the
Savings Bank's conversion from a federally  chartered mutual savings association
to a  federally  chartered  stock  savings  bank on  January  4,  1994.  The net
conversion proceeds totaled $26.6 million of which $13.3 million was invested in
the  Savings  Bank  and  $13.3  million  was  retained  by the  registrant.  The
registrant  loaned $2.2 million to the  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan and the
remaining  $11.1  million  has been  invested  through  the  Savings  Bank.  The
registrant,  which was  incorporated  in Delaware on September  16,  1993,  is a
savings and loan holding  company and is subject to  regulation by the Office of
Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS").  The  registrant  has not  transacted any material
business  other than through its  subsidiary,  the Savings Bank. At December 31,
1996, the Company had total assets of $346.4 million and stockholders' equity of
$53.6 million.

The Savings Bank was established in 1934 as a federally-chartered mutual savings
and loan association. The Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank
("FHLB")  System and its deposit  accounts are insured to the maximum  allowable
amount by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC").  At December 31,
1996,  the Savings  Bank had total  assets of $346.4  million and  stockholders'
equity of $41.7 million.

The principal  business of the Savings Bank is attracting  retail  deposits from
the general  public and  investing  those  deposits,  together with payments and
repayments  on loans  and  investments  and  funds  generated  from  operations,
primarily in mortgage loans secured by  one-to-four-family  owner-occupied homes
and  mortgage-backed  securities,  and, to a lesser extent,  construction loans,
consumer  and other loans,  and  multi-family  residential  mortgage  loans.  In
addition,  the Savings  Bank holds  investments  permitted  by federal  laws and
regulations  including  securities  issued by the U.S.  Government  and agencies
thereof.  The Savings Bank's revenues are derived  principally  from interest on
its mortgage loan and  mortgage-backed  securities  portfolios  and interest and
dividends on its investment securities.

Market Area and Competition

The Savings Bank is a community-oriented  savings institution offering a variety
of  financial  services  to meet the needs of the  communities  it  serves.  The
Savings Bank's deposit gathering and lending markets are primarily  concentrated
in the  communities  surrounding  its full service  offices  located in Lake and
Sumter  counties in central  Florida.  The Savings Bank's  competition for loans
comes  principally from commercial  banks,  savings  institutions,  and mortgage
banking  companies.  The Savings Bank's most direct  competition for savings has
historically come from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions.
The Savings  Bank faces  additional  competition  for savings  from money market
mutual funds and other corporate and government  securities  funds.  The Savings
Bank  also  faces  increased  competition  for  deposits  from  other  financial
intermediaries such as securities brokerage firms and insurance companies.

Lending Activities

Loan  Portfolio.  The  Savings  Bank's  loan  portfolio  consists  primarily  of
conventional first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family  residences.  At
December  31,  1996,  the Savings  Bank's  total loans  outstanding  were $236.9
million,  of which  $191.8  million or 80.95% of the Savings  Bank's  total loan
portfolio  were  one-to-four-family  residential  first mortgage  loans.  Of the
one-to-four-family  residential  mortgage loans outstanding at that date, 25.80%
were fixed rate loans and 74.20% were adjustable-rate ("ARM") loans. At the same
date,  commercial  real estate  loans and other  loans on  improved  real estate
totaled  $13.6  million,  or 5.73% of the Savings  Bank's total loan  portfolio;
construction  (excluding  construction/permanent  loans) and land loans  totaled
$5.5  million  or  2.32%  of  the  Savings  Bank's  total  loan  portfolio;  and
multi-family  mortgage loans totaled $4.2 million or 1.76% of the Savings Bank's
total loan portfolio.  Consumer and other loans held by the Savings Bank,  which
principally  consist of home equity  loans,  deposit,  consumer and other loans,
totaled  $21.9  million or 9.2% of the Savings  Bank's  total loan  portfolio at
December 31, 1996.

Purchase of Mortgage Loans.  The Savings Bank has, from time to time,  purchased
mortgage  loans  originated  by  other  lenders,   primarily  loans  secured  by
one-to-four-family  homes.  At December 31, 1996,  $4.3 million,  or 1.8% of the
Savings  Bank's total loan  portfolio  consisted of purchased  mortgage loans or
loan   participations.   Purchased   mortgage  loans   consisted   primarily  of
one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans.

Secondary  Market  Activities.  The Savings Bank  participates  in the secondary
market  through  a  correspondent  relationship,  originating  loans  (primarily
30-year fixed-rate loans) which are funded by the investor  correspondent rather
than by making and selling the loans,  thereby  eliminating  the Savings  Bank's
interest  rate risk on such loans.  Such loans are closed on the Savings  Bank's
documents with funds provided by the investor  correspondent at closing with all
credit  conditions  established by the investor  correspondent  being  satisfied
prior to the issuance of a loan commitment.  The Savings Bank receives a fee for
originating,  processing  and closing the loans and reports the loans to the OTS
as loans  originated and sold. In the year ended  December 31, 1996,  such loans
amounted to $2.4 million or 3.2% of total mortgage loans originated.

One-to-Four-Family Mortgage Lending. The Savings Bank's primary lending emphasis
is on the  origination  of first  mortgage  loans secured by  one-to-four-family
residences within its primary lending area. Such residences are primarily single
family homes,  including  condominium and townhouses,  that serve as the primary
residence  of the owner.  To a lesser  degree,  the Savings  Bank makes loans on
residences used as second homes or as investments.  The Savings Bank also offers
second mortgage loans which are underwritten  applying the same standards as for
first mortgage loans.

In the years ended  December 31, 1994,  1995 and 1996,  the Savings Bank's total
mortgage loan  originations  amounted to $47.4 million,  $50.3 million and $74.4
million,  respectively, of which $40.6 million, $46.1 million and $62.9 million,
respectively, were secured by one-to-four-family properties.

At  December  31,   1996,   81.0%  of  total  loans   receivable   consisted  of
one-to-four-family residential loans, of which 74.2% were ARM loans. The Savings
Bank's ARM loans may carry an initial interest rate which is less than the fully
indexed rate for the loan.  The initial  discounted  rate is  determined  by the
Savings Bank in accordance with market and competitive factors. The Savings Bank
offers one-,  three- and five-year ARM loans which adjust by a maximum of 2% per
adjustment period,  with a lifetime cap on increases of 5% to 6%, depending upon
the program chosen.

The Savings  Bank's  policy on  one-to-four-family  residential  mortgage  loans
generally is to lend up to 80% of the appraised  value of property  securing the
loan,  or up to 95% if private  mortgage  insurance is obtained on the amount of
the loan which exceeds 80%.

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending.  As of December 31, 1996, $13.6
million,  or 5.73% of the  Savings  Bank's  total loan  portfolio  consisted  of
commercial  real estate loans and $4.2 million,  or 1.80% of the Savings  Bank's
total loan portfolio, consisted of multi-family residential loans.

The  commercial  real estate loans in the Savings  Bank's  portfolio  consist of
fixed-rate and ARM loans which were originated at prevailing  market rates.  The
Savings  Bank's policy has been to originate  commercial or  multi-family  loans
only in its primary market area.  Commercial and multi-family  residential loans
are generally made in amounts up to 75% of the appraised  value of the property.
In making such loans,  the Savings Bank  primarily  considers  the net operating
income  generated by the real estate to support the debt service,  the financial
resources  and  income  level and  managerial  expertise  of the  borrower,  the
marketability of the property and the Savings Bank's lending experience with the
borrower.

Construction  and Land Loans.  The Savings Bank originates  loans to finance the
construction  of  one-to-four-family   homes  and,  to  a  much  lesser  extent,
originates loans for the acquisition and development of land (either  unimproved
land or improved  lots) on which the purchaser  can then build.  At December 31,
1996,  construction  (excluding  construction/permanent  loans)  and land  loans
totaled $5.5 million or 2.3% of the Savings Bank's total loan portfolio.
<PAGE>
At December 31, 1996,  the Savings Bank had loans in process  (undisbursed  loan
proceeds of construction  loans) of $8.0 million.  Of that amount,  $4.9 million
was  secured  by  residential  mortgages  $2.8  million  secured  by  commercial
mortgages,    and   $230,000    represented    loans   in   process   on   three
construction/permanent  loans to churches.  The Savings  Bank makes  residential
construction  loans  to  homeowners  on  a  long-term  basis  with  amortization
beginning  at the  conclusion  of  construction,  usually  a period of about six
months.  Such loans are carried in the  one-to-four-family  category and are not
separately classified as construction loans.  Residential  construction loans to
builders are carried in the construction and land category.

Construction   and   land   loans   also   include    construction   loans   for
one-to-four-family  residential  property  for which the  borrower  will  obtain
permanent  financing  from  another  lender.  Such  loans  bear a fixed  rate of
interest that equals prime plus 2.0% during the construction period. The Savings
Bank  obtains a commitment  for the  permanent  financing  from the other lender
prior to originating the construction loan.

Consumer and Other Lending.  At December 31, 1996,  $21.9 million or 9.2% of the
Savings  Bank's  total loan  portfolio  consisted  of consumer  and other loans,
including home equity loans and lines of credit for consumer  purposes and, to a
lesser extent, home improvement loans and secured and unsecured personal loans.

The Savings  Bank's  home  equity  loans are  originated  on  one-to-four-family
residences,  either on a  fixed-rate  basis with terms of up to 10 years or as a
balloon loan with terms up to five years with fifteen year amortization periods.
Those loans are generally limited to aggregate  outstanding  indebtedness on the
property  securing the loan of 80% of the loan to value ratio.  The Savings Bank
also offers  home  equity  lines of credit,  which bear  prime-based  adjustable
interest  rates with terms up to fifteen  years.  Such loans  generally  require
monthly payments of interest plus 1.5% of the balance outstanding.

Consumer loans are offered primarily on a fixed-rate,  short-term basis.  Except
for second  mortgage  loans which are  underwritten  pursuant  to the  standards
applicable to one-to-four-family  residential loans, the underwriting  standards
employed by the Savings Bank for consumer loans include a  determination  of the
applicant's  payment  history on other debts and an assessment of the borrower's
ability to make payments on the proposed loan and other indebtedness.

Loan  Approval  and  Authority.  Mortgage  loan  approval  authority  for  loans
exceeding  $100,000  has been  retained  by the Board of  Directors  which meets
weekly in its capacity as the Executive  Committee of the Board to consider loan
recommendations  of the Loan  Committee.  The Loan Committee is comprised of two
outside  directors,  the President and the Senior Lending Officer of the Savings
Bank.  Management has been delegated  authority to approve mortgage loans,  home
equity loans, home equity lines of credit,  consumer loans and other loans up to
$100,000.

The Savings  Bank's policy is to require title and hazard  insurance on all real
estate loans,  except home equity loans for which a title search is conducted in
lieu of obtaining title insurance. Borrowers may be permitted to pay real estate
taxes and hazard  insurance  premiums  applicable to the secured  property for a
mortgage  loan.  In some  instances,  borrowers may be required to advance funds
together  with each  payment of  principal  and  interest  to a mortgage  escrow
account from which the Savings Bank makes  disbursements  for items such as real
estate taxes, hazard insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums.

Asset Quality

Delinquent  Loans  and  Nonperforming  Assets.  Loans  are  generally  placed on
nonaccrual  status when the  collection  of  principal or interest is 90 days or
more past due, or earlier if  collection is deemed  uncertain.  The Savings Bank
provides  an  allowance  for  accrued  interest  deemed  uncollectible.  Accrued
interest  receivable is reported net of the allowance for uncollected  interest.
Loans may be reinstated to accrual status when all payments are brought  current
and, in the opinion of  management,  collection of the remaining  balance can be
reasonably expected.

(1) The Savings Bank has no insubstance foreclosed loans.

At  December  31,  1996,  the  Savings  Bank had no  accruing  loans  which were
contractually  past  due 90 days or more as to  principal  and  interest  and no
troubled  debt  restructurings  as defined by Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 15.  Nonaccrual loans for which interest has been reduced totalled
approximately  $666,000,  $174,000 and $329,000 at December 31, 1996,  1995, and
1994,  respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 1996, interest income that
would  have  been  recorded  under the  original  terms of  nonaccrual  loans at
December 31, 1996 and interest income actually recognized is summarized below:

Classified Assets. Federal regulations and the Savings Bank's policy require the
classification  of loans and other assets,  such as debt and equity  securities,
considered  to be of  lesser  quality  as  "substandard",  "doubtful"  or "loss"
assets. An asset is considered  "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by
the  current net worth and paying  capacity of the obligor or of the  collateral
pledged,  if  any.  "Substandard"  assets  include  those  characterized  by the
"distinct  possibility"  that the  institution  will sustain  "some loss" if the
deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the
weaknesses   inherent  in  those  classified   "substandard,"   with  the  added
characteristic  that the weaknesses  present make  "collection or liquidation in
full", on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, "highly
questionable and improbable."  Assets  classified as "loss" are those considered
"uncollectible"  and of such  little  value  that  their  continuance  as assets
without  the  establishment  of a specific  loss  reserve is not  warranted.  In
addition, the Savings Bank's policies require that assets which do not currently
expose the insured  institution to sufficient risk to warrant  classification as
substandard  but possess other  weaknesses are designated  "special  mention" by
management.

If an asset is  classified,  the estimated fair value of the asset is determined
and if that  value is less  than  the then  carrying  value  of the  asset,  the
difference is  established as a specific  reserve.  If an asset is classified as
loss, the amount of the asset  classified as loss is reserved.  General reserves
or  general  valuation  allowances  represent  loss  allowances  which have been
established to recognize the inherent risk  associated  with lending  activities
but, unlike specific reserves, are not allocated to particular assets.

The  following  table sets forth  information  concerning  the number and dollar
amount of loans and real estate owned  classified as  "substandard"  or "special
mention" at the dates  indicated.  No loans or real estate owned were classified
"doubtful" or "loss" at those dates.

Allowance  for Loan  Losses.  The Savings  Bank's  allowance  for loan losses is
established  and  maintained  through  a  provision  for  loan  losses  based on
management's  evaluation  of the risk  inherent  in its loan  portfolio  and the
condition  of the  local  economy  in  the  Savings  Bank's  market  area.  Such
evaluation,  which  includes a review of all loans on which full  collectibility
may not be reasonably  assured,  considers,  among other matters,  the estimated
fair value of the underlying collateral, economic and regulatory conditions, and
other  factors that warrant  recognition  in providing for an adequate loan loss
allowance.  Although management believes it uses the best information  available
to make  determinations  with respect to the Savings  Bank's  allowance for loan
losses,  future  adjustments  may  be  necessary  if  economic  conditions  vary
substantially from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the
initial determinations or if other circumstances change.

The following  table sets forth the Savings Bank's  allowance for loan losses at
the dates  indicated,  the provisions  made and the  charge-offs  and recoveries
effected during the years indicated.

Investment Activities

The investment  policy of the Savings Bank, which is established by the Board of
Directors and  implemented by the Chief  Executive  Officer who is designated as
the Investment Officer, is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity,
to generate a favorable return on investments  without  incurring undue interest
rate and credit risk, and to complement  the Savings Bank's lending  activities.
In  establishing  its  investment  strategies,  the Savings Bank  considers  its
business and growth plans, the economic environment,  the types of securities to
be held and other factors.  Federally  chartered  savings  institutions have the
authority  to  invest  in  various  types of  assets,  including  U.S.  Treasury
obligations,  securities of various federal  agencies,  certain  certificates of
deposit of insured banks and savings institutions,  certain bankers acceptances,
repurchase  agreements,  loans on federal funds, and, subject to certain limits,
commercial paper and mutual funds.

On January 1, 1994,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 115.  That  statement  requires  investment  and  mortgage-backed
securities  that the  Company  has the  positive  intent and  ability to hold to
maturity  to be  classified  as  held-to-maturity  securities  and  reported  at
amortized  cost.  Securities  that are held  principally for selling in the near
term are to be classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with
unrealized  gains and losses included in earnings.  Securities not classified as
either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are to be classified as
available-for-sale  securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported in a separate  component  of
stockholders' equity.

Mortgage-Backed Securities

The Savings Bank invests in  collateralized  mortgage  obligations  ("CMOs") and
mortgage-backed  securities  such as government  pass-through  certificates.  At
December 31,  1996,  the Savings  Bank's  mortgage-backed  securities  portfolio
totaled $65.7 million, or 19.0% of total assets. The  weighted-average  interest
rate on the total mortgage-backed  securities portfolio at December 31, 1996 was
6.45%. The mortgage-backed securities are not due at a single maturity date, and
accordingly, contractual maturity information is not presented herein. CMOs, net
of related  premiums  and  discounts,  totaled  $34.2  million or 52.0% of total
mortgage-backed securities.

CMOs are typically issued by a special purpose entity, which may be organized in
any  of  a  variety  of  legal  forms,  such  as a  trust,  a  corporation  or a
partnership.  The entity  combines pools of pass-through  securities,  which are
used to collateralize the mortgage related securities.  Once combined,  the cash
flows can be divided into  different  "tranches"  or  "classes"  of  securities,
thereby  creating  more  predictable  average  lives for each  security than the
underlying  pass-through  pools.  Under this  security  structure  all principal
repayments   from  the   various   mortgage   pools  can  be   allocated   to  a
mortgage-related  securities class or classes  structured to have priority until
it has been paid off.  Thus,  these  securities  are  designed  to  address  the
reinvestment  concerns associated with mortgage-backed  security  pass-throughs,
namely that they tend to pay off more  rapidly  when  interest  rates fall.  The
Savings  Bank's CMOs have  coupon  rates  ranging  from 4.00% to 7.51% and had a
weighted average yield of 5.91% at December 31, 1996.

The Savings  Bank's  policy is to purchase CMOs rated AA or better by nationally
recognized  rating services.  The majority of the CMOs owned by the Savings Bank
are insured or guaranteed either directly or indirectly, through mortgage-backed
securities underlying the obligations issued by the FNMA, FHLMC or GNMA.
<PAGE>
At December 31, 1996,  the Savings Bank had $34.2  million in CMOs  representing
9.9% of total assets. Of that amount,  $12.4 million or 36.3% had floating rates
with caps ranging from 8.50% to 12.65% and which adjust on a monthly basis.

Other mortgage-backed  securities,  net, totaled $31.5 million or 48.0% of total
mortgage-backed   securities.   Other  mortgage-backed   securities  consist  of
pass-through certificates issued by the Government National Mortgage Association
("GNMA"),  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  ("FHLMC") and the Federal
National Mortgage Association ("FNMA").

At December 31, 1996, the Savings Bank had mortgage-backed  securities available
for sale with an aggregate carrying value of $18.8 million,  consisting of CMOs,
FHLMC five year balloons and FNMA certificates.

Sources of Funds

General. Repayments of mortgage-backed securities, loan repayments, deposits and
cash flows  generated  from  operations  are the primary  sources of the Savings
Bank's funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes.

Deposits.  The Savings Bank offers a variety of deposit  accounts having a range
of interest  rates and terms.  The Savings  Bank's  deposits  consist of regular
savings,   non-interest-bearing   checking,  NOW  checking,   money  market  and
certificate  accounts.  Of the  deposit  accounts at December  31,  1996,  $25.4
million or 8.9% consist of individual retirement accounts ("IRAs").

The  Savings  Bank has  maintained  a  relatively  high  level of core  deposits
consisting of passbook and statement savings, money market, non-interest-bearing
checking,  and NOW checking,  which has contributed to a low cost of funds. Such
core  deposits  represented  30.40%,  25.24%  and  25.02% of total  deposits  at
December 31, 1994, 1995, and 1996, respectively.

Borrowings

The Savings Bank is authorized to obtain advances from the FHLB of Atlanta which
generally would be  collateralized  by a blanket lien against the Savings Bank's
mortgage  portfolio.  Such  advances may be made  pursuant to several  different
credit  programs,  each  of  which  has its  own  interest  rate  and  range  of
maturities.  The maximum  amount that the FHLB of Atlanta will advance to member
institutions,  including  the Savings  Bank,  for  purposes  other than  meeting
withdrawals, fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the
OTS and the FHLB of Atlanta.

From time to time,  the  Savings  Bank enters into  agreements  with  nationally
recognized  primary  securities  dealers  under  which the  Savings  Bank  sells
securities subject to repurchase  agreements.  Such agreements are accounted for
as  borrowings  by the Savings Bank and are secured by the  securities  sold. At
December  31,  1996,  the  Savings  Bank had  $8.0  million  of such  borrowings
outstanding.

Subsidiary Activities

The  Savings  Bank  has  one  wholly-owned   subsidiary,   Lake  County  Service
Corporation.  Lake County  Service  Corporation  was formed to develop a 100-lot
subdivision and is now substantially inactive, having sold all but one lot. Lake
County Service  Corporation  also owns an 8.4 acre  commercial  parcel and a one
acre lot adjoining the Savings Bank's main office.

Personnel

As of December 31,  1996,  the Savings Bank had 104  full-time  employees  and 8
part-time  employees.   The  employees  are  not  represented  by  a  collective
bargaining  unit,  and the Savings  Bank  considers  its  relationship  with its
employees to be good.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

General

The Company,  as a savings and loan holding company, is required to file certain
reports with, and otherwise  comply with the rules and regulations of the Office
of Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS") under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended (the
"HOLA").  In  addition,  the  activities  of savings  institutions,  such as the
Savings  Bank,  are governed by the HOLA and the Federal  Deposit  Insurance Act
("FDI Act").
<PAGE>
The Savings Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision
by the OTS,  as its  primary  federal  regulator,  and the FDIC,  as the deposit
insurer.  The Savings  Bank is a member of the Federal  Home Loan Bank  ("FHLB")
System and its  deposit  accounts  are  insured up to  applicable  limits by the
Savings  Association  Insurance  Fund ("SAIF")  managed by the FDIC. The Savings
Bank must file reports with the OTS and the FDIC  concerning  its activities and
financial  condition  in addition to  obtaining  regulatory  approvals  prior to
entering into certain  transactions  such as mergers with, or  acquisitions  of,
other  savings   institutions.   The  OTS  and/or  the  FDIC  conduct   periodic
examinations to test the Savings Bank's safety and soundness and compliance with
various  regulatory   requirements.   Regulation  and  supervision  establish  a
comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and are
intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.  The
regulatory structure also gives the regulatory  authorities extensive discretion
in connection with their supervisory and enforcement  activities and examination
policies,  including  policies with respect to the  classification of assets and
the  establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory  purposes.  Any
change in such  regulatory  requirements  and policies,  whether by the OTS, the
FDIC or the Congress,  could have a material  adverse  impact on the Company and
the Savings Bank and their  operations.  Certain of the regulatory  requirements
applicable  to the  Savings  Bank and to the  Company  are  referred to below or
elsewhere  herein.  The  description  of statutory  provisions  and  regulations
applicable to savings institutions and their holding companies set forth in this
Form 10-K does not purport to be a complete  description  of such  statutes  and
regulations and their effects on the Savings Bank and the Company.

Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a nondiversified  unitary savings and loan holding company within
the meaning of the HOLA.  As a unitary  savings and loan  holding  company,  the
Company  generally  is not  restricted  under  existing  laws as to the types of
business  activities  in which it may engage,  provided  that the  Savings  Bank
continues  to  be a  qualified  thrift  lender  ("QTL").  See  "Federal  Savings
Institution Regulation - QTL Test." Upon any non-supervisory  acquisition by the
Company of another  savings  institution or savings bank that meets the QTL test
and is deemed to be a savings institution by the OTS, the Company would become a
multiple  savings and loan holding company (if the acquired  institution is held
as a separate  subsidiary) and would be subject to extensive  limitations on the
types of  business  activities  in which it could  engage.  The HOLA  limits the
activities of a multiple  savings and loan holding  company and its  non-insured
institution  subsidiaries  primarily to activities  permissible for bank holding
companies  under  Section  4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding  Company Act ("BHC Act"),
subject to the prior approval of the OTS, and certain  activities  authorized by
OTS regulation.
<PAGE>
The HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding  company,  directly or indirectly,
or through one or more  subsidiaries,  from acquiring more than 5% of the voting
stock of another savings  institution or holding company thereof,  without prior
written approval of the OTS;  acquiring or retaining,  with certain  exceptions,
more than 5% of a nonsubsidiary  company engaged in activities  other than those
permitted  by the HOLA;  or  acquiring  or  retaining  control  of a  depository
institution  that is not  insured by the FDIC.  In  evaluating  applications  by
holding  companies to acquire  savings  institutions,  the OTS must consider the
financial  and  managerial  resources  and future  prospects  of the company and
institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance
funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.

The OTS is  prohibited  from  approving any  acquisition  that would result in a
multiple savings and loan holding company  controlling  savings  institutions in
more than one state,  subject to two exceptions:  (i) the approval of interstate
supervisory  acquisitions  by savings and loan  holding  companies  and (ii) the
acquisition  of a savings  institution in another state if the laws of the state
of the target savings  institution  specifically  permit such acquisitions.  The
states  vary in the  extent to which they  permit  interstate  savings  and loan
holding company acquisitions.

Although savings and loan holding  companies are not subject to specific capital
requirements  or  specific  restrictions  on the payment of  dividends  or other
capital  distributions,  HOLA does  prescribe  such  restrictions  on subsidiary
savings institutions as described below. The Savings Bank must notify the OTS 30
days before  declaring any dividend to the Company.  In addition,  the financial
impact of a holding  company on its  subsidiary  institution is a matter that is
evaluated  by the OTS  and the  agency  has  authority  to  order  cessation  of
activities or divestiture of subsidiaries  deemed to pose a threat to the safety
and soundness of the institution.

Federal Savings Institution Regulation

Capital  Requirements.  The OTS capital regulations require savings institutions
to meet three minimum  capital  standards:  a 1.5% tangible  capital ratio, a 3%
leverage  (core) capital ratio and an 8% risk-based  capital ratio. In addition,
the prompt  corrective  action  standards  discussed  below also  establish,  in
effect,  a minimum 2% tangible  capital  standard,  a 4% leverage (core) capital
ratio (3% for  institutions  receiving the highest rating on the CAMEL financial
institution  rating system),  and, together with the risk-based capital standard
itself,  a 4% Tier I  risk-based  capital  standard.  Core capital is defined as
common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock and related surplus,  and minority interests in equity
accounts  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  less  intangibles  other than  certain
purchased  mortgage  servicing  rights and credit  card  relationships.  The OTS
regulations  also require  that, in meeting the  tangible,  leverage  (core) and
risk-based capital standards,  institutions must generally deduct investments in
and loans to  subsidiaries  engaged in activities not permissible for a national
bank.
<PAGE>
The  risk-based   capital  standard  for  savings   institutions   requires  the
maintenance of Tier I (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital
and supplementary  capital) to risk-weighted  assets of 4% and 8%, respectively.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain
off-balance sheet assets,  are multiplied by risk-weight  factors of 0% to 100%,
as assigned by the OTS capital  regulation  based on the risks OTS  believes are
inherent  in the type of asset.  The  components  of Tier I (core)  capital  are
equivalent to those discussed earlier.  The components of supplementary  capital
currently include  cumulative  preferred stock,  long-term  perpetual  preferred
stock,  mandatory  convertible   securities,   subordinated  debt,  intermediate
preferred  stock and the  allowance  for loan and lease  losses  with the latter
limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted  assets.  Overall,  the amount of
supplementary  capital  included as part of total capital  cannot exceed 100% of
core capital.

The OTS regulatory  capital  requirements also incorporate an interest rate risk
component.  Savings institutions with "above normal" interest rate risk exposure
are subject to a deduction from total capital for purposes of calculating  their
risk-based capital requirements.  A savings institution's  interest rate risk is
measured  by the decline in the net  portfolio  value of its assets  (i.e.,  the
difference  between  incoming  and outgoing  discounted  cash flows from assets,
liabilities  and  off-balance   sheet   contracts)  that  would  result  from  a
hypothetical  200 basis point  increase or  decrease  in market  interest  rates
divided  by the  estimated  economic  value  of  the  institution's  assets.  In
calculating  its total  capital  under the  risk-based  capital  rule, a savings
institution whose measured interest rate risk exposure exceeds 2% must deduct an
amount equal to one-half of the difference  between the  institution's  measured
interest rate risk and 2%,  multiplied by the  estimated  economic  value of the
institution's  assets.  The  Director  of the OTS may  waive or defer a  savings
institution's  interest rate risk component on a  case-by-case  basis. A savings
institution with assets of less than $300 million and risk-based  capital ratios
in excess of 12% is not subject to the interest rate risk component,  unless the
OTS  determines   otherwise.   For  the  present  time,  the  OTS  has  deferred
implementation  of the interest rate risk  component.  At December 31, 1996, the
Savings  Bank  met each of its  capital  requirements,  in each  case on a fully
phased-in basis and it is anticipated  that the Savings Bank will not be subject
to the interest rate risk component.

1996 relative to fully phased-in regulatory requirements.

Prompt  Corrective  Regulatory  Action.  Under the OTS prompt  corrective action
regulations,  the OTS is required to take certain  supervisory  actions  against
undercapitalized   institutions,   the  severity  of  which   depends  upon  the
institution's degree of undercapitalization. Generally, a savings institution is
considered  "well  capitalized"  if its ratio of total capital to  risk-weighted
assets is at least  10%,  its ratio of Tier I (core)  capital  to  risk-weighted
assets is at least 6%, its ratio of core capital to total assets is at least 5%,
and it is not  subject to any order or  directive  by the OTS to meet a specific
capital  level.  A  savings  institution  generally  is  considered  "adequately
capitalized" if its ratio of total capital to  risk-weighted  assets is at least
8%, its ratio of Tier I (core) capital to  risk-weighted  assets is at least 4%,
and its  ratio  of core  capital  to  total  assets  is at  least  4% (3% if the
institution receives the highest CAMEL rating). A savings institution that has a
ratio of total capital to risk weighted  assets of less than 8%, a ratio of Tier
I (core)  capital  to  risk-weighted  assets  of less than 4% or a ratio of core
capital to total  assets of less than 4% (3% or less for  institutions  with the
highest  examination rating) is considered to be  "undercapitalized."  A savings
institution  that has a total  risk-based  capital  ratio less than 6%, a Tier 1
capital  ratio  of less  than 3% or a  leverage  ratio  that is less  than 3% is
considered to be "significantly undercapitalized" and a savings institution that
has a tangible  capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be
"critically  undercapitalized."  Subject  to a  narrow  exception,  the  banking
regulator is required to appoint a receiver or  conservator  for an  institution
that is  "critically  undercapitalized."  The  regulation  also  provides that a
capital restoration plan must be filed with the OTS within 45 days of the date a
savings   institution   receives   notice   that   it   is   "undercapitalized,"
"significantly  undercapitalized" or "critically  undercapitalized."  Compliance
with the plan must be guaranteed  by any parent  holding  company.  In addition,
numerous  mandatory  supervisory  actions  become  immediately  applicable to an
undercapitalized   institution,   including,   but  not  limited  to,  increased
monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth,  capital  distributions and
expansion.  The OTS  could  also  take  any  one of a  number  of  discretionary
supervisory  actions,  including  the  issuance of a capital  directive  and the
replacement of senior executive officers and directors.

Insurance  of Deposit  Accounts.  Deposits  of the  Savings  Bank are  presently
insured by the SAIF.  Both the SAIF and the Bank  Insurance  Fund ("BIF"),  (the
deposit  insurance  fund  that  covers  most  commercial  bank  deposits),   are
statutorily  required to be recapitalized to a 1.25% of insured reserve deposits
ratio.  Until recently,  members of the SAIF and BIF were paying average deposit
insurance  premiums of between 24 and 25 basis points.  The BIF met the required
reserve  in 1995,  whereas  the  SAIF was not  expected  to meet or  exceed  the
required  level  until  2002  at the  earliest,  due in  part  to the  statutory
requirement that SAIF members make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by
the Financing Corporation ("FICO") to recapitalize the predecessor to the SAIF.

Once the BIF achieved the 1.25% ratio,  the FDIC adopted a new  assessment  rate
schedule of from 0 to 27 basis  points  under  which 92% of BIF members  paid an
annual premium of only $2,000, but retained the previously  existing  assessment
rate schedule  applicable to SAIF member  institutions of 23 to 31 basis points.
Thus,  SAIF  members,  such as the  Savings  Bank were  placed at a  substantial
competitive  disadvantage  to BIF members  with  respect to pricing of loans and
deposits and the ability to achieve lower operating costs.

On September 30, 1996, the President signed into law the Deposit Insurance Funds
Act of 1996 (the  "Funds  Act")  which,  among other  things,  imposed a special
one-time assessment on SAIF member institutions,  including the Savings Bank, to
recapitalize  the SAIF. As required by the Funds Act, the FDIC imposed a special
assessment of 65.7 basis points on SAIF assessable deposits held as of March 31,
1995,  payable  November  27,  1996 (the "SAIF  Special  Assessment").  The SAIF
Special  Assessment  was  recognized  by the  Savings  Bank as an expense in the
quarter  ended  September  30, 1996 and is generally  tax  deductible.  The SAIF
Special  Assessment  recorded by the Savings Bank  amounted to $1.7 million on a
pre-tax basis and $1.0 million on an after-tax basis.

The Funds Act also spreads the  obligations for payment of the FICO bonds across
all SAIF and BIF  members.  Beginning on January 1, 1997,  BIF deposits  will be
assessed for FICO payment of 1.3 basis points, while SAIF deposits will pay 6.48
basis points.  Full pro rata sharing of the FICO  payments  between BIF and SAIF
members  will  occur on the  earlier  of January 1, 2000 or the date the BIF and
SAIF are merged. The Funds Act specifies that the BIF and SAIF will be merged on
January 1, 1999, provided no savings associations remain as of that time.

As a result of the Funds Act, the FDIC lowered SAIF assessments to 0 to 27 basis
points as of January 1, 1997, a range  comparable  to that of BIF members.  SAIF
members will also continue to make the FICO payments described above. Management
cannot  predict the level of FDIC insurance  assessments  on an on-going  basis,
whether the savings  association  charter will be  eliminated or whether the BIF
and SAIF will eventually be merged.

The Savings Bank's  assessment  rate for fiscal 1996 was 23 basis points and the
premium paid for 1996,  excluding the SAIF special assessment,  was $624,000.  A
significant  increase in SAIF  insurance  premiums  would likely have an adverse
effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Savings Bank.

Under the FDI Act,  insurance of deposits may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a
finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound  practices,  is in
an unsafe or unsound  condition  to  continue  operations  or has  violated  any
applicable law, regulation,  rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the
OTS. The management of the Savings Bank does not know of any practice, condition
or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
<PAGE>
Thrift  Rechartering  Legislation.  The Funds Act provides that the BIF and SAIF
will merge on January 1, 1999 if there are no more  savings  associations  as of
that date. That legislation also requires that the Department of Treasury submit
a report to Congress by March 31,  1997 that makes  recommendations  regarding a
common financial  institutions charter,  including whether the separate charters
for thrifts and banks should be  abolished.  Various  proposals to eliminate the
federal thrift  charter,  create a uniform  financial  institutions  charter and
abolish  the OTS have been  introduced  in  Congress.  The bills  would  require
federal savings institutions to convert to a national bank or some type of state
charter by a specified  date (January 1, 1998 in one bill,  June 30, 1998 in the
other) or they would  automatically  become  national banks.  Converted  federal
thrifts  would  generally  be  required  to conform  their  activities  to those
permitted for the charter selected and divestiture of nonconforming assets would
be required over a two year period, subject to two possible one year extensions.
State chartered  thrifts would become subject to the same federal  regulation as
applies to state commercial banks.  Holding  companies for savings  institutions
would become  subject to the same  regulation as holding  companies that control
commercial banks, with a limited  grandfather  provision for unitary savings and
loan holding company  activities.  The Savings Bank is unable to predict whether
such  legislation  would be enacted,  the extent to which the legislation  would
restrict  or  disrupt  its  operations  or  whether  the BIF and SAIF funds will
eventually merge.

Loans to One  Borrower.  Under  the HOLA,  savings  institutions  are  generally
subject to the limits on loans to one  borrower  applicable  to national  banks.
Generally, savings institutions may not make a loan or extend credit to a single
or related  group of  borrowers in excess of 15% of its  unimpaired  capital and
surplus.  An additional  amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired  capital
and surplus, if such loan is secured by readily-marketable  collateral, which is
defined to include certain  financial  instruments and bullion.  At December 31,
1996,  the Savings  Bank's limit on loans to one borrower was $6.4  million.  At
December 31, 1996, the Savings Bank's largest aggregate  outstanding  balance of
loans to one borrower was $1.8 million.

QTL Test. The HOLA requires  savings  institutions to meet a QTL test. Under the
QTL test, a savings and loan association is required to maintain at least 65% of
its "portfolio assets" (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20%
of total assets; (ii) intangibles,  including  goodwill;  and (iii) the value of
property used to conduct  business) in certain  "qualified  thrift  investments"
(primarily  residential  mortgages and related  investments,  including  certain
mortgage-backed securities) in at least 9 months out of each 12 month period.

A savings  institution  that fails the QTL test is subject to certain  operating
restrictions  and may be required to convert to a bank  charter.  As of December
31, 1996, the Savings Bank maintained 93.6% of its portfolio assets in qualified
thrift investments and, therefore, met the QTL test.
<PAGE>
Limitation on Capital Distributions. OTS regulations impose limitations upon all
capital distributions by savings institutions,  such as cash dividends, payments
to  repurchase  or otherwise  acquire its shares,  payments to  shareholders  of
another institution in a cash-out merger and other distributions charged against
capital.  The rule  establishes  three  tiers of  institutions,  which are based
primarily on the  institutions'  capital levels. An institution that exceeds all
fully  phased-in  capital  requirements  before  and  after a  proposed  capital
distribution  ("Tier 1 Bank") and has not been  advised by the OTS that it is in
need of more than normal  supervision,  could,  after  prior  notice but without
obtaining approval of the OTS, make capital distributions during a calendar year
equal to the greater of (i) 100% of its net earnings to date during the calendar
year plus the amount that would reduce by one-half its "surplus  capital  ratio"
(the  excess  capital  over its fully  phased-in  capital  requirements)  at the
beginning  of the  calendar  year or (ii) 75% of its net income for the previous
four  quarters.   Any  additional  capital  distributions  would  require  prior
regulatory  approval.  In the event the Savings  Bank's  capital  fell below its
regulatory  requirements or the OTS notified it that it was in need of more than
normal  supervision,  the Savings Bank's  ability to make capital  distributions
could be  restricted.  In addition,  the OTS could  prohibit a proposed  capital
distribution  by any  institution,  which would  otherwise  be  permitted by the
regulation,  if the OTS determines that such  distribution  would  constitute an
unsafe or unsound practice. In December 1994, the OTS proposed amendments to its
capital  distribution  regulation that would generally  authorize the payment of
capital  distributions  without OTS approval  provided that the payment does not
cause the  institution to be  undercapitalized  within the meaning of the prompt
corrective  action  regulation.  However,  institutions  in  a  holding  company
structure would still have a prior notice requirement. At December 31, 1996, the
Savings Bank was a Tier 1 Bank.

Liquidity.  The Savings Bank is required to maintain an average daily balance of
specified  liquid assets equal to a monthly average of not less than a specified
percentage of its net withdrawable deposit accounts plus short-term  borrowings.
This liquidity  requirement is currently 5% but may be changed from time to time
by the OTS to any amount within the range of 4% to 10%  depending  upon economic
conditions and the savings flows of member  institutions.  OTS regulations  also
require each member savings  institution to maintain an average daily balance of
short-term liquid assets at a specified  percentage  (currently 1%) of the total
of its net withdrawable  deposit accounts and borrowings  payable in one year or
less.  Monetary  penalties  may be imposed for  failure to meet these  liquidity
requirements.  The Savings Bank's liquidity and short-term  liquidity ratios for
December  31,  1996  were  13.5%  and  4.3%  respectively,  which  exceeded  the
applicable  requirements.  The Savings  Bank has never been  subject to monetary
penalties for failure to meet its liquidity requirements.

Assessments.  Savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the OTS to
fund the agency's  operations.  The general  assessments,  paid on a semi-annual
basis,  are computed  upon the savings  institution's  total  assets,  including
consolidated  subsidiaries,  as reported in the Savings Bank's latest  quarterly
thrift financial report. The assessments paid by the Savings Bank for the fiscal
years  ended   December  31,  1996  and  1995  totalled   $83,000  and  $79,000,
respectively.
<PAGE>
Branching.  OTS regulations permit nationwide  branching by federally  chartered
savings  institutions  to the extent  allowed by federal  statute.  This permits
federal   savings   institutions  to  establish   interstate   networks  and  to
geographically  diversify their loan  portfolios and lines of business.  The OTS
authority  preempts any state law  purporting  to regulate  branching by federal
savings institutions.

Transactions  with Related  Parties.  The Savings Bank's  authority to engage in
transactions  with  related  parties or  "affiliates"  (e.g..,  any company that
controls or is under common control with an  institution,  including the Company
and any non-savings institution subsidiaries) is limited by Sections 23A and 23B
of the Federal Reserve Act ("FRA").  Section 23A limits the aggregate  amount of
covered  transactions  with any  individual  affiliate to 10% of the capital and
surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions
with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings  institution's  capital and
surplus.  Certain  transactions  with  affiliates  are required to be secured by
collateral in an amount and of a type  described in Section 23A and the purchase
of low quality  assets from  affiliates  is  generally  prohibited.  Section 23B
generally  provides that certain  transactions with affiliates,  including loans
and asset purchases, must be on terms and under circumstances,  including credit
standards,  that are  substantially  the same or at  least as  favorable  to the
institution  as those  prevailing at the time for comparable  transactions  with
non-affiliated companies. In addition,  savings institutions are prohibited from
lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities  that are not permissible
for  bank  holding  companies  and  no  savings  institution  may  purchase  the
securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.

The Savings Bank's authority to extend credit to executive  officers,  directors
and 10% shareholders ("insiders"),  as well as entities such persons control, is
governed by Sections  22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and  Regulation  O  thereunder.
Among other  things,  such loans are required to be made on terms  substantially
the same as those offered to  unaffiliated  individuals  and not to involve more
than the normal risk of repayment.  Recent legislation  created an exception for
loans  made  pursuant  to a  benefit  or  compensation  program  that is  widely
available to all employees of the  institution  and does not give  preference to
executive officers over other employees. Regulation O also places individual and
aggregate  limits on the amount of loans the  Savings  Bank may make to insiders
based,  in part, on the Savings  Bank's  capital  position and requires  certain
board approval procedures to be followed.

Enforcement.  Under the FDI Act, the OTS has primary enforcement  responsibility
over savings  institutions  and has the authority to bring  actions  against the
institution and all institution-affiliated  parties, including stockholders, and
any  attorneys,   appraisers  and   accountants   who  knowingly  or  recklessly
participate  in wrongful  action likely to have an adverse  effect on an insured
institution.  Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital
directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers  and/or  directors to
institution  of   receivership,   conservatorship   or  termination  of  deposit
insurance.  Civil  penalties  cover a wide range of violations and can amount to
$25,000 per day, or even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. Under
the FDI Act, the FDIC has the  authority to recommend to the Director of the OTS
enforcement action to be taken with respect to a particular savings institution.
If action  is not taken by the  Director,  the FDIC has  authority  to take such
action  under  certain  circumstances.  Federal  law also  establishes  criminal
penalties for certain violations.
<PAGE>
Standards for Safety and Soundness.  The federal  banking  agencies have adopted
Interagency   Guidelines   Prescribing   Standards   for  Safety  and  Soundness
("Guidelines")  and a final rule to  implement  safety and  soundness  standards
required  under the FDI Act. The  Guidelines  set forth the safety and soundness
standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems
at  insured  depository   institutions  before  capital  becomes  impaired.  The
standards set forth in the Guidelines  address internal controls and information
systems;  internal  audit  system;  credit  underwriting;   loan  documentation;
interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; and compensation,  fees and benefits.
If the appropriate  federal banking agency  determines that an institution fails
to meet any standard  prescribed by the  Guidelines,  the agency may require the
institution  to submit to the agency an  acceptable  plan to achieve  compliance
with the  standard,  as  required  by the FDI Act.  The final  rule  establishes
deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness  compliance
plans when such plans are required.

Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve Board regulations  require savings  institutions to maintain
non-interest  earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW
and regular  checking  accounts).  During fiscal 1996, the Federal Reserve Board
regulations  generally  required that reserves be maintained  against  aggregate
transaction  accounts as follows: for accounts aggregating $52.0 million or less
(subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve  requirement is
3%; and for  accounts  aggregating  greater  than  $52.0  million,  the  reserve
requirement  is $1.6  million  plus 10%  (subject to  adjustment  by the Federal
Reserve  Board  between 8% and 14%) against  that  portion of total  transaction
accounts  in excess  of $52.0  million.  The first  $4.3  million  of  otherwise
reservable  balances  (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) were
exempted from the reserve  requirements.  The Savings Bank is in compliance with
the  foregoing  requirements.  The  balances  maintained  to  meet  the  reserve
requirements  imposed  by the  Federal  Reserve  Board  may be used  to  satisfy
liquidity requirements imposed by the OTS.

                           FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION

Federal Taxation

General.  The Company and the Savings Bank report their income on a consolidated
basis using the accrual method of accounting,  and are subject to federal income
taxation  in the  same  manner  as  other  corporations  with  some  exceptions,
including particularly the Savings Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed below.
The  following  discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does
not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the
Savings  Bank or the  Company.  The Savings Bank was last audited by the IRS for
the year ended December 31, 1989. For its 1996 taxable year, the Savings Bank is
subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of 34%.

Bad Debt Reserves.  For fiscal years beginning prior to January 1, 1996,  thrift
institutions  which  qualified  under  certain   definitional  tests  and  other
conditions  of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended (the "Code") were
permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from
taxable income for annual  additions to their bad debt reserve.  A reserve could
be  established  for bad debts on  qualifying  real  property  loans  (generally
secured by interests in real property  improved or to be improved) under (i) the
Percentage of Taxable  Income  Method (the "PTI Method") or (ii) the  Experience
Method.  The reserve for  nonqualifying  loans was computed using the Experience
Method.

The Small  Business  Job  Protection  Act of 1996 (the  "1996  Act"),  which was
enacted on August 2, 1996,  requires  savings  institutions to recapture  (i.e.,
take into income) certain portions of their  accumulated bad debt reserves.  For
fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1995,  thrift  institutions that would
be  treated  as small  banks  are  allowed  to  utilize  the  Experience  Method
applicable to such institutions,  while thrift  institutions that are treated as
large banks (those  generally  exceeding $500 million in assets) are required to
use only the specific charge-off method.  Thus, the PTI Method of accounting for
bad debts is no longer available for any financial institution.

Use of the PTI Method had the effect of reducing  the  marginal  rate of federal
tax on the  Savings  Bank's  income  to  31.3%,  exclusive  of  any  minimum  or
environmental  tax, as compared to the maximum corporate federal income tax rate
of 34%.

A thrift institution required to change its method of computing reserves for bad
debts will treat such change as a change in method of  accounting,  initiated by
the taxpayer,  and having been made with the consent of the IRS. Any  adjustment
required  to be taken  into  income  with  respect  to such  change in method of
accounting  generally will be taken into income ratably over a six-taxable  year
period, beginning with the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1995,
subject to the residential loan  requirement.  At December 31, 1996, the Savings
Bank had  approximately  $900,000 of deferred tax  liabilities  recorded for the
recapture of its bad debt reserves.
<PAGE>
Under  the  residential  loan  requirement  provision,   the  recapture  of  the
applicable  excess reserves  required by the 1996 Act will be suspended for each
of two  successive  taxable  years,  beginning  with the Savings  Bank's current
taxable  year,  in which the Savings Bank  originates  in that year a minimum of
certain  residential  loans based upon the average of the  principal  amounts of
such loans made by the Savings Bank during its six taxable  years  preceding its
current taxable year. Also for its current and future taxable years, the Savings
Bank is permitted to make additions to its tax bad debt  reserves.  In addition,
the Savings  Bank is required to recapture  (i.e.,  take into income) over a six
year  period  the  excess  of the  balance  of its tax bad debt  reserves  as of
December 31, 1995 over the balance of such reserves as of December 31, 1987.

Distributions.  Under the 1996 Act,  if the  Savings  Bank  makes  "non-dividend
distributions"  to the Company,  such  distributions  will be considered to have
been made from the Savings Bank's  unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves (including
the balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987) to the extent thereof,  and
then from the Savings Bank's  supplemental  reserve for losses on loans,  to the
extent thereof, and an amount based on the amount distributed (but not in excess
of the amount of such  reserves)  will be included in the Savings Bank's income.
Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Savings Bank's
current and accumulated  earnings and profits,  as calculated for federal income
tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial
or complete  liquidation.  Dividends  paid out of the Savings  Bank's current or
accumulated  earnings and profits will not be so included in the Savings  Bank's
income.

The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount
that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount
of the distribution. Thus, if the Savings Bank makes a non-dividend distribution
to the  Company,  approximately  one  and  one-half  times  the  amount  of such
distribution  (but  not in  excess  of the  amount  of such  reserves)  would be
includable  in income for federal  income tax  purposes,  assuming a 35% federal
corporate  income tax rate.  The Savings  Bank does not intend to pay  dividends
that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.

SAIF Recapitalization  Assessment. The Funds Act levied a 65.7 cent fee on every
$100 of  thrift  deposits  held on  March  31,  1995.  For  financial  statement
purposes,  this  assessment  of $1.7  million  before  taxes was recorded by the
Savings Bank as an expense for the quarter ended  September 30, 1996.  The Funds
Act includes a provision which states that the amount of any special  assessment
paid to capitalize SAIF under this  legislation is deductible  under Section 162
of the Code in the year of payment.
<PAGE>
Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. The Code imposes a tax on alternative minimum
taxable income  ("AMTI") at a rate of 20%. For fiscal years  beginning  prior to
January  1,  1996,  the  excess  of the bad debt  reserve  deduction  using  the
percentage  of taxable  income  method over the  deduction  that would have been
allowable  under the  experience  method is  treated  as a  preference  item for
purposes of computing the AMTI.  Only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating
loss carryovers.  The adjustment to AMTI based on book income is an amount equal
to 75% of the amount by which a corporation's  adjusted current earnings exceeds
its AMTI  (determined  without regard to this  adjustment and prior to reduction
for net  operating  losses).  In addition,  for taxable  years  through 1995, an
environmental  tax of .12% of the  excess of AMTI (with  certain  modifications)
over $2.0  million is imposed  on  corporations,  including  the  Savings  Bank,
whether or not an Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT") is paid. The Savings Bank does
not expect to be subject to the AMT.

Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters. The Company may exclude from its
income 100% of dividends  received from the Savings Bank as a member of the same
affiliated group of corporations.  The corporate dividends received deduction is
generally 70% in the case of dividends  received from unaffiliated  corporations
with which the  Company and the Savings  Bank will not file a  consolidated  tax
return, except that if the Company and the Savings Bank own more than 20% of the
stock of a corporation  distributing a dividend,  80% of any dividends  received
may be deducted.

Florida  Taxation.  The Savings Bank files Florida  franchise  tax returns.  For
Florida  franchise tax purposes,  savings  institutions are presently taxed at a
rate  equal to 5.5% of  taxable  income.  For  this  purpose,  "taxable  income"
generally  means  federal  taxable  income,   subject  to  certain   adjustments
(including the addition of interest income on State and municipal  obligations).
The  Savings  Bank is not  currently  under  audit with  respect to its  Florida
franchise tax returns.

                         IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING ISSUES

The FASB has issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 125 ("SFAS
125"). The statement provides  accounting and reporting  standards for transfers
and servicing of financial assets as well as extinguishments of liabilities. The
statement also provides  consistent  standards for  distinguishing  transfers of
financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. SFAS
125 is effective  for  transfers  and  servicing of financial  assets as well as
extinguishments of liabilities occurring in 1997. Management does not anticipate
SFAS 125 will have a material impact on the Company.

CORPORATE PROFILE

FFLC Bancorp,  Inc. ("FFLC" or the "Holding Company") became the holding company
for First Federal  Savings Bank of Lake County (the "Savings  Bank")  (together,
the  "Company")  on January 4, 1994 upon the Savings  Bank's  conversion  from a
federally  chartered mutual savings  association to a federally  chartered stock
savings bank.  The  acquisition  of the Savings Bank by the Holding  Company was

Dear Stockholders:

In each year's annual report, I like to mention some of the important events for
our Company during the past year, and reflect upon things we might expect during
the new year.

The year 1996  will be  remembered  as a very  important  year in our  Company's
history.  Significant  progress was made during the year in increasing  the loan
portfolio and total deposits of the Company's subsidiary,  First Federal Savings
Bank of Lake County.  For the year, the Bank's mortgage loan  originations  were
$74.4 million,  an increase of more than 48% above the prior year. Consumer loan
originations  totaled  $12.4  million,  for an increase of 101%.  All told,  the
Bank's loan portfolio at the end of 1996 stood at $236.9 million,  a gain of 26%
when  compared  to the end of 1995.  Deposit  growth was also  good,  with total
deposits  at year-end  being  282.7  million.  This  represents  a gain in total
deposits of $15 million, or 6%.

The single  largest  impact on our financial  statements  came from the one-time
payment all savings  institutions  were required to make to the Federal  Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In the case of First Federal, the required payment
to the FDIC was $1.7  million  ($1.0  million  after-tax).  In exchange for this
one-time  payment,  we expect First  Federal  will enjoy a 72%  reduction in its
deposit  insurance  premium in 1997. While the financial data within this annual
report fully reflects the cost of the one-time payment to the FDIC, I would like
stockholders to know what some of these figures would have been, absent the FDIC
payment.

Without the one-time  payment to the FDIC,  our Company's  earnings for the year
would have been $3.2  million,  or $123,000  more than 1995.  On an earnings per
share basis, the Company would have reported earnings of $1.25 per share, a 7.8%
increase  from the prior  year.  The  return on average  assets  would have been
0.96%,  the return on average  equity would have been 5.80%,  and the  operating
efficiency  ratio would have been  55.05%.  If we were to exclude  the  one-time
payment to the FDIC,  the Company's  price-to-earnings  ratio at year-end  would
have been 17.2.

During the year, the Company's Board of Directors conducted a strategic planning
session  in which  ways to  better  prepare  the  Company  for the  future  were
discussed.  The  greatest  challenge  for the Company is to produce a reasonable
return on equity. At year-end, the Company had a capital ratio of 15.48%. With a
capital  ratio at that  level,  it is  difficult  to produce a strong  return on
equity. The strategic planning session produced a plan of action that we believe
will better utilize the capital that we have and will produce  improved  results
in the future. It is worth noting that rather than one simple approach, the plan
of action addresses several areas.

First, we believe the repurchase of outstanding shares of stock should continue.
By the end of 1996,  FFLC  Bancorp  had  repurchased  a total of nearly  340,000
shares  of  stock.  In  January,  1997,  the  Board of  Directors  approved  the
repurchase of an additional  10% of the Company's  outstanding  shares,  or more
than 238,000 shares of stock.  By continuing to repurchase  stock,  we expect to
improve earnings per share.
<PAGE>
With our Company's  high level of capital,  we have the means to grow in several
ways.  We  recently  opened our third  branch  office  within the past  eighteen
months,  and we  continue to consider  locations  in which to open new  offices.
Growth can also occur by way of acquiring another financial institution. To date
that has not occurred, but it remains an alternative.


                                        4

<PAGE>
Our Company is also moving toward increased  involvement in commercial  lending.
Two local financial institutions in the Lake County market have recently sold to
out-of-state regional banks, and we believe the timing is right for us to become
more involved in local commercial  lending.  To that end, we recently brought on
board a commercial  loan officer with extensive  lending  experience in the Lake
County  area.  We believe  added  commercial  lending  will  diversify  our loan
portfolio,  and will  provide  us with new  opportunities  both in  lending  and
deposits.

Growth is also  possible  through  wholesale  transactions  in which the Company
finances the purchase of securities by borrowing the necessary  funds.  To date,
we have made two such  transactions,  and we have  maintained a positive  spread
between the earnings of the securities and the cost of the borrowing.

Looking to 1997, there are two important  events that will positively  influence
the Company's earnings.  First, as mentioned above, the Bank's deposit insurance
premium  rate has been  dramatically  lowered.  In addition,  the stock  benefit
program known as the  Recognition and Retention Plan (RRP) was fully expensed as
of the end of 1996.  Expenses  related to these two items will be  substantially
reduced during 1997.

The Bank's  newest branch  office,  located south of Leesburg at the Lake Harris
Square shopping center,  opened in February 1997. We believe continued expansion
of our branch network will provide long-term benefits to the Company. Of course,
by opening new branch  offices,  the  Company  increases  its current  expenses.
However, we believe that by undertaking the expense of new branch locations now,
we will be enhancing the  Company's  profitability  and franchise  value for the
future.

The performance of the Company's stock is of great  importance to  stockholders.
The price per share of FFLC  Bancorp's  stock began the year at $18.75 and ended
it at $21.50. When combined with the dividends paid during 1996, the result is a
total rate of return of 16.9%. FFLC Bancorp originally issued shares of stock at
$10.00 per share on January 4, 1994.  As of  December  31,  1996,  the stock has
enjoyed an  annualized  total rate of return of 31.6%  from its  initial  public
offering.

The directors,  officers and staff of FFLC Bancorp appreciate the support of our
stockholders  over the past three years. We are dedicated to profitably  serving
the banking needs of our local communities,  and to meeting the investment goals
of our  stockholders.  We firmly  believe  our  Company is on the right track to
accomplishing these goals.

Cordially yours,

Stephen T. Kurtz
President and Chief Executive Officer

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

First Federal Savings Bank of Lake County, the subsidiary of FFLC, was organized
in 1934 as a federally chartered savings and loan association and converted to a
federally  chartered  stock savings bank on January 4, 1994.  The Savings Bank's
principal  business  continues to be attracting retail deposits from the general
public and investing those deposits, together with principal repayments on loans
and investments and funds generated from operations, primarily in mortgage loans
secured by one-to-four-family,  owner-occupied homes, mortgage-backed securities
and, to a lesser  extent,  construction  loans,  consumer and other  loans,  and
multi-family  residential  mortgage loans.  In addition,  the Savings Bank holds
investments  permitted  by federal  laws and  regulations  including  securities
issued by the U.S. Government and agencies thereof.  The Savings Bank's revenues
are derived  principally from interest on its mortgage loan and  mortgage-backed
securities portfolios and interest and dividends on its investment securities.

The Savings Bank is a community-oriented  savings institution offering a variety
of  financial  services  to meet the needs of the  communities  it  serves.  The
Savings Bank's deposit gathering and lending markets are primarily  concentrated
in the  communities  surrounding  its full service  offices  located in Lake and
Sumter  counties in central  Florida.  Management  believes that its offices are
located in communities  that generally can be characterized as rural service and
retirement communities with residential neighborhoods comprised predominately of
one-to-four-family  residences.  The Savings  Bank is the oldest and largest (by
asset size)  locally-based  savings  institution in Lake County,  and serves its
market area with a wide selection of residential mortgage loans and other retail
financial  services.  Management  considers the Savings  Bank's  reputation  for
financial  strength and customer  service as a major advantage in attracting and
retaining  customers  in its  market  area and  believes  it  benefits  from its
community  orientation as well as its established deposit base and level of core
deposits.

The Savings Bank had net  earnings of $2.2  million for the year ended  December
31, 1996,  compared to net earnings of $3.1 million for the year ended  December
31,  1995.  At December  31,  1996,  the Savings Bank had total assets of $346.4
million, an increase of 6.3% over total assets of $325.8 million at December 31,
1995. That increase resulted primarily from a $44.5 million, or 24.3%,  increase
in loans  receivable  from $183.4 million at December 31, 1995 to $227.9 million
at December  31, 1996,  reflecting  increased  local loan demand.  Cash and cash
equivalents decreased $3.8 million or 27.1% from $13.9 million to $10.1 million.
Mortgage-backed   securities  also  decreased  $28.1  million  while  investment
securities  increased  $7.7 million for a net decrease of $20.4 million or 17.6%
in investment and mortgage-backed securities.  Deposits increased $15.0 million,
or 5.6%,  from $267.7 million at December 31, 1995 to $282.7 million at December
31,  1996.   Stockholders'  equity  decreased  $1.7  million  primarily  due  to
repurchases  of Holding  Company stock during 1996,  partially  offset by income
from operations.

REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

General

The  operating  results of the Savings  Bank are  affected  by Federal  laws and
regulations and the Savings Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination
and supervision by the Office of Thrift Supervision  ("OTS"),  as its chartering
agency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC"), as the deposit
insurer.  The Savings  Bank is a member of the Federal  Home Loan Bank  ("FHLB")
System and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable  limits by the FDIC
under the SAIF ("Savings  Association  Insurance  Fund").  The Savings Bank must
file reports with the OTS and the FDIC  concerning  its activities and financial
condition in addition to obtaining  regulatory  approvals prior to entering into
certain  transactions  such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial
institutions.  There are periodic  examinations  by the OTS and the FDIC to test
the  Savings  Bank's  compliance  with  various  regulatory  requirements.   The
activities of savings institutions are governed by the Home Owner's Loan Act, as
amended (the "HOLA") and, in certain respects, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
(the "FDIA").  The HOLA and the FDIA were amended by the Financial  Institutions
Reform,  Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") and the Federal Deposit
Insurance  Corporation  Improvement  Act  of  1991("FDICIA").  A  more  complete
description  of the HOLA and FDIA as amended by FIRREA and FDICIA is included in
the Form 10-K.

Capital Requirements

The OTS capital regulations  require savings  institutions to meet three capital
standards: a 1.5% tangible capital standard; a 3% leverage (core capital) ratio;
and an 8% risk-based  capital  standard.  Under the OTS final rule  implementing
FDICIA,  generally, a well-capitalized  institution is defined as one that meets
the following capital standards:  a 5% tangible capital standard;  a 6% leverage
(core capital) ratio; and a 10% risk-based  capital  standard,  and has not been
notified by its federal banking agency that it is in a "troubled  condition." At
December 31, 1996,  the Savings  Bank met each of its capital  requirements,  in
each  case  on  a  fully   phased-in   basis,   and  met  the   criteria   of  a
"well-capitalized" institution as defined above.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit
insurance  premiums  according to the level of risk involved in an institution's
activities. An institution's risk category is based upon whether the institution
is  classified as "well  capitalized,"  "adequately  capitalized"  or "less than
adequately  capitalized" and one of three supervisory  subcategories within each
capital group.  The supervisory  subgroup to which an institution is assigned is
based on a supervisory  evaluation and information  which the FDIC determines to
be relevant to the institution's  financial  condition and the risk posed to the
deposit  insurance fund.  Based on its capital and supervisory  subgroups,  each
SAIF member  institution  was assigned an annual FDIC  assessment  rate for 1996
between 23 basis  points  for an  institution  in the  highest  category  (i.e.,
well-capitalized  and  healthy) and 31 basis  points for an  institution  in the
lowest  category  (i.e.,  undercapitalized  and posing  substantial  supervisory
concern).  The Savings  Bank's  assessment  rate for 1996 was .23% of  deposits.
Effective January 1, 1997, the FDIC lowered the annual assessment rates for SAIF
members to 0 to 27 basis points,  as discussed  below. The FDIC has authority to
further raise premiums if deemed  necessary.  If such action is taken,  it could
have an adverse effect on the earnings of the institution.

                                        8
<PAGE>
On September  30,  1996,  legislation  was enacted  which,  among other  things,
imposed a special one-time assessment on SAIF member institutions, including the
Savings Bank, to  recapitalize  the SAIF and spread the obligations for payments
of Financing  Corporation ("FICO") bonds across all SAIF and Bank Insurance Fund
("BIF")  members.  The FDIC  special  assessment  levied  amounted to 65.7 basis
points on SAIF  assessable  deposits  held as of March  31,  1995.  The  special
assessment  of $1.7 million  before taxes was  recognized by the Savings Bank in
the  third  quarter  and is tax  deductible.  That  legislation  eliminated  the
substantial  disparity  between  the amount  that BIF and SAIF  members had been
paying for deposit insurance premiums.

Beginning on January 1, 1997, BIF members will pay a portion of the FICO payment
equal to 1.3 basis points on BIF-insured deposits, compared to 6.48 basis points
payable by SAIF members on SAIF-insured  deposits, and will pay a pro rata share
of the FICO payment on the earlier of January 1, 2000 or the date upon which the
last  savings  association,  such as the  Savings  Bank,  ceases to  exist.  The
legislation  also requires BIF and SAIF to be merged by January 1, 1999 provided
that  subsequent  legislation  is adopted to eliminate  the savings  association
charter and no savings associations remain as of that time.

Effective  January 1, 1997, the FDIC has lowered annual SAIF assessment rates to
0 to 27 basis points, a range comparable to those of BIF members,  although SAIF
members will continue to be subject to the higher FICO payments described above.
Management cannot predict the level of FDIC insurance  assessments on an ongoing
basis or whether the BIF and SAIF will eventually be merged.

Under the FDI Act,  insurance of deposits may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a
finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound  practices,  is in
an unsafe or unsound  condition  to  continue  operations  or has  violated  any
applicable law, regulation,  rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the
OTS. The management of the Savings Bank does not know of any practice, condition
or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

CREDIT RISK

The Savings Bank's primary  business is lending on residential  real estate,  an
activity  with  the  inherent  risk of  generating  potential  loan  losses  the
magnitude of which depend on a variety of factors affecting  borrowers which are
beyond the  control of the  Savings  Bank.  The  Savings  Bank has  underwriting
guidelines and credit review procedures designed to minimize such credit losses.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The  Company's  results of operations  are  dependent  primarily on net interest
income,   which  is  the   difference   between   the   income   earned  on  its
interest-earning  assets,  primarily its loans,  mortgage-backed  securities and
investment  securities,  and its  interest-bearing  liabilities,  consisting  of
deposits and borrowings. The Company's operating expenses principally consist of
employee  compensation,  occupancy expenses,  federal deposit insurance premiums
and  other  general  and  administrative  expenses.  The  Company's  results  of
operations are also  significantly  affected by general economic and competitive
conditions,  particularly changes in market interest rates,  government policies
and actions of regulatory authorities.

Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning
assets and expense on interest-bearing  liabilities. Net interest income depends
upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing  liabilities and
the interest rates earned or paid on them.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding
(i) the total dollar amount of interest and dividend  income of the Company from
interest-earning  assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar
amount of interest  expense on  interest-bearing  liabilities  and the resultant
average costs; (iii) net  interest/dividend  income; (iv) interest-rate  spread;
(v) net interest margin;  and (vi) weighted average yields and rates at December
31,  1996.  Yields and costs were  derived by dividing  income or expense by the
average balance of assets or liabilities,  respectively,  for the periods shown.
The average balance of loans receivable  includes loans on which the Company has
discontinued  accruing  interest.  The yields and costs  include  fees which are
considered to constitute adjustments to yields.

The following  table discloses the extent to which changes in interest rates and
changes  in  the  volume  of   interest-earning   assets  and   interest-bearing
liabilities  have affected the Company's  interest  income and interest  expense
during the periods  indicated.  Information  is provided in each  category  with
respect to (i)  changes  attributable  to changes in volume  (changes  in volume
multiplied by prior rate), (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes
in rate  multiplied by prior volume),  (iii) changes  attributable to changes in
rate/volume  (changes in rate multiplied by changes in volume), and (iv) the net
change. The changes  attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have
been allocated  proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due
to rate.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES

The Savings  Bank is required to  maintain  minimum  levels of liquid  assets as
defined  by  OTS  regulations.  That  requirement,   which  varies  periodically
depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows, is based upon a percentage
of deposits and  short-term  borrowings.  The current  required ratio is 5%. The
Savings Bank  historically  has maintained a level of liquid assets in excess of
the regulatory requirement.  Liquid assets consist of cash, cash equivalents and
short- and  intermediate-term  U.S. Government and government agency securities.
The maintenance of liquid assets allows for the possibility of disintermediation
when interest rates  fluctuate.  The Savings Bank's  liquidity ratios were 13.5%
and 13.8% at December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995, respectively.

The  Savings  Bank's  sources  of  funds  include  proceeds  from  payments  and
prepayments on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities,  proceeds from the
maturities of investment  securities,  sales of securities  and deposits.  While
maturities and scheduled  amortization  of loans and  investment  securities are
predictable  sources of funds,  deposit  inflows and  mortgage  prepayments  are
greatly  influenced by local conditions,  general interest rates, and regulatory
changes.

At December 31, 1996, the Savings Bank had outstanding  commitments to originate
$4.4 million of loans and to fund the undisbursed portion of loans in process of
$8.0  million.  The Savings Bank  believes  that it will have  sufficient  funds
available to meet its commitments. At December 31, 1996, certificates of deposit
which  were  scheduled  to mature in one year or less  totaled  $135.6  million.
Management  believes,  based on past experience,  that a significant  portion of
these funds will remain with the Savings Bank.

REGULATORY  CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS

As a federally-chartered  financial institution, the Savings Bank is required to
maintain certain minimum amounts of regulatory  capital.  Regulatory  capital is
not a valuation  allowance and has not been created by charges against earnings.
The following table is a summary of the capital requirements, the Savings Bank's
regulatory capital and the amounts in excess at December 31, 1996:

ASSET /LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

The Savings  Bank's  primary  mission is to provide  home  ownership by offering
permanent and construction residential mortgage loans and consumer financing and
by  providing  conveniently  located  depository  facilities  with  transaction,
savings and certificate accounts. The Savings Bank's goal is to continue to be a
well-capitalized   and  profitable  operation  that  provides  service  that  is
professional,  efficient  and  courteous.  The Savings Bank seeks to fulfill its
mission and  accomplish  its goals by pursuing  the  following  strategies:  (i)
emphasizing lending in the one-to-four-family  residential mortgage market; (ii)
controlling interest-rate risk; (iii) managing deposit pricing and asset growth;
(iv) emphasizing cost control; and (v) maintaining asset quality by investing in
mortgage-backed  securities which, in management's  judgment,  provide a balance
between  yield  and  safety  in  a  home  mortgage  related  investment.  It  is
management's   intention  to  continue  to  employ  these  strategies  over  the
foreseeable future.

The Savings Bank's profitability,  like that of most financial institutions,  is
dependent  to a  large  extent  upon  its  net  interest  income,  which  is the
difference  between its  interest  income on  interest-earning  assets,  such as
loans,  mortgage-backed  securities and investment securities,  and its interest
expense on interest-bearing  liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings.
Financial  institutions  continue to be affected by general changes in levels of
interest rates and other economic factors beyond their control.  At December 31,
1996, the Savings  Bank's  one-year  interest  sensitivity  gap (the  difference
between the amount of  interest-earning  assets anticipated by the Savings Bank,
based on  certain  assumptions,  to mature or  reprice  within  one year and the
amount of interest-bearing liabilities anticipated by the Savings Bank, based on
certain  assumptions,  to mature or reprice  within one year) as a percentage of
total assets was a positive 5.64%. Generally, an institution with a positive gap
would  experience  an  increase  in net  interest  income  in a period of rising
interest rates.  However,  certain  shortcomings are inherent in the sensitivity
analysis  presented above. For example,  although certain assets and liabilities
may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different
manners to changes in market  interest  rates.  Therefore,  no assurance  can be
given  that the  Savings  Bank will be able to  maintain  its net  interest-rate
spread as market interest rates fluctuate.

The Savings Bank  monitors its  interest  rate risk through the  Asset/Liability
Committee  which  meets  weekly  and  reports  the  results  of such  monitoring
quarterly to the Board of  Directors.  The Savings  Bank's  policy is to seek to
maintain  a  balance  between   interest-earning   assets  and  interest-bearing
liabilities so that the Savings Bank's cumulative one-year gap ratio is within a
range  which  management  believes is  conducive  to  maintaining  profitability
without incurring undue risk. Considering the current interest rate environment,
the Savings Bank has increased its  investment  in  adjustable-rate  and shorter
average life,  fixed-rate  mortgage-related  securities and, generally,  has not
retained in its portfolio 30 year fixed-rate  loans, in order to position itself
against  the  consequences  of rising  interest  rates.  The  Savings  Bank also
maintains  liquid assets in excess of the regulatory  requirement,  allowing for
the possibility of disintermediation when interest rates fluctuate.  The Savings
Bank's  liquidity  ratio of 13.5% at December 31, 1996 is  significantly  higher
than the  regulatory  requirement  of 5%. In addition,  the Savings Bank's large
stable core deposit base  resulting  from its  continuing  commitment to quality
customer service has historically provided it with a steady source of funds.

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO DECEMBER 31, 1995

General Operating Results.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 1996, was
    $2.2  million or $.85 per share,  compared  to net income for the year ended
    December  31, 1995 of $3.1  million or $1.16 per share.  The decrease in net
    income  was  primarily  the  result  of  the  effect  of the  one-time  SAIF
    assessment of $1.7 million before taxes,  included in  noninterest  expense,
    partially  offset by an increase of $949,000 in net interest  income  before
    provision for loan losses.

Interest Income.  Interest  income  increased  $1.7 million,  or 7.7% from $22.5
    million for the year ended  December 31, 1995 to $24.2  million for the year
    ended  December 31, 1996. The increase was due to an increase in the average
    balance of total  interest-earning  assets from $307.7  million for the year
    ended  December 31, 1995 to $321.9  million for the year ended  December 31,
    1996, an increase of $14.2  million,  or 4.6%,  primarily as a result of new
    branch  openings,  and an increase in the average yield on  interest-earning
    assets from 7.31% for the year ended December 31, 1995 to 7.52% for the year
    ended  December 31, 1996.  The yield on loans  decreased  from 8.43% for the
    year ended  December 31, 1995 to 8.33% for the year ended December 31, 1996.
    The yield on  mortgage-backed  securities  increased from 6.01% for the year
    ended  December 31, 1995 to 6.25% for the year ended  December 31, 1996. The
    yield on investment  securities and other interest  earning assets decreased
    from 6.12% for the year ended  December 31, 1995 to 6.00% for the year ended
    December 31, 1996.

Interest  Expense.  Interest  expense  increased  $776,000 from $12.2 million at
    December 31, 1995 to $13.0  million at December  31,  1996,  as the weighted
    average  rate paid on  interest-bearing  liabilities  increased  from  4.71%
    during 1995 to 4.72% in 1996.

Net Interest Income Before Provision for Loan Losses. Net interest income before
    provision for loan losses increased  $949,000 or 9.2% from $10.3 million for
    the year ended December 31, 1995 to $11.3 million for the comparable  period
    ended December 31, 1996.

Provision  for Loan  Losses.  The  Savings  Bank's  provision  for  loan  losses
    decreased from $124,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995 to $107,000 for
    the year ended  December  31,  1996.  The  decrease of $17,000  reflects the
    Savings Bank's continuing policy of evaluating the adequacy of its allowance
    for loan  losses  and  prevailing  standards  within  the  thrift  industry.
    Generally,   such  evaluation   includes   consideration  of  the  level  of
    nonperforming loans and the level and composition of the Savings Bank's loan
    portfolio.

Noninterest  Income.  Noninterest  income  increased  from $709,000 for the year
    ended  December 31, 1995 to $809,000  for the year ended  December 31, 1996.
    The  increase  was due to an increase in other  service  charges and fees of
    $93,000, and deposit account fees of $12,000 for the year ended December 31,
    1996.
<PAGE>

Noninterest  Expense.  Noninterest  expense  consists  primarily of salaries and
    employee  benefits,   occupancy  expense  and  deposit  insurance  premiums.
    Noninterest  expense  increased $2.4 million for the year ended December 31,
    1996 compared to 1995.  That increase was primarily due to the one-time SAIF
    recapitalization  expense of $1.7  million and  increases  in  salaries  and
    employee benefits of $356,000 and occupancy expense of $233,000,  due to the
    opening of two new branches.  The  remaining  items in  noninterest  expense
    increased $136,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996 compared to the year
    ended December 31, 1995 primarily due to the growth of the Company.

Provision for Income  Taxes.  The  provision  for federal and state income taxes
    decreased  from $1.9  million for the year ended  December  31, 1995 to $1.5
    million  for the year  ended  December  31,  1996.  The  effective  tax rate
    decreased  from 38.4% for the year ended  December 31, 1995 to 40.4% for the
    year ended December 31, 1996.

COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 TO DECEMBER 31, 1994

General Operating Results.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 1995, was
    $3.1  million or $1.16 per share,  compared to net income for the year ended
    December  31, 1994 of $3.6  million or $1.35 per share.  The decrease in net
    income was due to an increase in noninterest  expense of $662,000  partially
    offset by an increase of $89,000 in net interest income before provision for
    loan losses.

Interest Income.  Interest  income  increased $3.0 million,  or 15.5% from $19.5
    million for the year ended  December 31, 1994 to $22.5  million for the year
    ended  December 31, 1995.  The increase was due  primarily to an increase in
    the average balance of total interest-earning assets from $292.4 million for
    the year  ended  December  31,  1994 to $307.7  million  for the year  ended
    December 31, 1995, an increase of $15.3 million,  or 5.2%.  That increase is
    primarily  the result of new branch  openings and an increase in the average
    yield on interest-earning  assets from 6.66% for the year ended December 31,
    1994 to 7.31% for the year  ended  December  31,  1995.  The 65 basis  point
    increase represented a 9.8% increase and was primarily due to an increase in
    interest rates on loans and mortgage-backed  securities.  The yield on loans
    increased  from 8.31% for the year ended  December 31, 1994 to 8.43% for the
    year  ended  December  31,  1995.  The yield on  mortgage-backed  securities
    increased  from 5.40% for the year ended  December 31, 1994 to 6.01% for the
    year ended  December 31, 1995 because of increases in the rates at which new
    loans  were  originated  and  existing  ARM  loans  repriced.  The  yield on
    investment securities and other interest earning assets increased from 5.03%
    for the year ended  December  31, 1994 to 6.12% for the year ended  December
    31, 1995.

Interest Expense.  Interest expense  increased $2.9 million from $9.3 million at
    December  31,  1994 to $12.2  million at December  31, 1995 as the  weighted
    average  rate paid on  interest-bearing  liabilities  increased  from  3.78%
    during 1994 to 4.71% in 1995.

Net Interest Income Before Provision for Loan Losses. Net interest income before
    provision for loan losses  increased  $89,000 or .87% from $10.2 million for
    the year ended December 31, 1994 to $10.3 million for the comparable  period
    ended December 31, 1995.

Provision  for Loan  Losses.  The  Savings  Bank's  provision  for  loan  losses
    decreased from $138,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994 to $125,000 for
    the year ended  December  31,  1995.  The  decrease of $13,000  reflects the
    Savings Bank's continuing policy of evaluating the adequacy of its allowance
    for loan  losses  and  prevailing  standards  within  the  thrift  industry.
    Generally,   such  evaluation   includes   consideration  of  the  level  of
    nonperforming loans and the level and composition of the Savings Bank's loan
    portfolio.

Noninterest  Income.  Noninterest  income  increased  from $647,000 for the year
    ended  December 31, 1994 to $709,000  for the year ended  December 31, 1995.
    The  increase  was due to an increase in other  service  charges and fees of
    $55,000, and deposit account fees of $26,000 for the year ended December 31,
    1995 as compared to 1994,  partially  offset by a gain on sale of investment
    securities  available-for-sale of $27,000 during the year ended December 31,
    1994 compared to none during the year ended December 31, 1995.

Noninterest  Expense.   Noninterest   expenses  consist  primarily  of  employee
    compensation  and  benefits,   occupancy  and  equipment  expense  and  FDIC
    insurance  premiums.  Noninterest  expenses  increased $662,000 for the year
    ended December 31, 1995 compared to 1994.  Compensation and benefits expense
    increased  from $3.0  million for the year ended  December  31, 1994 to $3.4
    million  for the year ended  December  31,  1995,  primarily  related to the
    growth of the Company and normal salary  increases.  The remaining  items in
    noninterest expenses increased $238,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995
    compared to the year ended  December 31, 1994 primarily due to the growth of
    the Company.

Provision for Income  Taxes.  The  provision  for federal and state income taxes
    remained  substantially  the same and was $1.9  million  for the years ended
    December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1995.  The effective  tax rate  increased
    from 35.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1994 to 38.4% for the year ended
    December 31, 1995.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Consolidated  Financial  Statements and Notes thereto  presented herein have
been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP,  which  requires  the  measurement  of
financial  position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering the changes in the relative  purchasing power of money over time due
to inflation.  The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the
Savings Bank's  operations.  Unlike most  industrial  companies,  nearly all the
assets and liabilities of the Savings Bank are monetary in nature.  As a result,
interest rates have a greater impact on the Savings Bank's  performance  than do
the effects of general levels of inflation.  Interest  rates do not  necessarily
move in the same  direction  or to the same  extent  as the  price of goods  and
services.

FUTURE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS

The FASB has issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 125 ("SFAS
125"). The statement provides  accounting and reporting  standards for transfers
and servicing of financial assets as well as extinguishments of liabilities. The
statement also provides  consistent  standards for  distinguishing  transfers of
financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. SFAS
125 is effective  for  transfers  and  servicing of financial  assets as well as
extinguishments of liabilities occurring in 1997. Management does not anticipate
SFAS 125 will have a material impact on the Company.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
                        December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
    FFLC Bancorp,  Inc. (the "Holding  Company") was incorporated in Delaware on
    September  16,  1993 as a unitary  savings  and loan  holding  company.  The
    Holding Company  completed its public offering of 2,761,819 shares of common
    stock on January 4, 1994 and  acquired  First  Federal  Savings Bank of Lake
    County (the "Savings Bank") in connection with the Savings Bank's conversion
    from   a    federally-chartered    mutual    savings    association   to   a
    federally-chartered stock savings bank. The Holding Company's acquisition of
    the Savings Bank was  accounted  for as a  pooling-of-interest.  The Savings
    Bank was  established  in 1934 as a  federally-chartered  mutual savings and
    loan  association.   The  Savings  Bank  is  a  community-oriented   savings
    institution which offers a variety of financial  services to individuals and
    businesses primarily located in Lake County and Sumter County,  Florida. The
    deposits of the Savings  Bank are insured by the Federal  Deposit  Insurance
    Corporation   ("FDIC")  through  the  Savings  Association   Insurance  Fund
    ("SAIF").

    Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated  financial statements include
    the  accounts of the Holding  Company,  the  Savings  Bank,  and the Savings
    Bank's  wholly-owned  subsidiary,   Lake  County  Service  Corporation  (the
    "Service  Corporation").   All  significant  intercompany  transactions  and
    balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

    General. The accounting and reporting policies of FFLC Bancorp, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries  (together,   the  "Company")  conform  to  generally  accepted
    accounting  principles and to general  practices within the thrift industry.
    The following summarizes significant accounting policies of the Company.

    Estimates.  The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with
    generally  accepted  accounting   principles  requires  management  to  make
    estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date
    of the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

    Cash  and  Cash  Equivalents.   For  the  purpose  of  presentation  in  the
    consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are defined
    as those  amounts  included  in the  balance-sheet  caption  "cash  and cash
    equivalents."

    The Savings Bank is required to maintain  certain average  reserve  balances
    pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. These balances must be
    maintained in the form of vault cash or  noninterest  bearing  deposits at a
    Federal Reserve Bank. The Savings Bank exceeded this requirement,  which was
    $680,000 and $550,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

    Trading Securities.  Securities which are held principally for resale in the
    near term are  classified  as trading  and  carried  at their  fair  values.
    Unrealized gains and losses on trading  securities are included  immediately
    in income.
<PAGE>
    Securities  Held to  Maturity.  Securities  for  which the  Company  has the
    positive  intent  and  ability to hold to  maturity  are  reported  at cost,
    adjusted for premiums and discounts that are  recognized in interest  income
    using the interest method over the period to maturity.

    Securities  Available  for Sale.  Available-for-sale  securities  consist of
    securities  not  classified as trading  securities  nor as  held-to-maturity
    securities.







                                       25

<PAGE>
    Securities  Available  for Sale,  Continued.  Unrealized  holding  gains and
    losses, net of tax, on  available-for-sale  securities are reported as a net
    amount in a separate component of stockholders' equity until realized.

    Gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined
    using the specific identification method.

    Declines   in  the   fair   value   of   individual   held-to-maturity   and
    available-for-sale securities below their cost that are other than temporary
    have  resulted in  write-downs  of the  individual  securities to their fair
    value.  There were no such  write-downs  included  in  earnings  as realized
    losses during the three years ended December 31, 1996.

    Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest  income using the interest
    method over the period to maturity.

    Loans  Receivable.  Loans  receivable  that  management  has the  intent and
    ability to hold for the foreseeable  future or until maturity or pay-off are
    reported at their outstanding  principal  adjusted for any charge-offs,  the
    allowance  for loan  losses,  and any deferred  fees or costs on  originated
    loans.

    Loan origination fees and certain direct  origination  costs are capitalized
    and recognized as an adjustment of the yield of the related loan.

    The  accrual  of  interest  on  impaired  loans  is  discontinued  when,  in
    management's  opinion,  the borrower may be unable to meet  payments as they
    become  due.  When  interest  accrual is  discontinued,  all unpaid  accrued
    interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the
    extent cash payments are received.

    The  allowance  for loan  losses is  increased  by  charges  to  income  and
    decreased  by  charge-offs  (net  of  recoveries).   Management's   periodic
    evaluation of the adequacy of the  allowance is based on the Company's  past
    loan loss  experience,  known and inherent risks in the  portfolio,  adverse
    situations  that may affect the borrower's  ability to repay,  the estimated
    value of any underlying collateral, and current economic conditions.

    Foreclosed Real Estate.  Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu
    of, loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value
    at the date of foreclosure establishing a new cost basis. After foreclosure,
    valuations are  periodically  performed by management and the real estate is
    carried  at the lower of  carrying  amount or fair  value less cost to sell.
    Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation  allowance
    are included in the consolidated statements of income.

    Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently
    enacted income tax rates  applicable to the period in which the deferred tax
    assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.  As changes in
    tax laws or rates are  enacted,  deferred  tax  assets and  liabilities  are
    adjusted through the provision for income taxes.

    Premises and  Equipment.  Land is carried at cost.  The Company's  premises,
    furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements are carried at cost, less
    accumulated  depreciation  and  amortization  computed  principally  by  the
    straight-line method.

                                       26
<PAGE>
    Off-Balance  Sheet  Instruments.  In the ordinary  course of  business,  the
    Company  has  entered  into  off-balance-sheet   instruments  consisting  of
    commitments  to extend credit and  commitments  under lines of credit.  Such
    financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they are
    funded.

    Fair Values of Financial Instruments.  The following methods and assumptions
    were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments:

        Cash and Cash  Equivalents.  The carrying amounts of cash and short-term
        instruments approximate their fair value.

        Investment and  Mortgage-Backed  Securities.  Fair values for securities
        are based on quoted  market  prices.  If quoted  market  prices  are not
        available,  fair  value is based on quoted  market  prices  for  similar
        securities.

        Loans Receivable.  For variable-rate  loans that reprice  frequently and
        have no  significant  change in credit  risk,  fair  values are based on
        carrying  values.  Fair values for  certain  fixed-rate  mortgage  (e.g.
        one-to-four family  residential),  commercial real estate and commercial
        loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses,  using interest
        rates  currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers
        of similar credit quality.

        Federal  Home Loan Bank Stock.  Fair value of the Bank's  investment  in
        FHLB stock is based on its redemption  value,  which is its cost of $100
        per share.

        Deposit  Liabilities.  The fair values disclosed for demand,  NOW, money
        market and  savings  deposits  are, by  definition,  equal to the amount
        payable  on demand  at the  reporting  date  (that  is,  their  carrying
        amounts).  Fair  values  for  fixed-rate  certificates  of  deposit  are
        estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest
        rates   currently  being  offered  on  certificates  to  a  schedule  of
        aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.

        Borrowed  Funds.  The carrying  amounts of borrowings  under  repurchase
        agreements   approximate  their  fair  values.   Fair  values  of  other
        borrowings are estimated  using  discounted  cash flow analysis based on
        the Company's current  incremental  borrowing rates for similar types of
        borrowing arrangements.

        Accrued Interest.  The carrying amounts of accrued interest  approximate
        their fair values.

        Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments. Fair values for off-balance-sheet lending
        commitments  are based on fees  currently  charged to enter into similar
        agreements,  taking into account the remaining  terms of the  agreements
        and the counterparties' credit standing.

    Net Income Per Share of Common  Stock.  Net income per share of common stock
    has been computed  since the date of  conversion  from a mutual to a capital
    stock  company,  by  dividing  the net income  for the year by the  weighted
    average number of shares  outstanding.  Shares of common stock  purchased by
    the Employee  Stock Option Plan ("ESOP") and the  Retention and  Recognition
    Plan ("RRP")  incentive plans (see Note 17) are only considered  outstanding
    when the shares are released or committed to be released for  allocation  to
    participants.  The ESOP initially  purchased  220,945 shares, of which 2,630
    shares were released for allocation to participants  each month beginning in
    January,  1994. At December 31, 1996,  126,254 shares remain uncommitted and
    are not considered outstanding for purposes of the computation of net income
    per share of common stock. The RRP initially  purchased  110,473 shares,  of
    which 106,838 and 106,510 were allocated to participants  and are considered
    outstanding  for December  31, 1995 and 1996,  respectively.  The  remaining
    unallocated RRP shares were not considered outstanding during 1995 and 1996.
    For the year ended December 31, 1995 and 1996,  the weighted  average number
    of shares  outstanding  includes common stock equivalents (stock options-see
    Note 17) computed  using the treasury  stock  method.  The  following  table
    presents the calculation of net income per share of common stock:

    Future Accounting  Requirements.  The FASB has issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting   Standards  No.  125  ("SFAS  125").  This  Statement   provides
    accounting and reporting  standards for transfers and servicing of financial
    assets  as well as  extinguishments  of  liabilities.  This  Statement  also
    provides  consistent  standards  for  distinguishing  transfers of financial
    assets that are sales from transfers that are secured  borrowings.  SFAS 125
    is effective  for  transfers  and  servicing of financial  assets as well as
    extinguishments  of  liabilities  occurring  in  1997.  Management  does not
    anticipate SFAS 125 will have a material impact on the Company.

    Reclassifications.  Certain  amounts  in  the  1994  and  1995  consolidated
    financial  statements have been  reclassified to conform to the presentation
    for 1996.

    There were no sales of  mortgage-backed  securities  during the years  ended
    December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994.

    The Company's portfolio of mortgage-backed securities include collateralized
    mortgage  obligations  (CMOs).  CMOs are  generally  divided  into  tranches
    whereby  principal   repayments  from  the  underlying  mortgages  are  used
    sequentially  to retire the  securities  according  to the  priority  of the
    tranches.  The  Company  invests in the  following  collateralized  mortgage
    obligation  tranches:   sequential,  planned  amortization  class,  targeted
    amortization  class or support or  companion  floating-rate  tranches.  Such
    tranches have stated maturities ranging from 1-28 years; however, because of
    prepayments,  the  expected  weighted  average life of these  securities  at
    December 31, 1996 is approximately 2.1 years. The majority of the CMOs owned
    by the Company are insured or  guaranteed,  either  directly or  indirectly,
    through mortgage-backed  securities underlying the obligations by either the
    FNMA,   FHLMC  or  GNMA.   Depending   on  the   amount  of  the   Company's
    available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities,  fluctuations in the interest
    rate  environment  and other factors,  the Company may  experience  material
    effects on its capital  resources due to  categorizing  these  securities as
    available  for sale.  The Company's  CMOs may be subject to price  movements
    which typically  result from prepayment on the underlying  obligations.  The
    Company's  CMOs have  coupon  rates  ranging  from  4.00% to 7.51% and had a
    weighted  average rate of 5.91% at December 31, 1996. The Company  purchases
    only CMOs rated AA or better by nationally recognized rating services.

    There were no impaired  loans  recognized  under SFAS 114 and 118 during the
    years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995.

    The Company  originates or purchases  nonresidential  real  property  loans.
    These loans are  considered by management to be of somewhat  greater risk of
    uncollectibility  due to the  dependency  on  income  production  or  future
    development  of the real estate.  Nearly all of the Company's  real property
    loans were  collateralized  by real  property  in Lake and Sumter  Counties,
    Florida.

    Nonaccrual  loans  at  December  31,  1996  and 1995  totaled  $666,000  and
    $174,000,  respectively.  For the year ended  December  31,  1996,  interest
    income on loans  would  have been  increased  approximately  $23,000  if the
    interest on nonaccrual  loans at December 31, 1996 had been  recorded  under
    the original terms of such loans.  All of the  nonaccrual  loans at December
    31, 1996 were  first-mortgage,  single-family  residential loans or consumer
    loans.  There  have been no loans  restructured  during  any of the  periods
    presented.

(7)  Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank and Other Borrowings
    The $150,000 community  investment fund advance  outstanding at December 31,
    1996 and 1995 bears  interest at 7.17% and matures  February 28, 1997.  This
    advance was obtained in accordance  with the Community  Reinvestment  Act to
    provide lower interest rate  financing to developers of low-income  housing.
    The Savings Bank is required by its  collateral  agreement  with the Federal
    Home Loan Bank of Atlanta  ("FHLB") to maintain  qualifying  first  mortgage
    loans in an amount equal to at least 150% of the advance as collateral.  The
    Savings Bank has also pledged its FHLB stock for such advances.

    The Savings Bank also has $60 million of credit  availability  from the FHLB
    under the same collateral  conditions  discussed above. The Savings Bank did
    not draw  funds on this line of credit at any time  during  the years  ended
    December 31, 1996 and 1995.

    Retained  earnings at  December  31,  1996 and 1995  includes  approximately
    $5,810,000  for which no  deferred  federal  income tax  liability  has been
    recognized.  This  amount  represents  an  allocation  of income to bad debt
    deductions  for tax purposes  only.  Reduction  of amounts so allocated  for
    purposes  other  than  tax bad  debt  losses  or  adjustments  arising  from
    carryback of net operating losses would create income for tax purposes only,
    which would be subject to the then current  corporate  income tax rate.  The
    unrecorded   deferred   income  tax   liability  on  the  above  amount  was
    approximately $2,186,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995.

    The Small  Business Job  Protection  Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act") enacted on
    August 2, 1996 requires savings  institutions,  such as the Savings Bank, to
    recapture  certain  portions of their  accumulated  bad debt  reserves,  and
    eliminated  the  Percentage of Taxable  Income Method of accounting  for bad
    debts for tax  purposes.  The  Savings  Bank will be  required to change its
    method of  accounting  for bad debts for tax purposes  effective  January 1,
    1996. In addition, the Savings Bank will be required to recapture the excess
    of its bad debt reserves at December 31, 1995 over its base year reserves at
    December 31,  1987,  ratably over a six-year  period  beginning in 1996.  At
    December 31, 1996, the Savings Bank had  approximately  $900,000 of deferred
    tax liabilities  recorded for the recapture of its excess bad debt reserves.
    As provided  under the 1996 Act, the Savings Bank may defer the recapture of
    the excess  reserves  for tax purposes  for each of two  successive  taxable
    years in which  the  Savings  Bank  originates  a defined  minimum  level of
    certain residential loans. Management believes that the Savings Bank will be
    able to originate such minimum levels, and accordingly  expects to defer the
    recapture of the excess  reserves for the two years  allowed  under the 1996
    Act.

(9)  Pension Plan
    Prior to 1996, the Company participated in a multi-employer  defined benefit
    pension plan (the  "Pension  Plan") which covered  substantially  all of its
    employees. The Company's funding policy with respect to the Pension Plan was
    to make an annual  contribution  determined by the Pension Plan's  actuaries
    that would not be less than the minimum required  contribution,  nor greater
    than  the  maximum  federal  income  tax  deductible  limit.  The  Company's
    contributions for the Pension Plan for the years ended December 31, 1995 and
    1994 were  $65,000  and  $31,000,  respectively.  During  1996,  the Company
    decided to withdraw from participation in the Pension Plan, and accordingly,
    participants'  benefits were frozen and participants  became fully vested at
    that date. The Company did not make a  contribution  to the Pension Plan for
    1996.

    In connection with the above, the Company adopted a new defined contribution
    profit sharing 401(k) plan (the "401(k) Plan")  effective April 1, 1996. All
    employees who have met a minimum service requirement (1,000 hours of service
    in a  twelve-month  period) may  participate  in the Plan.  Under the 401(k)
    Plan,  a  participant  may  elect to  contribute  up to 15% of their  annual
    compensation,  subject to IRS limitations on total annual contributions. The
    Company will make contributions to the 401(k) Plan on a monthly basis at two
    percent of participants' compensation.  Contributions to the 401(k) Plan for
    the year ended December 31, 1996 were $23,000.

(10)  Financial Instruments
    The Company is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet risk
    in the  normal  course  of  business  to meet  the  financing  needs  of its
    customers and to reduce its own exposure to  fluctuations in interest rates.
    These  financial  instruments  are  commitments  to  extend  credit  and may
    involve,  to varying degrees,  elements of credit and interest-rate  risk in
    excess of the amount  recognized  in the  consolidated  balance  sheet.  The
    contract amounts of these instruments  reflect the extent of involvement the
    Company has in these financial instruments.

    The Company's  exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
    other party to the financial  instrument for commitments to extend credit is
    represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses
    the  same   credit   policies   in  making   commitments   as  it  does  for
    on-balance-sheet instruments.


                                       37
<PAGE>
    Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
    there  is no  violation  of  any  condition  established  in  the  contract.
    Commitments  generally  have  fixed  expiration  dates or other  termination
    clauses and may require  payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are
    expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do
    not necessarily  represent future cash  requirements.  The Company evaluates
    each customer's  credit  worthiness on a case-by-case  basis.  The amount of
    collateral  obtained if deemed  necessary by the Company  upon  extension of
    credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty.

    The estimated  fair values of the Company's  financial  instruments  were as

(11)  Significant Group Concentration of Credit Risk
     The Company grants real estate and consumer loans to customers primarily in
     the State of Florida with the majority of such loans in the Lake and Sumter
     County  area.   Therefore,   the  Company's  exposure  to  credit  risk  is
     significantly  affected  by changes  in the  economy of the Lake and Sumter
     County area.

     The contractual  amounts of credit related  financial  instruments  such as
     commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential  accounting
     loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer  default and the
     value of any existing collateral become worthless.

(13)  Commitments and Contingencies
    In the  ordinary  course of  business,  the Company has various  outstanding
    commitments  and  contingent  liabilities  that  are  not  reflected  in the
    accompanying  consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company is
    a defendant  in certain  claims and legal  actions  arising in the  ordinary
    course of business.  In the opinion of management,  after  consultation with
    legal counsel,  the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to
    have a material  adverse effect on the consolidated  financial  condition of
    the Company.

(14)  Restrictions on Retained Earnings
    The  Savings  Bank is  subject  to  certain  restrictions  on the  amount of
    dividends that it may declare without prior regulatory approval. At December
    31, 1996,  approximately $15 million of retained earnings were available for
    dividend declaration without prior regulatory approval.

(15)  Regulatory Matters
    The  Savings  Bank is  subject  to various  regulatory  capital  requirement
    administered  by the  federal  banking  agencies.  Failure  to meet  minimum
    capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory-and  possibly additional
    discretionary-actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
    material  effect  on  the  Company's  financial  statements.  Under  capital
    adequacy  guidelines  and the  regulatory  framework  for prompt  corrective
    action,  the Savings Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve
    quantitative measures of the Savings Bank's assets, liabilities, and certain
    off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
    The Savings Bank's capital  amounts and  classification  are also subject to
    qualitative judgements by the regulators about components,  risk weightings,
    and other factors.

    Quantitative  measures  established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
    require the Savings Bank to maintain minimum amounts (set forth in the table
    below)  of total and Tier I  capital  (as  defined  in the  regulations)  to
    risk-weighted assets (as defined).  Management believes,  as of December 31,
    1996, that the Savings Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which
    it is subject.

    As of  December  31,  1996,  the  most  recent  notification  from  the  OTS
    categorized  the  Savings  Bank as well  capitalized  under  the  regulatory
    framework  for  prompt   corrective   action.  To  be  categorized  as  well
    capitalized, the Savings Bank must maintain minimum tangible, tier I (core),
    tier I (risk-based) and total risk-based  capital ratios as set forth in the
    table.  There are no  conditions  or events  since  that  notification  that
    management believes have changed the institution's category.

    On September 30, 1996,  legislation  was enacted which,  among other things,
    imposed a special one-time assessment on SAIF member institutions, including
    the Savings Bank, to  recapitalize  the SAIF and spread the  obligations for
    payments of  Financing  Corporation  ("FICO")  bonds across all SAIF and BIF
    members. The FDIC special assessment levied amounted to 65.7 basis points on
    SAIF assessable  deposits held as of March 31, 1995. The special  assessment
    was recognized in the third quarter and is tax deductible.  The Savings Bank
    recorded  a charge  of $1.7  million  before  taxes as a result  of the FDIC
    special assessment.  That legislation  eliminated the substantial  disparity
    between  the amount  that BIF and SAIF  members  had been paying for deposit
    insurance premiums.

    Beginning  on January 1, 1997,  BIF  members  will pay a portion of the FICO
    payment equal to 1.3 basis points on BIF-insured deposits,  compared to 6.48
    basis points payable by SAIF members on SAIF-insured  deposits, and will pay
    a pro rata share of the FICO  payment  on the  earlier of January 1, 2000 or
    the date upon which the last savings association,  such as the Savings Bank,
    ceases to exist.  The legislation also requires BIF and SAIF to be merged by
    January 1, 1999 provided that subsequent legislation is adopted to eliminate
    the savings  association  charter and no savings  associations  remain as of
    that time.

    The FDIC recently lowered SAIF assessments to a range comparable to those of
    BIF members,  although  SAIF  members  will  continue to pay the higher FICO
    payments  described  above.  Management  cannot  predict  the  level of FDIC
    insurance  assessments  on an ongoing basis or whether the BIF and SAIF will
    eventually be merged.

(16)  Conversion to Stock Savings Bank
    The  Savings  Bank  successfully  completed  a  conversion  from a federally
    chartered mutual savings  association to a federally chartered stock savings
    bank on January 4, 1994  pursuant to the Plan of  Conversion  adopted by the
    Savings Bank's Board of Directors on June 17, 1993 and subsequently approved
    by regulatory  authorities and members of the Bank.  FFLC Bancorp,  Inc. was
    created  as the  holding  company  for  the  Savings  Bank  as  part of this
    conversion, generating proceeds of $23.3 million (net of shares purchased by
    the  Savings  Bank for  employee  stock  incentive  plans)  from the sale of
    2,761,819  shares of stock at the  price of $10 per share in a  subscription
    and community offering.

    The Plan of  Conversion  provided  for the  establishment  of a  Liquidation
    Account equal to the retained income of the Savings Bank as of September 30,
    1993 (the date of the most recent financial statement presented in the final
    conversion prospectus).  The Liquidation Account is established to provide a
    limited  priority  claim to the  assets of the  Savings  Bank to  qualifying
    depositors as of September 30, 1992 (Eligible  Account Holders) who continue
    to maintain deposits in the Savings Bank after  conversion.  In the unlikely
    event of a complete liquidation of the Savings Bank, and only in such event,
    each Eligible  Account Holder would receive from the  Liquidation  Account a
    liquidation  distribution  based  on their  proportionate  share of the then
    total remaining qualifying deposits.

    Current  regulations  allow the Savings  Bank to pay  dividends on its stock
    after the conversion if its regulatory  capital would not thereby be reduced
    below the amount then required for the aforementioned  Liquidation  Account.
    Also, capital  distribution  regulations limit the Savings Bank's ability to
    make capital  distributions  which include dividends,  stock redemptions and
    repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt
    and other transactions charged to the capital account based on their capital
    level and  supervisory  condition.  Federal  regulations  also  preclude any
    repurchase of the stock by the Savings Bank or its holding company for three
    years  after  conversion  except for  purchases  of  qualifying  shares of a
    director  and  repurchases  pursuant to an offer made on a pro rata basis to
    all stockholders and with prior approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision
    or pursuant to an open-market  stock  repurchase  program that complies with
    certain regulatory criteria.  See also Note 19 for information regarding the
    Savings Bank's Stock Repurchase Program.

(17)  Stock Benefit Plans
    During 1996,  the Company  adopted the  provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting  Standards No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation"
    ("SFAS No. 123"). SFAS No. 123 applies to stock-based compensation under the
    Company's  incentive  stock  option plan (the  "Option  Plan") and under the
    Company's Recognition and Retention Plan discussed below. As allowed by SFAS
    No. 123, the Company  elected to continue to measure  compensation  cost for
    the options or shares  granted under either plan using the  intrinsic  value
    method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
    Issued to  Employees."  SFAS No.  123 does not apply to the  Employee  Stock
    Ownership Plan discussed below.

    During the years ended  December 31, 1996 and 1995,  5,000 and 3,021 options
    were granted under the Option Plan,  and 3,600 and 2,709 shares were awarded
    under the  Recognition  and  Retention  Plan. If  compensation  cost for the
    Option Plan and the Recognition and Retention Plan had been determined based
    on the fair  value of the  awards at the grant  date,  using the fair  value
    method  defined in SFAS No. 123, the  Company's  net income and earnings per
    share for 1996 and 1995 would not have been materially reduced.

    Stock Option Plan.  During 1993,  the Company  adopted and the  shareholders
    approved the Option Plan. On January 4, 1994, upon conversion of the Savings
    Bank to a stock  association,  stock options for 276,182  common shares were
    authorized to be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Savings
    Bank including  39,801 shares  reserved for future  directors,  officers and
    employees.  Shares  granted  under the Option  Plan are  exercisable  at the
    market price at the date of grant.  Such incentive  stock options granted to
    officers and employees are  exercisable in three equal annual  installments,
    with the first  installment  becoming  exercisable one year from the date of
    grant. Options granted to outside directors are exercisable immediately, but
    any common  shares  obtained  from  exercise  of the options may not be sold
    prior to one year from the date of grant.  All options expire at the earlier
    of ten years from the date of grant or one year following the date which the
    outside director,  officer or employee ceases to serve in such capacity.  At
    December 31, 1996,  the Company is  authorized  to grant  options for future
    directors, officers and employees for 41,114 shares.

    Employee Stock  Ownership  Plan. The Company  sponsors a leveraged ESOP that
    covers eligible employees who have a twelve-month  period of employment with
    the Savings  Bank during which they worked at least 1,000 hours and who have
    attained age 21. The Savings Bank makes quarterly  contributions to the ESOP
    equal to the ESOP's debt service. The ESOP Trust purchased 220,945 shares of
    common stock in the Company's initial public offering with the proceeds from
    a loan from the Company.  This loan bears  interest at a  fixed-rate  of six
    percent with principal and interest payable in equal quarterly  installments
    over seven years.  The ESOP shares  initially were pledged as collateral for
    its debt.  As the debt is repaid,  shares are released from  collateral  and
    allocated to active  employees  based on the proportion of debt service paid
    during  the year.  The  Company  accounts  for its ESOP in  accordance  with
    Statement of Position 93-6. Accordingly, the debt of the ESOP is recorded as
    debt and the cost of the shares  pledged as  collateral  are  reported  as a
    contra equity account.  As shares are released from collateral,  the Company
    records compensation expense, and an offsetting credit to capital,  equal to
    the current  market price of the shares,  and the shares become  outstanding
    for  earnings  per share  computations.  Dividends  on all ESOP  shares  are
    recorded as compensation expense as it is management's intention to allocate
    the dividends along with the shares when allocated. Compensation expense for
    the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 included the following ESOP
    related costs:

    Recognition and Retention Plan. The Company  adopted,  and the  shareholders
    approved, an RRP for directors, officers and employees to enable the Savings
    Bank to attract and retain experienced and capable personnel.  On January 4,
    1994, the conversion date, 110,473 shares of common stock were purchased for
    the RRP which included 4,840 shares reserved for future directors,  officers
    and employees.  The shares are granted in the form of restricted stock to be
    earned in three equal annual  installments  beginning April 4, 1995. The RRP
    shares purchased in the conversion initially are excluded from stockholders'
    equity. The Company will recognize compensation expense in the amount of the
    fair  market  value of the common  stock at the grant date of $10 per share,
    pro rata over the years  during  which the shares are earned and payable and
    is  recorded  as a credit  to  shareholders'  equity.  Compensation  expense
    attributable  to the RRP  amounted to $368,000 in 1996,  1995 and 1994.  The
    shares are entitled to all voting and other shareholder rights,  except that
    the shares, while restricted,  cannot be sold, pledged or otherwise disposed
    of, and are required to be held in escrow.

    If a holder of  restricted  stock under the RRP  terminated  employment  for
    reasons other than death, disability, retirement or change of control in the
    Company, such employee forfeits all rights to any allocated shares which are
    still restricted. If termination is caused by death, disability,  retirement
    or  change  in  control  of  the  Company,   all  allocated   shares  become
    unrestricted. Forfeitures are reallocated to eligible participants annually.
    At December 31, 1996,  3,963 shares  remain  reserved for future  directors,
    officers and employees.

                          Independent Auditors' Report



The Board of Directors
FFLC Bancorp, Inc.
Leesburg, Florida:

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of FFLC Bancorp,
Inc. and Subsidiary (the "Company") (the parent company of First Federal Savings
Bank of  Lake  County)  as of  December  31,  1996  and  1995  and  the  related
consolidated statements of income,  stockholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year  period ended December 31, 1996.  These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of the Company as of
December 31, 1996 and 1995 and the results of its  operations and its cash flows
for each of the  years in the  three-year  period  ended  December  31,  1996 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
