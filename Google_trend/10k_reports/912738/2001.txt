ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Business

FFLC Bancorp,  Inc.,  ("FFLC" or the "Company") was  incorporated in Delaware on
September 16, 1993, and acquired First Federal  Savings Bank of Lake County (the
"Bank") in  connection  with the Bank's  conversion  to stock form on January 4,
1994. The Company is a savings and loan holding company subject to regulation by
the Office of Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS") which transacts its business  through
its subsidiary,  the Bank. At December 31, 2000, the Company had total assets of
$711.5 million and stockholders' equity of $59.3 million.

The Bank was  established  in 1934 as a  federally-chartered  mutual savings and
loan  association.  The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank  ("FHLB")
System and its deposit  accounts are insured to the maximum  allowable amount by
the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC").  At December 31, 2000, the
Bank had total  assets  of  $711.5  million  and  stockholders'  equity of $56.1
million.

The  principal  business  of the Bank is  attracting  retail  deposits  from the
general  public  and  investing  those  deposits,  together  with  payments  and
repayments  on loans  and  investments  and  funds  generated  from  operations,
primarily in mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family, owner-occupied homes,
commercial  real  estate  loans  and  securities,   and,  to  a  lesser  extent,
construction, commercial, consumer and other loans, and multi-family residential
mortgage loans.  In addition,  the Bank holds  investments  permitted by federal
laws and  regulations  including  securities  issued by the U.S.  Government and
agencies thereof.  The Bank's revenues are derived  principally from interest on
its loans and mortgage-backed  securities  portfolios and interest and dividends
on its investment securities.

Market Area and Competition

The Bank is a  community-oriented  savings  institution  offering  a variety  of
financial  services to meet the needs of the  communities it serves.  The Bank's
deposit  gathering  and  lending  markets  are  primarily  concentrated  in  the
communities  surrounding its full service  offices  located in Lake,  Sumter and
Citrus  counties  in central  Florida.  The Bank's  competition  for loans comes
principally from commercial banks,  savings  institutions,  and mortgage banking
companies.  The Bank's most direct competition for savings has historically come
from commercial banks,  savings  institutions and credit unions.  The Bank faces
additional  competition  for savings  from  money-market  mutual funds and other
corporate  and  government  securities  funds.  The Bank  also  faces  increased
competition for deposits from other financial  intermediaries such as securities
brokerage firms and insurance companies.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates.
The Company's market risk arises primarily from  interest-rate  risk inherent in
its lending and deposit  taking  activities.  To that end,  management  actively
monitors and manages its interest-rate risk exposure.  The measurement of market
risk associated  with financial  instruments is meaningful only when all related
and offsetting on- and  off-balance-sheet  transactions are aggregated,  and the
resulting  net  positions are  identified.  Disclosures  about the fair value of
financial instruments,  which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's  primary objective in managing  interest-rate  risk is to minimize
the  adverse  impact of changes  in  interest  rates on the Bank's net  interest
income and capital,  and to adjust the  Company's  asset-liability  structure to
obtain the maximum  yield-cost  spread on that  structure.  The  Company  relies
primarily  on its  asset-liability  management  to control  interest-rate  risk.
However,  a sudden and  substantial  increase  in interest  rates may  adversely
impact the  Company's  earnings to the extent that the  interest  rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed,  to the same extent,  or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

Lending Activities

Loan  Portfolio.  The Bank's loan portfolio  consists  primarily of conventional
first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family  residences.  At December 31,
2000, the Bank's total gross loans  outstanding  were $630.4  million,  of which
$409.6   million  or  64.96%  of  the   Bank's   total   loan   portfolio   were
one-to-four-family  residential first mortgage loans. Of the  one-to-four-family
residential  mortgage  loans  outstanding  at that date,  34.80% were fixed rate
loans  and  65.20%  were  adjustable-rate  ("ARM")  loans.  At  the  same  date,
commercial  real estate  loans and other loans on improved  real estate  totaled
$79.7  million,  or 12.65% of the  Bank's  total  loan  portfolio;  construction
(excluding construction/permanent loans) and land loans totaled $13.0 million or
2.06% of the Bank's  total  loan  portfolio;  and  multi-family  mortgage  loans
totaled  $17.6  million or 2.79% of the Bank's total loan  portfolio.  Consumer,
commercial and other loans held by the Bank, which  principally  consist of home
equity loans,  deposit,  consumer,  commercial  and other loans,  totaled $110.5
million or 17.53% of the Bank's total loan portfolio at December 31, 2000.

Purchase of Mortgage Loans. From time to time, the Bank purchases mortgage loans
originated by other  lenders but has not purchased any mortgage  loans in recent
years.  At December 31,  2000,  $1.5  million,  or .24% of the Bank's total loan
portfolio  consisted  of  purchased  mortgage  loans  or  loan   participations.
Purchased  mortgage loans consist  primarily of  one-to-four-family  residential
mortgage loans.

Secondary  Market  Activities.  The Bank  participates  in the secondary  market
through a  correspondent  relationship,  originating  loans  (primarily  30-year
fixed-rate loans) which are funded by the investor correspondent. Funding by the
correspondent eliminates the Bank's interest-rate risk on such loans. Such loans
are  closed  on the  Bank's  documents  with  funds  provided  by  the  investor
correspondent at closing with all credit conditions  established by the investor
correspondent  being satisfied prior to the issuance of a loan  commitment.  The
Bank  receives  a fee for  originating,  processing  and  closing  the loans and
reports  the loans to the OTS as loans  originated  and sold.  In the year ended
December 31, 2000,  such loans amounted to $1.1 million or .9% of total mortgage
loans originated.

Loan  Originations,  Sales and Principal  Repayments.  The following  table sets
forth the Bank's  loan  originations,  sales and  principal  repayments  for the
periods indicated.

One-to-Four-Family  Mortgage Lending.  The Bank's primary lending emphasis is on
the origination of first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four-family residences
within its primary  lending area.  Such  residences are primarily  single family
homes, including condominium and townhouses, that serve as the primary residence
of the owner.  To a lesser  degree,  the Bank makes loans on residences  used as
second homes or as investments. The Bank also offers second mortgage loans which
are underwritten applying the same standards as for first mortgage loans.

In the years ended  December 31, 1998,  1999 and 2000, the Bank's total mortgage
loan originations amounted to $119.5 million, $154.2 million and $123.4 million,
respectively,  of which  $107.4  million,  $136.5  million  and $106.2  million,
respectively, were secured by one-to-four-family properties.

At  December  31,  2000,   64.96%  of  total  loans   receivable   consisted  of
one-to-four-family residential loans, of which 65.20% were ARM loans. The Bank's
ARM  loans  may  carry an  initial  interest  rate  which is less than the fully
indexed rate for the loan. The initial discounted rate is determined by the Bank
in accordance with market and competitive factors. The Bank offers one-, three-,
and five-year ARM loans which adjust by a maximum of 2% per  adjustment  period,
with lifetime caps on increases of 5% to 6%, depending upon the program chosen.

The Bank's policy on one-to-four-family  residential mortgage loans generally is
to lend up to 80% of the appraised value of property securing the loan, or up to
95% if private  mortgage  insurance  is obtained on the amount of the loan which
exceeds 80%.

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending.  As of December 31, 2000, $79.7
million,  or 12.65% of the Bank's total loan  portfolio  consisted of commercial
real  estate  loans  and  $17.6  million,  or 2.79%  of the  Bank's  total  loan
portfolio, consisted of multi-family residential loans.

The commercial real estate loans in the Bank's  portfolio  consist of fixed-rate
and ARM loans which were  originated  at  prevailing  market  rates.  The Bank's
policy  has been to  originate  commercial  or  multi-family  loans  only in its
primary market area. Commercial and multi-family residential loans are generally
made in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property. In making such
loans,  the Bank primarily  considers the net operating  income generated by the
real estate to support the debt  service,  the  financial  resources  and income
level  and  managerial  expertise  of the  borrower,  the  marketability  of the
property and the Bank's lending experience with the borrower.

Commercial  Loans. As of December 31, 2000, $14.7 million or 2.33% of the Bank's
total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans.

Construction   and  Land  Loans.  The  Bank  originates  loans  to  finance  the
construction  of  one-to-four-family   homes  and,  to  a  much  lesser  extent,
originates loans for the acquisition and development of land (either  unimproved
land or improved  lots) on which the purchaser  can then build.  At December 31,
2000,  construction  (excluding  construction/permanent  loans)  and land  loans
totaled $13.0 million or 2.06% of the Bank's total loan portfolio.

At December 31, 2000, the Bank had loans in process  (undisbursed  loan proceeds
of construction loans) of $12.1 million which were mainly secured by residential
mortgages.  The Bank makes  residential  construction  loans to  homeowners on a
long-term basis with  amortization  beginning at the conclusion of construction,
usually  a  period  of  about  six  months.   Such  loans  are  carried  in  the
one-to-four-family  category and are not separately  classified as  construction
loans.   Residential   construction   loans  to  builders  are  carried  in  the
construction and land category.



                                       8
<PAGE>



Construction   and   land   loans   also   include    construction   loans   for
one-to-four-family  residential  property  for which the  borrower  will  obtain
permanent  financing  from  another  lender.  Such  loans  bear a fixed  rate of
interest that equals prime plus 1.0% during the  construction  period.  The Bank
obtains a commitment for the permanent  financing from the other lender prior to
originating the construction loan.

Consumer  Lending.  At December 31, 2000,  $95.8 million or 15.20% of the Bank's
total loan portfolio consisted of consumer loans, including home equity loans of
$28.4 million,  lines of credit of $9.5 million,  direct auto and truck loans of
$12.8 million,  indirect auto and truck loans of $20.8 million, home improvement
loans  and  other  secured  consumer  loans of $13  million,  lot loans of $10.4
million and unsecured personal loans of $933,000.


The Bank's home equity loans are  originated on  one-to-four-family  residences,
either on a  fixed-rate  basis with terms of up to 15 years or as balloon  loans
with terms up to five years with fifteen year amortization periods.  Those loans
are  generally  limited to aggregate  outstanding  indebtedness  on the property
securing the loan of 90% of the loan to value  ratio.  The Bank also offers home
equity lines of credit,  which bear prime-based  adjustable  interest rates with
terms up to fifteen years.  Such loans  generally  require  monthly  payments of
interest plus 1.5% of the balance outstanding.

Consumer loans are offered primarily on a fixed-rate,  short-term basis.  Except
for second  mortgage  loans which are  underwritten  pursuant  to the  standards
applicable to one-to-four-family  residential loans, the underwriting  standards
employed  by  the  Bank  for  consumer  loans  include  a  determination  of the
applicant's  payment  history on other debts and an assessment of the borrower's
ability to make payments on the proposed loan and other indebtedness.

Loan  Approval  and  Authority.  Mortgage  loan  approval  authority  for  loans
exceeding  $1,000,000  is vested in the  Executive  Committee of the Board which
meets weekly to consider loan  recommendations  of the Loan Committee.  The Loan
Committee is comprised of three outside directors,  the President and the Senior
Lending  Officers  of the Bank  and has  been  delegated  authority  to  approve
mortgage  loans,  home equity  loans,  home  equity  lines of credit and secured
consumer loans up to $1,000,000.

The Bank's  policy is to require  title and hazard  insurance on all real estate
loans, except home equity loans for which a title search is conducted in lieu of
obtaining title  insurance.  Borrowers may be permitted to pay real estate taxes
and hazard insurance premiums  applicable to the secured property for a mortgage
loan. In some  instances,  borrowers  may be required to advance funds  together
with each payment of principal  and interest to a mortgage  escrow  account from
which the Bank makes  disbursements for items such as real estate taxes,  hazard
insurance premiums and private mortgage insurance premiums.

Asset Quality

Delinquent  Loans  and  Nonperforming  Assets.  Loans  are  generally  placed on
nonaccrual  status when the  collection  of  principal or interest is 90 days or
more past due, or earlier if collection is deemed  uncertain.  The Bank provides
an  allowance  for  accrued  interest  deemed  uncollectible.  Accrued  interest
receivable is reported net of the allowance for uncollected interest.  Loans may
be  reinstated to accrual  status when all payments are brought  current and, in
the opinion of management, collection of the remaining balance can be reasonably
expected.

At December 31, 2000,  the Bank had no accruing  loans which were  contractually
past due 90 days or more as to  principal  and  interest  and no  troubled  debt
restructurings as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15.
Nonaccrual loans for which interest has been reduced totaled  approximately $2.5
million,  $2.4  million  and  $444,000  at  December  31,  2000,  1999 and 1998,
respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2000,  interest income that would
have been recorded under the original terms of nonaccrual  loans at December 31,
2000 and interest income actually recognized is summarized below (in thousands):

Classified  Assets.  Federal  regulations  and the  Bank's  policy  require  the
classification  of loans and other assets,  such as debt and equity  securities,
considered  to be of  lesser  quality  as  "substandard",  "doubtful"  or "loss"
assets. An asset is considered  "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by
the  current net worth and paying  capacity of the obligor or of the  collateral
pledged,  if  any.  "Substandard"  assets  include  those  characterized  by the
"distinct  possibility"  that the  institution  will sustain  "some loss" if the
deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the
weaknesses   inherent  in  those  classified   "substandard,"   with  the  added
characteristic  that the weaknesses  present make  "collection or liquidation in
full", on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, "highly
questionable and improbable."  Assets  classified as "loss" are those considered
"uncollectible"  and of such  little  value  that  their  continuance  as assets
without  the  establishment  of a specific  loss  reserve is not  warranted.  In
addition,  the Bank's policies require that assets which do not currently expose
the  insured  institution  to  sufficient  risk  to  warrant  classification  as
substandard  but possess other  weaknesses are designated  "special  mention" by
management.


                                       11

If an asset is  classified,  the estimated fair value of the asset is determined
and if that  value is less  than  the then  carrying  value  of the  asset,  the
difference is  established as a specific  reserve.  If an asset is classified as
loss, the amount of the asset  classified as loss is reserved.  General reserves
or  general  valuation  allowances  represent  loss  allowances  which have been
established to recognize the inherent risk  associated  with lending  activities
but, unlike specific reserves, are not allocated to particular assets.

The  following  table sets forth  information  concerning  the number and dollar
amount of loans  and real  estate  owned  classified  as  "special  mention"  or
"substandard"  at the  dates  indicated.  No loans  or real  estate  owned  were
classified "doubtful" or "loss" at those dates.

Allowance for Loan Losses.  The Bank's  allowance for loan losses is established
and  maintained  through  a  provision  for loan  losses  based on  management's
evaluation of the risk  inherent in its loan  portfolio and the condition of the
local  economy in the Bank's  market area.  Such  evaluation,  which  includes a
review of all loans on which full  collectibility may not be reasonably assured,
considers,  among other  matters,  the  estimated  fair value of the  underlying
collateral,  economic and regulatory conditions,  and other factors that warrant
recognition  in  providing  for  an  adequate  loan  loss  allowance.   Although
management   believes   it  uses  the  best   information   available   to  make
determinations  with respect to the Bank's  allowance  for loan  losses,  future
adjustments may be necessary if economic  conditions vary substantially from the
economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations
or if other circumstances change.

Investment Activities

The  investment  policy  of the  Bank,  which  is  established  by the  Board of
Directors and  implemented by the Chief  Executive  Officer who is designated as
the Investment Officer, is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity,
to generate a favorable return on investments  without  incurring undue interest
rate and credit  risk,  and to  complement  the Bank's  lending  activities.  In
establishing  its  investment  strategies,  the Bank  considers its business and
growth plans, the economic  environment,  the types of securities to be held and
other factors.  Federally  chartered savings  institutions have the authority to
invest  in  various  types  of  assets,  including  U.S.  Treasury  obligations,
securities  of various  federal  agencies,  certain  certificates  of deposit of
insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers acceptances,  repurchase
agreements,  loans on federal funds, and, subject to certain limits,  commercial
paper and mutual funds.

On January 1, 1994,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 115.  That  statement  requires  investment  and  mortgage-backed
securities  that the  Company  has the  positive  intent and  ability to hold to
maturity  to be  classified  as  held-to-maturity  securities  and  reported  at
amortized  cost.  Securities  that are held  principally for selling in the near
term are to be classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with
unrealized  gains and losses included in earnings.  Securities not classified as
either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are to be classified as
available-for-sale  securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses  excluded  from  earnings  and  reported in a separate  component  of
stockholders' equity.

The Company adopted FAS 133 effective July 1, 1999. As allowed by this standard,
the Company  reclassified  all securities  held to maturity with a book value of
$14,784,000  and a market value of  $14,969,000 to available for sale on July 1,
1999.

Mortgage-Backed Securities

The  Bank  invests  in   collateralized   mortgage   obligations   ("CMOs")  and
mortgage-backed  securities  such as government  pass-through  certificates.  At
December 31, 2000, the Bank's mortgage-backed securities portfolio totaled $14.4
million, or 2.02% of total assets. The mortgage-backed securities are not due at
a single maturity date, and accordingly, contractual maturity information is not
presented herein. CMOs, net of related premiums and discounts,  totaled $942,000
or 6.54% of total mortgage-backed securities.

CMOs are typically issued by a special purpose entity, which may be organized in
any  of  a  variety  of  legal  forms,  such  as a  trust,  a  corporation  or a
partnership.  The entity  combines pools of pass-through  securities,  which are
used to collateralize the mortgage related securities.  Once combined,  the cash
flows can be divided into  different  "tranches"  or  "classes"  of  securities,
thereby creating more predictable average lives for each tranch or class than is
provided  by the  underlying  pass-through  pools.  Under  this  structure,  all
principal  repayments  from the various  mortgage  pools can be  allocated  to a
mortgage-related  securities class or classes  structured to have priority until
it has been paid off.  Thus,  these  securities  are  designed  to  address  the
reinvestment  concerns associated with mortgage-backed  security  pass-throughs,
namely that they tend to pay off more  rapidly  when  interest  rates fall.  The
Bank's CMOs have  coupon  rates  ranging  from 7.25% to 7.56% and had a weighted
average yield of 7.36% at December 31, 2000.

The  Bank's  policy  is to  purchase  CMOs  rated  AA or  better  by  nationally
recognized  rating  services.  The  majority  of the CMOs  owned by the Bank are
insured or guaranteed  either  directly or indirectly,  through  mortgage-backed
securities underlying the obligations issued by FNMA, FHLMC or GNMA.

The Company's  mortgage-backed  securities  consist of securities  issued by the
Government  National  Mortgage  Association  ("GNMA"),  the  Federal  Home  Loan
Mortgage  Corporation  ("FHLMC") and the Federal National  Mortgage  Association
("FNMA").

                                       15

These  mortgage-backed  securities  totaled  $13.4  million  or  93.46% of total
mortgage-backed   securities.   Other  mortgage-backed   securities  consist  of
pass-through certificates issued by the FNMA, FHLMC or GNMA.

The  following  table  sets forth  mortgage-backed  security  purchases,  sales,

Sources of Funds

General. Repayments and maturities of mortgage-backed and investment securities,
loan  repayments,  deposits and cash flows  generated  from  operations  are the
primary sources of the Bank's funds for use in lending,  investing and for other
general purposes.

Deposits.  The Bank  offers a  variety  of  deposit  accounts  having a range of
interest  rates and terms.  The  Bank's  deposits  consist  of regular  savings,
non-interest-bearing  checking,  NOW  checking,  money  market  and  certificate
accounts.  Of the deposit  accounts at December 31, 2000, $41.0 million or 7.91%
consist of individual retirement accounts ("IRAs").

The Bank seeks to retain core  deposits  consisting  of passbook  and  statement
savings, money market,  noninterest-bearing  checking,  and NOW accounts,  which
contribute to a low cost of funds. Such core deposits  represented  26.2%, 25.5%
and 22.9% of total deposits at December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.

The following table shows the distribution of the Bank's deposits by type at the
dates indicated and the weighted-average nominal interest rates on each category
of deposits presented at December 31, 2000 (dollars in thousands).

Borrowings

The Bank is  authorized  to  obtain  advances  from the  Federal  Home Loan Bank
("FHLB") of Atlanta which are generally collateralized by a blanket lien against
the Bank's  mortgage  portfolio.  Such  advances may be made pursuant to several
different credit programs,  each of which has its own interest rate and range of
maturities.  The maximum  amount that the FHLB of Atlanta will advance to member
institutions,  including the Bank, for purposes other than meeting  withdrawals,
fluctuates  from time to time in  accordance  with the  policies  of the Federal
Housing  Finance Board and the FHLB of Atlanta.  At December 31, 2000,  the Bank
had $123 million in FHLB advances outstanding.

During 1997, the Bank entered into agreements with nationally recognized primary
securities  dealers under which the Bank sold  securities  subject to repurchase
agreements.  Such  agreements  were  accounted for as borrowings by the Bank and
were secured by the securities sold. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Bank did
not have any such borrowings outstanding.  During 1998, the Bank began borrowing
under retail repurchase  agreements with customers of the Bank. These agreements
are also accounted for as borrowings and are secured by securities  owned by the
Bank.

The  following  table  sets forth  certain  information  relating  to the Bank's
borrowings at the dates indicated:

Subsidiary Activities

The  Bank has one  wholly-owned  subsidiary;  Lake  County  Service  Corporation
("LCSC") formed to develop a 100-lot  subdivision,  which is substantially  sold
out.  During 1999,  LCSC sold an 8.4 acre  commercial  parcel and a one-acre lot
that  adjoins the Bank's  main  office.  The gain on the sale of the  commercial
property  was  $553,000  after tax and $886,000  before tax.  During 1999,  LCSC
purchased two commercial  building  sites for possible  future bank branches and
purchased an existing branch building in Inverness, which was rented to the Bank
as a branch site. The Inverness  branch  property was transferred to the Bank in
2000.

Personnel

As of February 15, 2001,  the Bank had 174 full-time  employees and 14 part-time
employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and
the Bank considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

General

As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is required by federal law to
file reports with, and otherwise  comply with, the rules and  regulations of the
OTS. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by
the OTS, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the deposit insurer.
The Bank is a member of the Federal  Home Loan Bank System and,  with respect to
deposit insurance, of the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") managed by
the FDIC.  The Bank must file reports with the OTS and the FDIC  concerning  its
activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals
prior  to  entering  into  certain   transactions   such  as  mergers  with,  or
acquisitions  of, other  savings  institutions.  The OTS and/or the FDIC conduct
periodic  examinations  to test the Bank's safety and  soundness and  compliance
with  various   regulatory   requirements.   This   regulation  and  supervision
establishes a comprehensive  framework of activities in which an institution can
engage and is intended  primarily for the  protection of the insurance  fund and
depositors.  The  regulatory  structure  also gives the  regulatory  authorities
extensive  discretion  in  connection  with their  supervisory  and  enforcement
activities  and  examination  policies,  including  policies with respect to the
classification  of assets and the  establishment  of adequate loan loss reserves
for  regulatory  purposes.  Any  change  in  such  regulatory  requirements  and
policies,  whether by the OTS, the FDIC or the  Congress,  could have a material
adverse  impact on the Company,  the Bank and their  operations.  Certain of the
regulatory  requirements  applicable to the Bank and to the Company are referred
to below or  elsewhere  herein.  The  description  of statutory  provisions  and
regulations  applicable to savings  institutions and their holding companies set
forth in this Form 10-K does not  purport to be a complete  description  of such
statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company.

Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a nondiversified  unitary savings and loan holding company within
the meaning of federal law. Under prior law, a unitary  savings and loan holding
company,  such as the Company was not  generally  restricted  as to the types of
business activities in which it may engage,  provided that the Bank continued to
be a qualified thrift lender. See "Federal Savings Institution  Regulation - QTL
Test." The  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act of 1999 provides that no company may acquire
control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the
financial  activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or
for multiple savings and loan holding companies as described below. Further, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley   Act  specifies  that  existing  savings  and  loan  holding
companies  may only  engage  in such  activities.  The  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act,
however, grandfathered the unrestricted authority for activities with respect to
unitary savings and loan holding  companies  existing prior to May 4, 1999, such
as the Company,  so long as the Bank continues to comply with the QTL Test. Upon
any non-supervisory acquisition by the Company of another savings institution or
Bank that meets the  qualified  thrift lender test and is deemed to be a savings
institution  by the OTS, the Company  would  become a multiple  savings and loan
holding company (if the acquired  institution is held as a separate  subsidiary)
and would  generally  be  limited to  activities  permissible  for bank  holding
companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act,  subject to the
prior approval of the OTS, and certain activities authorized by OTS regulation.


                                       22
<PAGE>


A savings and loan holding company is prohibited  from,  directly or indirectly,
acquiring  more than 5% of the voting stock of another  savings  institution  or
savings and loan holding company,  without prior written approval of the OTS and
from  acquiring or retaining  control of a  depository  institution  that is not
insured by the FDIC. In evaluating  applications by holding companies to acquire
savings  institutions,  the OTS considers the financial and managerial resources
and future prospects of the company and institution involved,  the effect of the
acquisition on the risk to the deposit  insurance  funds,  the  convenience  and
needs of the community and competitive factors.

The OTS may not approve any acquisition  that would result in a multiple savings
and loan  holding  company  controlling  savings  institutions  in more than one
state,  subject to two  exceptions:  (i) the approval of interstate  supervisory
acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a
savings  institution  in  another  state if the laws of the state of the  target
savings institution  specifically  permit such acquisitions.  The states vary in
the extent to which they  permit  interstate  savings and loan  holding  company
acquisitions.

Although savings and loan holding  companies are not subject to specific capital
requirements  or  specific  restrictions  on the payment of  dividends  or other
capital  distributions,  federal  regulations do prescribe such  restrictions on
subsidiary savings institutions as described below. The Bank must notify the OTS
30 days before declaring any dividend to the Company. In addition, the financial
impact of a holding  company on its  subsidiary  institution is a matter that is
evaluated  by the OTS  and the  agency  has  authority  to  order  cessation  of
activities or divestiture of subsidiaries  deemed to pose a threat to the safety
and soundness of the institution.

Federal Savings Institution Regulation

Business Activities. The activities of federal savings institutions are governed
by federal law and regulations.  These laws and regulations delineate the nature
and extent of the  activities  in which  federal  associations  may  engage.  In
particular,  many types of lending  authority  for  federal  association,  e.g.,
commercial,  non-residential real property loans and consumer loans, are limited
to a specified percentage of the institution's capital or assets.

Capital  Requirements.  The OTS capital regulations require savings institutions
to meet three minimum  capital  standards:  a 1.5% tangible  capital ratio, a 4%
leverage ratio (3% for  institutions  receiving the highest rating on the CAMELS
rating  system) and an 8%  risk-based  capital  ratio.  In addition,  the prompt
corrective action standards discussed below also establish, in effect, a minimum
2% tangible capital standard, a 4% leverage ratio (3% for institutions receiving
the highest  rating on the CAMEL  financial  institution  rating  system),  and,
together with the risk-based  capital  standard  itself,  a 4% Tier 1 risk-based
capital  standard.  The OTS  regulations  also  require  that,  in  meeting  the
tangible, leverage and risk-based capital standards, institutions must generally
deduct  investments  in and  loans to  subsidiaries  engaged  in  activities  as
principal that are not permissible for a national bank.

The  risk-based   capital  standard  for  savings   institutions   requires  the
maintenance of Tier 1 (core) and total capital (which is defined as core capital
and  supplementary  capital)  to  risk-weighted  assets  of at  least 4% and 8%,
respectively.  In determining the amount of  risk-weighted  assets,  all assets,
including  certain  off-balance  sheet assets,  are  multiplied by a risk-weight
factor of 0% to 100%,  assigned by the OTS capital regulation based on the risks
believed  inherent  in the type of asset.  Core  (Tier 1)  capital is defined as
common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings), certain noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock and related surplus,  and minority interests in equity
accounts  of  consolidated  subsidiaries  less  intangibles  other than  certain
mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships.

                                       23
<PAGE>


The components of supplementary  capital currently include cumulative  preferred
stock,  long-term perpetual preferred stock,  mandatory convertible  securities,
subordinated  debt and intermediate  preferred stock, the allowance for loan and
lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45%
of  unrealized  gains  on  available-for-sale  equity  securities  with  readily
determinable fair market values.  Overall,  the amount of supplementary  capital
included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital.

The  capital  regulations  also  incorporate  an interest  rate risk  component.
Savings institutions with "above normal" interest rate risk exposure are subject
to a deduction from total capital for purposes of calculating  their  risk-based
capital requirements.  For the present time, the OTS has deferred implementation
of the interest  rate risk capital  charge.  At December 31, 2000,  the Bank met
each of its capital requirements.

The following table presents the Bank's capital position at December 31, 2000.

                                                            Capital Ratios

Core (Leverage)       $ 55,470      21,340     34,130       7.80      3.00

Prompt  Corrective  Regulatory  Action.  The OTS is  required  to  take  certain
supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which
depends  upon the  institution's  degree of  undercapitalization.  Generally,  a
savings institution that has a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of
less than 8%, a ratio of Tier 1 (core) capital to  risk-weighted  assets of less
than 4% or a ratio of core  capital to total  assets of less than 4% (3% or less
for  institutions  with the  highest  examination  rating) is  considered  to be
"undercapitalized."  A savings  institution that has a total risk-based  capital
ratio less than 6%, a Tier 1 capital  ratio of less than 3% or a leverage  ratio
that is less than 3% is considered to be "significantly  undercapitalized" and a
savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less
than 2% is  deemed  to be  "critically  undercapitalized."  Subject  to a narrow
exception,  the OTS is  required  to appoint a receiver  or  conservator  for an
institution that is "critically  undercapitalized." The regulation also provides
that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OTS within 45 days of the
date a  savings  institution  receives  notice  that  it is  "undercapitalized,"
"significantly  undercapitalized" or "critically  undercapitalized."  Compliance
with the plan must be guaranteed  by any parent  holding  company.  In addition,
numerous  mandatory  supervisory  actions  become  immediately  applicable to an
undercapitalized   institution,   including,   but  not  limited  to,  increased
monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth,  capital  distributions and
expansion.  The OTS  could  also  take  any  one of a  number  of  discretionary
supervisory  actions,  including  the  issuance of a capital  directive  and the
replacement of senior executive officers and directors.

Insurance  of  Deposit  Accounts.  The Bank is a member  of the  SAIF.  The FDIC
maintains a risk-based  assessment system by which  institutions are assigned to
one of  three  categories  based  on  their  capitalization  and  one  of  three
subcategories based on examination ratings and other supervisory information. An
institution's  assessment  rate  depends  upon  the  categories  to  which it is
assigned.   Assessment  rates  for  SAIF  member   institutions  are  determined
semiannually  by the FDIC and  currently  range from zero  basis  points for the
healthiest institutions to 27 basis points for the riskiest.


                                       24
<PAGE>


In addition to the assessment for deposit  insurance,  institutions are required
to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing  Corporation
("FICO") to recapitalize the predecessor to the SAIF. During 1999, FICO payments
for SAIF  members  approximated  6.1 basis  points,  while Bank  Insurance  Fund
("BIF")  members paid 1.2 basis points.  By law,  there is equal sharing of FICO
payments between SAIF and BIF members beginning on January 1, 2000.

The Bank paid no assessment for 2000, however its payments toward the FICO bonds
amounted to $90,091. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A
significant  increase in SAIF  insurance  premiums  would likely have an adverse
effect  on the  operating  expenses  and  results  of  operations  of the  Bank.
Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.

Insurance  of deposits  may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a finding  that the
institution  has  engaged  in unsafe or  unsound  practices,  is in an unsafe or
unsound  condition to continue  operations or has violated any  applicable  law,
regulation,  rule,  order or  condition  imposed  by the  FDIC or the  OTS.  The
management  of the Bank does not know of any  practice,  condition  or violation
that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

Loans to One  Borrower.  Federal law  provides  that  savings  institutions  are
generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower  applicable to national
banks. A savings institution may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or
related  group of  borrowers  in excess  of 15% of its  unimpaired  capital  and
surplus.  An additional  amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired  capital
and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable  collateral. At December
31, 2000,  the Bank's limit on loans to one borrower was $8.9  million,  and the
Bank's  largest  aggregate  outstanding  loans and  extensions  of credit to one
borrower was $7.4 million.

QTL Test.  The HOLA requires  savings  institutions  to meet a qualified  thrift
lender test. Under the test, a savings association is required to either qualify
as a "domestic building and loan association" under the Internal Revenue Code or
maintain  at  least  65% of its  "portfolio  assets"  (total  assets  less:  (i)
specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets;  (ii) intangibles,  including
goodwill;  and (iii) the value of property used to conduct  business) in certain
"qualified  thrift  investments"  (primarily  residential  mortgages and related
investments,  including certain mortgage-backed securities) in at least 9 months
out of each 12 month period.

A savings  institution that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to
certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a bank charter.
As of December 31, 2000, the Bank maintained  77.97% of its portfolio  assets in
qualified  thrift  investments and,  therefore,  met the qualified thrift lender
test.  Recent  legislation  has  expanded the extent to which  education  loans,
credit card loans and small business loans may be considered  "qualified  thrift
investments."

Limitation on Capital Distributions. OTS regulations impose limitations upon all
capital  distributions  by a  savings  institution,  including  cash  dividends,
payments  to  repurchase  its shares and  payments  to  shareholders  of another
institution  in a cash-out  merger.  The rule  effective in the first quarter of
1999 established three tiers of institutions based primarily on an institution's
capital level. An institution that exceeded all capital  requirements before and
after a proposed capital  distribution  ("Tier 1 Bank") and had not been advised
by the OTS that it was in need of more than  normal  supervision,  could,  after
prior  notice  but  without   obtaining   approval  of  the  OTS,  make  capital
distributions  during the calendar  year equal to the greater of (i) 100% of its
net earnings to date during the calendar  year plus the amount that would reduce
by one-half the excess capital over its capital requirements at the beginning of
the calendar year or (ii) 75% of its net income for the previous four  quarters.

                                       25
<PAGE>

Any  additional  capital  distributions   required  prior  regulatory  approval.
Effective  April 1, 1999,  the OTS's capital  distribution  regulation  changed.
Under the new regulation, an application to and the prior approval of the OTS is
required prior to any capital  distribution if the institution does not meet the
criteria for "expedited  treatment" of applications under OTS regulations (i.e.,
generally,  examination  ratings in the two top  categories),  the total capital
distributions  for the  calendar  year  exceed net income for that year plus the
amount of retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would
be  undercapitalized  following  the  distribution  or  the  distribution  would
otherwise  be contrary to a statute,  regulation  or  agreement  with OTS. If an
application is not required,  the institution must still provide prior notice to
OTS of the capital  distribution  if,  like the Bank,  it is a  subsidiary  of a
holding  company.  In the event the Bank's  capital  fell  below its  regulatory
requirements  or the OTS  notified  it that it was in need of more  than  normal
supervision,   the  Bank's  ability  to  make  capital  distributions  could  be
restricted.  In addition, the OTS could prohibit a proposed capital distribution
by any institution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the
OTS  determines  that such  distribution  would  constitute an unsafe or unsound
practice.

Liquidity.  The Bank is  required  to  maintain  an  average  daily  balance  of
specified  liquid assets equal to a monthly average of not less than a specified
percentage of its net withdrawable deposit accounts plus short-term  borrowings.
This liquidity requirement is currently 4%, but may be changed from time to time
by the OTS to any amount within the range of 4% to 10%.  Monetary  penalties may
be  imposed  for  failure  to meet  these  liquidity  requirements.  The  Bank's
liquidity  ratio for December 31, 2000 was 10.3%,  which exceeded the applicable
requirements.  The Bank has never been subject to monetary penalties for failure
to meet its liquidity requirements.

Assessments.  Savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the OTS to
fund the agency's  operations.  The general  assessments,  paid on a semi-annual
basis,  are computed  upon the savings  institution's  total  assets,  including
consolidated  subsidiaries,  as reported in the Bank's latest  quarterly  thrift
financial  report.  The Bank was not  assessed  any payments for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000.

Transactions   with  Related   Parties.   The  Bank's  authority  to  engage  in
transactions  with  "affiliates"  (e.g.,  any company that  controls or is under
common control with an  institution,  including the Company and its  non-savings
institution  subsidiaries)  is limited by federal law. The  aggregate  amount of
covered  transactions  with any  individual  affiliate  is limited to 10% of the
capital and surplus of the savings institution.  The aggregate amount of covered
transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings  institution's
capital and surplus.  Certain  transactions  with  affiliates are required to be
secured by collateral  in an amount and of a type  described in federal law. The
purchase of low quality  assets from  affiliates  is generally  prohibited.  The
transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances,  that are
at least as favorable to the  institution  as those  prevailing  at the time for
comparable  transactions with  non-affiliated  companies.  In addition,  savings
institutions  are  prohibited  from lending to any affiliate  that is engaged in
activities that are not  permissible  for bank holding  companies and no savings
institution   may  purchase  the  securities  of  any  affiliate  other  than  a
subsidiary.

The Bank's authority to extend credit to executive  officers,  directors and 10%
shareholders  ("insiders"),  as well as entities such persons  control,  is also
governed  by  federal  law.  Such  loans  are  required  to  be  made  on  terms
substantially  the same as those  offered to  unaffiliated  individuals  and not
involve more than the normal risk of repayment.  Recent  legislation  created an
exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or  compensation  program that is
widely  available  to all  employees  of  the  institution  and  does  not  give
preference to insiders over other employees.  The law limits both the individual
and aggregate  amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders  based, in part, on
the Bank's capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be
followed.

Enforcement.  The  OTS  has  primary  enforcement  responsibility  over  savings
institutions  and has the authority to bring actions against the institution and
all institution-affiliated  parties, including stockholders,  and any attorneys,
appraisers and accountants  who knowingly or recklessly  participate in wrongful
action  likely to have an  adverse  effect  on an  insured  institution.  Formal
enforcement  action may range from the issuance of a capital  directive or cease
and desist  order to removal of officers  and/or  directors  to  institution  of
receivership,   conservatorship  or  termination  of  deposit  insurance.  Civil
penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or
even  $1  million  per day in  especially  egregious  cases.  The  FDIC  has the
authority to recommend to the Director of the OTS that enforcement  action to be
taken with respect to a particular savings  institution.  If action is not taken
by the  Director,  the FDIC has  authority  to take such  action  under  certain
circumstances.  Federal  law also  establishes  criminal  penalties  for certain
violations.

Standards for Safety and Soundness.  The federal  banking  agencies have adopted
Interagency  Guidelines  prescribing  Standards  for Safety and  Soundness.  The
guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking
agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions
before  capital  becomes  impaired.   If  the  OTS  determines  that  a  savings
institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OTS may
require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve  compliance with
the standard.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System,  which consists of 12
regional  Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central
credit facility primarily for member institutions.  The Bank, as a member of the
Federal Home Loan Bank,  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock
in that  Federal  Home  Loan  Bank in an  amount  at least  equal to 1.0% of the
aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential  mortgage loans and similar
obligations at the beginning of each year, or 1/20 of its advances  (borrowings)
from  the  Federal  Home  Loan  Bank,  whichever  is  greater.  The  Bank was in
compliance  with this  requirement  with an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank
stock at December 31, 2000 of $6.15 million.

The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for the  resolution of
insolvent  thrifts  in the late  1980s and to  contribute  funds for  affordable
housing programs.  These  requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that
the  Federal  Home Loan Banks pay to their  members and could also result in the
Federal Home Loan Banks  imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their
members. If dividends were reduced, or interest on future Federal Home Loan Bank
advances increased, The Bank's net interest income would likely also be reduced.
Recent  legislation  has changed the  structure  of the Federal  Home Loan Banks
funding obligations for insolvent thrifts,  revised the capital structure of the
Federal  Home Loan  Banks and  implemented  entirely  voluntary  membership  for
Federal Home Loan Banks. Management cannot predict the effect that these changes
may have with respect to its Federal Home Loan Bank membership.

Federal Reserve System


The Federal Reserve Board regulations  require savings  institutions to maintain
non-interest  earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW
and regular checking accounts).  The regulations generally provide that reserves
be maintained against aggregate  transaction  accounts as follows:  for accounts
aggregating  $44.3 million or less (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve
Board) the reserve requirement is 3%; and for accounts  aggregating greater than
$44.3  million,  the reserve  requirement is $1.329 million plus 10% (subject to
adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board between 8% and 14%) against that portion
of total transaction accounts in excess of $44.3 million. The first $5.0 million
of otherwise  reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve
Board) are exempted  from the reserve  requirements.  The Bank complies with the
foregoing requirements.

                           FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION

Federal Taxation

General.  The Company and the Bank report their income on a  consolidated  basis
using the  accrual  method of  accounting,  and are  subject to  federal  income
taxation  in the  same  manner  as  other  corporations  with  some  exceptions,
including  particularly  the Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed  below.  The
following  discussion  of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not
purport to be a  comprehensive  description  of the tax rules  applicable to the
Bank or the  Company.  The Bank was last  audited  by the IRS for the year ended
December 31, 1996.  For its 2000 taxable year,  the Bank is subject to a maximum
federal income tax rate of 34%.

Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning prior to December 31, 1995, thrift
institutions  which  qualified  under  certain   definitional  tests  and  other
conditions of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") were  permitted to
use certain  favorable  provisions to calculate  their  deductions  from taxable
income  for  annual  additions  to their bad debt  reserve.  A reserve  could be
established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans  (generally  secured
by  interests  in  real  property  improved  or to be  improved)  under  (i) the
Percentage of Taxable  Income  Method (the "PTI Method") or (ii) the  Experience
Method.  The reserve for  nonqualifying  loans was computed using the Experience
Method.

The Small  Business  Job  Protection  Act of 1996 (the  "1996  Act"),  which was
enacted on August 20, 1996,  requires  savings  institutions to recapture (i.e.,
take into income) certain portions of their  accumulated bad debt reserves.  The
1996 Act repeals the reserve  method of accounting  for bad debts  effective for
tax years beginning  after 1995.  Thrift  institutions  that would be treated as
small banks are  allowed to utilize the  Experience  Method  applicable  to such
institutions,  while thrift  institutions that are treated as large banks (those
generally  exceeding  $500  million  in  assets)  are  required  to use only the
specific charge-off method.  Thus, the PTI Method of accounting for bad debts is
no longer available for any financial institution.

A thrift institution required to change its method of computing reserves for bad
debts will treat such change as a change in method of  accounting,  initiated by
the  taxpayer,  and having  been made with the  consent of the IRS.  Any Section
481(a)  adjustment  required to be taken into income with respect to such change
generally  will be taken into income  ratably  over a  six-taxable  year period,
beginning  with the first  taxable  year  beginning  after 1995,  subject to the
residential loan requirement.

Under the residential loan requirement provision,  the recapture required by the
1996 Act is suspended for each of two successive  taxable years,  beginning with
1996, in which the Bank originates a minimum of certain  residential loans based
upon the average of the principal  amounts of such loans made by the Bank during
its six taxable years  preceding its current  taxable year.  Under the 1996 Act,
for its  current  and  future  taxable  years,  the  Bank is  permitted  to make
additions to its tax bad debt  reserves.  In  addition,  the Bank is required to
recapture  (i.e.,  take into  income)  over a six year  period the excess of the
balance of its tax bad debt reserves as of December 31, 1995 over the balance of
such  reserves as of December  31,  1987.  At December  31,  2000,  the Bank had
approximately $454,000 of deferred tax liabilities recorded for the recapture of
its bad debt reserves.


                                       29
<PAGE>



Distributions.   Under  the  1996   Act,   if  the  Bank   makes   "non-dividend
distributions"  to the Company,  such  distributions  will be considered to have
been made from the Bank's  unrecaptured  tax bad debt  reserves  (including  the
balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987) to the extent thereof, and then
from the Bank's supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent thereof,
and an amount based on the amount  distributed  (but not in excess of the amount
of  such  reserves)  will  be  included  in  the  Bank's  income.   Non-dividend
distributions  include  distributions  in  excess  of  the  Bank's  current  and
accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes,
distributions in redemption of stock,  and  distributions in partial or complete
liquidation.  Dividends paid out of the Bank's  current or accumulated  earnings
and profits will not be so included in the Bank's income.

The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount
that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount
of the distribution.  Thus, if the Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to the
Company,  approximately  one and one-half times the amount of such  distribution
(but not in excess of the amount of such reserves) would be includable in income
for federal  income tax purposes,  assuming a 35% federal  corporate  income tax
rate. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture
of any portion of its bad debt reserves.

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. The Code imposes a tax on alternative minimum
taxable income  ("AMTI") at a rate of 20%. For fiscal years  beginning  prior to
January  1,  1996,  the  excess  of the bad debt  reserve  deduction  using  the
percentage  of taxable  income  method over the  deduction  that would have been
allowable  under the  experience  method is  treated  as a  preference  item for
purposes of computing the AMTI.  Only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating
loss carryovers.  The adjustment to AMTI based on book income is an amount equal
to 75% of the amount by which a corporation's  adjusted current earnings exceeds
its AMTI  (determined  without regard to this  adjustment and prior to reduction
for net  operating  losses).  In addition,  for taxable  years  through 1995, an
environmental  tax of .12% of the  excess of AMTI (with  certain  modifications)
over $2.0 million is imposed on corporations, including the Bank, whether or not
an  Alternative  Minimum  Tax  ("AMT")  is paid.  The Bank does not expect to be
subject to the AMT.

Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters. The Company may exclude from its
income  100% of  dividends  received  from  the  Bank as a  member  of the  same
affiliated group of corporations.  The corporate dividends received deduction is
generally 70% in the case of dividends  received from unaffiliated  corporations
with which the  Company  and the Bank will not file a  consolidated  tax return,
except  that if the  Company  and the Bank own more  than 20% of the  stock of a
corporation  distributing  a  dividend,  80% of any  dividends  received  may be
deducted.

Florida  Taxation.  The Bank files Florida  franchise  tax returns.  For Florida
franchise tax purposes, savings institutions are presently taxed at a rate equal
to 5.5% of taxable income.  For this purpose,  "taxable income"  generally means
federal taxable income,  subject to certain adjustments  (including the addition
of  interest  income  on  State  and  municipal  obligations).  The  Bank is not
currently under audit with respect to its Florida franchise tax returns.

                                   OUR MISSION


Our mission is to operate First Federal  Savings Bank as a community  bank, in a
manner consistent with the high expectations of our shareholders,  customers and
employees.  We will achieve  attractive  financial results for our stockholders,
provide  quality  financial  services and products to our  customers,  and offer
rewarding  careers to our employees,  while maintaining a high level of personal
service and integrity. The Company's primary goals are to:

     o   provide  an  attractive  return to its  shareholders,  as  measured  by
         long-term capital  appreciation and the continued payment of reasonable
         dividends,

     o   provide a competitive,  progressive  and profitable  array of financial
         services  and  products,  in a manner  focused  on  excellent  customer
         service,

     o   attract and retain highly-motivated,  top-quality employees, and

     o   make a positive impact on the communities that we serve.


                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of  1995  evidences  Congress'
determination  that the disclosure of  forward-looking  information is desirable
for  investors  and  encourages  such  disclosure by providing a safe harbor for
forward-looking   statements  by  corporate  management.   This  Annual  Report,
including  the  Letter  to  Stockholders  and the  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis  of   Financial   Condition   and  Results  of   Operations,   contains
forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. In order to comply
with the terms of the safe harbor,  the Company  notes that a variety of factors
could cause the Company's  actual  results and  experience to differ  materially
from the anticipated  results or other  expectations  expressed in the Company's
forward-looking  statements.  The risks and  uncertainties  that may  affect the
operations,  performance,  development,  growth  projections  and results of the
Company's  business include,  but are not limited to, the growth of the economy,
interest  rate  movements,  timely  development  by the  Company  of  technology
enhancements for its products and operating  systems,  the impact of competitive
products,  services and pricing,  customer business requirements,  Congressional
legislation  and similar  matters.  Readers of this report are  cautioned not to
place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking  statements  which  are  subject  to
influence  by the named risk factors and  unanticipated  future  events.  Actual
results, accordingly, may differ materially from management expectations.

Dear Stockholders:

I am pleased to report that the year 2000 was a solid year for your Company.  We
again enjoyed a successful  year, both in terms of the growth of the Bank and in
operating earnings. During 2000, we continued the tradition of record net income
from  operations and increased  quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. We
also  introduced our Internet  banking  solution,  First Federal Online Banking.
First Federal Savings Bank, the Company's subsidiary, set a new record for total
assets, ending the year with total assets in excess of $711 million. Our success
is truly a team effort,  and I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you
- - our stockholders, our customers, our communities, and our employees - for your
efforts and support as we moved through 2000 and into the year 2001.

During 2000,  the  Company's  net income from  operations  increased 9%, to $5.3
million from $4.8 million in 1999. As we previously reported to you, during 1999
the Company recorded a non-recurring  $553,000 after-tax gain ($886,000 pre-tax)
on the sale of  commercial  land owned by Lake  County  Service  Corporation,  a
subsidiary of the Bank.  With that  non-recurring  gain added to net income from
operations for 1999,  the Company's  total net income for 1999 was $5.4 million.
On a per share basis,  basic income  increased 9% to $1.50 for 2000  compared to
$1.37 (or $1.52 with the  non-recurring  gain) per share for 1999.  On a diluted
basis,  net income per share increased 11% to $1.46 for 2000,  compared to $1.32
(or $1.47 with the non-recurring gain) for 1999.

In January 2001, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the quarterly
cash dividend,  to $.13 per common share from the $.12 per common share paid for
the prior four quarters. That increase continues previous annual increases since
1994,  when the quarterly cash dividend was $.036 per common share (adjusted for
the five-for-three stock split in November 1997).

In July of 2000,  we introduced  our Internet  banking  solution,  First Federal
Online  Banking.  I am very pleased to report that First Federal  Online Banking
has received a warm reception from both our retail and commercial customers, and
enrollments have exceeded our expectations. If you haven't had a chance to check
out  First  Federal  Online  Banking,  I  encourage  you to visit  our  website,
1stfederal.com,  and  click  the  "Test  Drive"  button;  I  believe  you'll  be
pleasantly  surprised  at how  easily  and  completely  you  can  check  account
balances,  transfer funds, pay bills,  and access cash management  services (for
commercial  customers) on a 24-hour-a-day,  7-days-a-week basis. While you're at
our website,  I'd also  encourage you to note all the other useful  information,
including our loan and deposit products and pricing, links to our press releases
and financial reports,  local weather, and links to some other  "local-interest"
websites.

Asset  growth  continues to be an  important  focal point for the  Company.  The
Company's  total  assets grew 20%,  from $590.4  million at December 31, 1999 to
$711.5  million at December  31, 2000.  Although  the pace of loan  originations
declined  slightly during 2000 compared to 1999, the total loans receivable grew
21%,  from  $519.0  million to $630.4  million.  During  2000,  the Bank's  loan
originations  totaled  $220.1  million,  compared  to  $238.2  million  in 1999.
Originations  of residential  loans were $106.4 million,  commercial  loans were
$47.9  million,  and consumer  loans were $65.8  million for 2000.  Those volume
levels  compare  to  $133.3   million,   $59.2   million,   and  $45.7  million,
respectively, for 1999.

                                       4

The  Company's  growth was  funded by an $89.6  million  increase  in the Bank's
deposits,  a $24 million  increase in Federal  Home Loan Bank  advances,  and $7
million of cash provided from operations.  During 2000, the Bank's deposits grew
from $429.3 million to $518.9 million, an increase of 21%. Of the total increase
in deposits,  checking and other transaction accounts grew $9.5 million (or 9%),
while certificates of deposit grew $80.1 million (or 25%). During 2000, advances
from the Federal Home Loan Bank grew 24%, from $99 million to $123 million.  For
2000, cash provided from  operations was $7.4 million,  compared to $5.5 million
for 1999.

As we look forward to 2001, we are excited about finishing the remodeling of our
Main Office. We appreciate our customers' patience enduring  "construction dust"
and the use of a temporary banking facility, while we improved and renovated our
Main Office facilities. We hope you will stop by to see the improvements and let
us thank you personally at our Grand Re-Opening, which we expect to occur during
the second quarter of 2001.

I am also pleased to report that the FFLC Bancorp,  Inc.  Dividend  Reinvestment
Plan (the "Plan") established in January 2000, has been a success, with over 200
shareholders participating.  The Plan allows registered stockholders of at least
50 shares of common stock to reinvest  regular  dividends on all or a portion of
their common stock into additional shares. The Plan also allows  participants to
make optional cash purchases of common stock.  The  administrative  costs of the
Plan,  including  brokerage  commissions  for  reinvestment  and  optional  cash
purchases,  are paid by the Company. A booklet describing the Plan in detail was
mailed to  stockholders  in January of 2000. If you would like more  information
about the Plan, please contact us.

In spite of the success we enjoyed this year,  the  performance of the Company's
stock during the first part of 2000 was negatively  impacted by six  consecutive
interest rate increases by the Federal  Reserve,  as well as the continued rally
in  technology  stocks in the early months of 2000.  Like most bank stocks,  our
stock  suffered  during the first part of the year,  then began a recovery  that
continued  through the rest of 2000. Our stock price was $15.25 at the beginning
of 2000,  declined  to a low of  $11.25 in March  2000,  and then  increased  to
$14.8125 at December 31, 2000.  While we wish the market would  consistently and
fully credit us with the success we are  experiencing,  we remain convinced that
our best strategy for creating  long-term value to our  stockholders is to focus
on profitability and excellence in customer service.

We truly appreciate the loyalty and support of our stockholders,  our customers,
and our  employees.  We remain  committed  to doing what we can to increase  the
long-term value of our Company.  That commitment  includes meeting our customers
needs,  the  investment  needs  of  our  stockholders,  and  the  needs  of  the
communities  in which we have the  privilege to serve.  We believe FFLC Bancorp,
Inc.  is well  positioned  to meet  those  needs,  and we  look  forward  to the
opportunities before us.

Cordially yours,


/S/ Stephen T. Kurtz

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                            AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

First Federal Savings Bank of Lake County, the subsidiary of FFLC, was organized
in 1934 as a federally chartered savings and loan association and converted to a
federally  chartered stock savings bank on January 4, 1994. The Bank's principal
business  continues to be attracting retail deposits from the general public and
investing  those  deposits,  together  with  principal  repayments  on loans and
investments  and funds  generated from  operations,  primarily in mortgage loans
secured by one-to-four-family,  owner-occupied homes, commercial loans, consumer
securities  and, to a lesser  extent,  construction  loans and other loans,  and
multi-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, the Bank holds investments
permitted by federal laws and  regulations  including  securities  issued by the
U.S.   Government  and  agencies  thereof.   The  Bank's  revenues  are  derived
principally from interest on its loan and mortgage-backed  securities portfolios
and interest and dividends on its investment securities.

The Bank is a  community-oriented  savings  institution  offering  a variety  of
financial  services to meet the needs of the  communities it serves.  The Bank's
deposit  gathering  and  lending  markets  are  primarily  concentrated  in  the
communities  surrounding its full service  offices  located in Lake,  Sumter and
Citrus  counties in central  Florida.  Management  believes that its offices are
located in communities  that generally can be characterized as rural service and
retirement communities with residential neighborhoods comprised predominately of
one-to-four-family   residences.  The  Bank  is  the  largest  (by  asset  size)
locally-based  financial  institution in Lake County, and serves its market area
with a wide selection of residential  mortgage loans and other retail  financial
services.  Management considers the Bank's reputation for financial strength and
customer  service as a major advantage in attracting and retaining  customers in
its market area and believes it benefits from its community  orientation as well
as its established deposit base and level of core deposits.

The  Company's net income from  operations  increased 9% to $5.3 million for the
year ended  December 31, 2000 from $4.8 million for the 1999 period.  The Bank's
total assets  increased 20.5% to $711.5 million at December 31, 2000 from $590.4
million at December 31, 1999.  That  increase  resulted  primarily  from a 22.9%
increase in net loans  receivable  to $615.5  million at December  31, 2000 from
$500.9  million at December 31, 1999,  reflecting  increased  local loan demand.
Cash and cash equivalents  decreased 11.2% to $30.5 million at December 31, 2000
from $34.3  million at December 31,  1999.  Securities  increased  15.7% or $5.8
million during 2000.  Deposits increased 20.9% to $518.9 million at December 31,
2000 from $429.3  million at December 31, 1999.  Advances  from the Federal Home
Loan Bank  increased $24 million,  to $123 million at December 31, 2000 from $99
million at December 31, 1999.

REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

General

The operating  results of the Bank are affected by Federal laws and  regulations
and the Bank is subject to extensive regulation,  examination and supervision by
the Office of Thrift  Supervision  ("OTS"),  as its chartering  agency,  and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), as the deposit insurer. The Bank
is a member of the  Federal  Home  Loan Bank  ("FHLB")  System  and its  deposit
accounts  are  insured  up to  applicable  limits  by the  FDIC  under  the SAIF
("Savings  Association Insurance Fund"). The Bank must file reports with the OTS
and the FDIC  concerning its  activities and financial  condition in addition to
obtaining  regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such
as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial  institutions.  The OTS and
the FDIC  conduct  periodic  examinations  to test the  Bank's  compliance  with
various regulatory requirements.  The activities of the Company and the Bank are
governed by the Home Owner's Loan Act, as amended (the "HOLA"),  and, in certain
respects,  the Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Act (the  "FDIA").  A more  complete
description of the HOLA and FDIA is included in the Form 10-K.

Capital Requirements

The OTS capital regulations  require savings  institutions to meet three capital
standards: a 1.5% tangible capital standard; a 3% leverage (core capital) ratio;
and an 8% risk-based  capital  standard.  Under the OTS final rule  implementing
FDICIA,  generally, a well-capitalized  institution is defined as one that meets
the following capital standards:  a 5% tangible capital standard;  a 6% leverage
(core capital) ratio; and a 10% risk-based  capital  standard,  and has not been
notified by its Federal banking agency that it is in a "troubled  condition." At
December 31,  2000,  the Bank met each of its capital  requirements  and met the
criteria of a "well-capitalized" institution as defined above.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit
insurance  premiums  according to the level of risk involved in an institution's
activities. An institution's risk category is based upon whether the institution
is  classified as "well  capitalized,"  "adequately  capitalized"  or "less than
adequately  capitalized" and one of three supervisory  subcategories within each
capital group.  The supervisory  subgroup to which an institution is assigned is
based on a supervisory  evaluation and information  which the FDIC determines to
be relevant to the institution's  financial  condition and the risk posed to the
deposit  insurance fund.  Effective January 1, 1997, the FDIC lowered the annual
assessment  rates  for  SAIF  members  to 0 to 27  basis  points.  The  FDIC has
authority to raise  premiums if deemed  necessary.  If such action is taken,  it
could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the institution.

Under the FDIA,  insurance  of  deposits  may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon a
finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound  practices,  is in
an unsafe or unsound  condition  to  continue  operations  or has  violated  any
applicable law, regulation,  rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or the
OTS.  The  management  of the Bank does not know of any  practice,  condition or
violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

CREDIT RISK

The Bank's primary business is lending on residential  real estate,  an activity
with the inherent  risk of  generating  potential  loan losses the  magnitude of
which depend on a variety of factors  affecting  borrowers  which are beyond the
control of the Bank.  The Bank has  underwriting  guidelines  and credit  review
procedures designed to minimize such credit losses.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The  Company's  results of operations  are  dependent  primarily on net interest
income,   which  is  the   difference   between   the   income   earned  on  its
interest-earning  assets,  primarily its loans,  mortgage-backed  securities and
investment  securities,  and its  interest-bearing  liabilities,  consisting  of
deposits  and  borrowings.  The  operating  expenses of the Company  principally
consist of employee compensation,  occupancy expenses, federal deposit insurance
premiums and other general and administrative expenses. The Company's results of
operations are also  significantly  affected by general economic and competitive
conditions,  particularly changes in market interest rates,  government policies
and actions of regulatory authorities.

Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning
assets and expense on interest-bearing  liabilities. Net interest income depends
upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing  liabilities and
the interest rates earned or paid on them.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding
(i) the total dollar amount of interest and dividend  income of the Company from
interest-earning  assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar
amount of interest  expense on  interest-bearing  liabilities  and the resultant
average costs; (iii) net  interest/dividend  income; (iv) interest-rate  spread;
(v) net interest margin;  and (vi) weighted average yields and rates at December
31,  2000.  Yields and costs were  derived by dividing  income or expense by the
average balance of assets or liabilities,  respectively,  for the periods shown.
The average balance of loans receivable  includes loans on which the Company has
discontinued  accruing  interest.  The yields and costs  include  fees which are
considered to constitute adjustments to yields.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES

The Bank is required to maintain  minimum  levels of liquid assets as defined by
OTS regulations.  That  requirement,  which varies  periodically  depending upon
economic  conditions and deposit  flows,  is based upon a percentage of deposits
and  short-term  borrowings.   The  current  required  ratio  is  4%.  The  Bank
historically has maintained a level of liquid assets in excess of the regulatory
requirement.  Liquid assets  consist of cash,  cash  equivalents  and short- and
intermediate-term   U.S.  Government  and  government  agency  securities.   The
maintenance  of liquid assets allows for the  possibility  of  disintermediation
when interest rates fluctuate.  The Bank's liquidity ratios were 10.3% and 18.7%
at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively.

The Bank's  sources of funds include  proceeds from payments and  prepayments on
mortgage loans and mortgage-backed  securities,  proceeds from the maturities of
investment securities and deposits.  While maturities and scheduled amortization
of loans and investment  securities are  predictable  sources of funds,  deposit
inflows and mortgage  prepayments  are greatly  influenced by local  conditions,
general interest rates, and regulatory changes.

At December 31, 2000, the Bank had  outstanding  commitments to originate  $13.2
million of loans,  to fund unused lines of credit of $34.8 million,  to fund the
undisbursed  portion of loans in process of $12.1  million  and $1.5  million in
outstanding  standby  letters of  credit.  The Bank  believes  that it will have
sufficient  funds  available  to meet its  commitments.  At December  31,  2000,
certificates  of  deposit  which  were  scheduled  to mature in one year or less
totaled $316.3 million.  Management believes,  based on past experience,  that a
significant portion of these funds will remain with the Bank.

REGULATORY  CAPITAL  REQUIREMENTS

As a federally-chartered financial institution, the Bank is required to maintain
certain  minimum  amounts of  regulatory  capital.  Regulatory  capital is not a
valuation  allowance and has not been created by charges against  earnings.  The
following  table  provides a summary  of the  capital  requirements,  the Bank's
regulatory capital and the amounts in excess at December 31, 2000:

MARKET RISK

Market  risk is the risk of loss from  changes in market  prices and rates.  The
Company's market risk arises primarily from  interest-rate  risk inherent in its
lending and deposit taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors
and manages its  interest-rate  risk  exposure.  The  measurement of market risk
associated  with financial  instruments is meaningful  only when all related and
offsetting  on-  and  off-balance-sheet  transactions  are  aggregated,  and the
resulting  net  positions are  identified.  Disclosures  about the fair value of
financial instruments,  which reflect changes in market prices and rates, can be
found in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's  primary objective in managing  interest-rate  risk is to minimize
the  adverse  impact of changes  in  interest  rates on the Bank's net  interest
income and capital, while adjusting the Company's  asset-liability  structure to
obtain the maximum  yield-cost  spread on that  structure.  The  Company  relies
primarily  on its  asset-liability  management  to control  interest-rate  risk.
However,  a sudden and  substantial  increase  in interest  rates may  adversely
impact the Company's  earnings,  to the extent that the interest  rates borne by
assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed,  to the same extent,  or
on the same basis. The Company does not engage in trading activities.

ASSET /LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

The Bank's primary  mission is to provide home  ownership by offering  permanent
and  construction  residential  mortgage  loans and  consumer  financing  and by
providing  conveniently located depository facilities with transaction,  savings
and   certificate   accounts.   The  Bank's   goal  is  to   continue  to  be  a
well-capitalized   and  profitable  operation  that  provides  service  that  is
professional, efficient and courteous. The Bank seeks to fulfill its mission and
accomplish  its goals by pursuing  the  following  strategies:  (i)  emphasizing
lending in the one-to-four-family  residential mortgage market; (ii) controlling
interest-rate  risk;  (iii)  managing  deposit  pricing and asset  growth;  (iv)
emphasizing  cost  control;  and (v)  maintaining  asset quality by investing in
mortgage-backed  securities which, in management's  judgment,  provide a balance
between  yield  and  safety  in  a  home  mortgage  related  investment.  It  is
management's   intention  to  continue  to  employ  these  strategies  over  the
foreseeable future.

The Bank's profitability, like that of most financial institutions, is dependent
to a large extent upon its net interest income,  which is the difference between
its interest income on interest-earning  assets, such as loans,  mortgage-backed
securities   and   investment   securities,   and  its   interest   expense   on
interest-bearing liabilities,  such as deposits and other borrowings.  Financial
institutions  continue to be  affected by general  changes in levels of interest
rates and other economic factors beyond their control. At December 31, 2000, the
Bank's one-year interest  sensitivity gap (the difference  between the amount of
interest-earning  assets anticipated by the Bank to mature or reprice within one
year and the amount of interest-bearing  liabilities  anticipated by the Bank to
mature  or  reprice  within  one year) as a  percentage  of total  assets  was a
positive 8.92%.  Generally,  an institution with a positive gap would experience
an increase in net  interest  income in a period of rising  interest  rates or a
decrease  in net  interest  income  in a period  of  declining  interest  rates.
However, certain shortcomings are inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented
above.  For example,  although  certain assets and  liabilities may have similar
maturities  or  periods to  repricing,  they may react in  different  manners to
changes in market interest rates.  Therefore, no assurance can be given that the
Bank will be able to maintain its net  interest-rate  spread as market  interest
rates fluctuate.

The Bank monitors its interest-rate risk through the  Asset/Liability  Committee
which meets monthly and reports the results of such monitoring  quarterly to the
Board of Directors.  The Bank's policy is to seek to maintain a balance  between
interest-earning  assets  and  interest-bearing  liabilities  so that the Bank's
cumulative  one-year  gap ratio is within a range which  management  believes is
conducive to maintaining  profitability  without  incurring undue risk. The Bank
has  increased  its  investment  in  adjustable-rate  and shorter  average life,
fixed-rate  mortgage-related  securities in order to position itself against the
consequences of rising interest rates.  The Bank also maintains liquid assets in
excess  of  the  regulatory   requirement,   allowing  for  the  possibility  of
disintermediation  when interest rates fluctuate.  The Bank's liquidity ratio of
10.3%  at  December  31,  2000  is  significantly  higher  than  the  regulatory
requirement  of 4%. In  addition,  the Bank's  large  stable core  deposit  base
resulting  from its  continuing  commitment  to  quality  customer  service  has
historically provided it with a steady source of funds.

               COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 TO DECEMBER 31, 1999


               General Operating Results. Net income for the year ended December
                    31, 2000 was $5.3 million,  or $1.50 and $1.46 per basic and
                    diluted share,  respectively,  compared to $5.4 million,  or
                    $1.52 and $1.47 per basic and diluted  share,  respectively,
                    for the  comparable  period in 1999. Net income for the 1999
                    period  included  a gain on sale of  real  estate  held  for
                    development of $886,000 ($553,000,  net of tax). Without the
                    1999 gain on sale,  net income for 2000  exceeded net income
                    for the 1999  period by  $460,000  or 9.5%.  An  increase in
                    interest  income  of  $10.7  million,  partially  offset  by
                    increases   in   interest   expense  of  $8.9   million  and
                    noninterest  expense  of  $1.1  million  contributed  to the
                    increase in net income during the current year.

               Interest  Income.  Interest  income  increased  $10.7  million or
                    27.8%,  from $38.6  million for the year ended  December 31,
                    1999 to $49.4 million for the comparable period in 2000. The
                    increase  was due to a $119.2  million or 23.9%  increase in
                    average  interest-earning  assets  outstanding  for the year
                    ended  December 31, 2000  compared to the 1999 period and an
                    increase in the  average  yield  earned on  interest-earning
                    assets  from 7.73% for the year ended  December  31, 1999 to
                    7.98% for the year ended December 31, 2000.

               Interest  Expense.  Interest  expense  increased  $8.9 million or
                    41.7%,  from $21.2  million for the year ended  December 31,
                    1999 to $30.1 million for the year ended  December 31, 2000.
                    The  increase  was due to an increase  of $118.1  million in
                    average      interest-bearing      liabilities.      Average
                    interest-bearing  liabilities  increased from $451.4 million
                    outstanding  during  the year  ended  December  31,  1999 to
                    $569.5 million  outstanding during the comparable period for
                    2000. The average yield paid on interest-bearing liabilities
                    increased from 4.70% for the year ended December 31, 1999 to
                    5.28% for the comparable 2000 period.

               Noninterest  Income.   Noninterest  income  for  the  year  ended
                    December 31, 1999 exceeded  noninterest  income for the year
                    ended  December  31,  2000  primarily  as a  result  of  the
                    previously discussed pretax gain on sale of real estate held
                    for development  recognized during 1999, partially offset by
                    an increase of $201,000 in deposit  account  fees during the
                    2000 period.

               Noninterest  Expense.   Noninterest  expense  increased  by  $1.1
                    million  or 10.7%,  from  $10.3  million  for the year ended
                    December  31,  1999 to  $11.4  million  for the  year  ended
                    December  31,  2000.  The  increase  was  primarily  due  to
                    increases  in salaries  and  employee  benefits of $506,000,
                    occupancy expense of $370,000 and data processing expense of
                    $288,000,  all of which related to the overall growth of the
                    Company.

               Provision for Income  Taxes.  The provision for federal and state
                    income taxes  decreased from $3.3 million for the year ended
                    December 31, 1999 (an  effective  tax rate of 37.9%) to $3.4
                    million   (an   effective   tax  rate  of  38.8%)   for  the
                    corresponding period for 2000.

               COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 TO DECEMBER 31, 1998

               General Operating Results. Net income for the year ended December
                    31,  1999,  was $5.4  million or $1.52 per basic  income per
                    share,  compared  to net income for the year ended  December
                    31,  1998 of $4.4  million  or $1.22  per basic  income  per
                    share.  The increase in net income was  primarily the result
                    of an increase of $2.5 million in net interest income before
                    provision for loan losses for 1999,  partially  offset by an
                    increase of $1.9 million in noninterest expenses in 1999.

               Interest Income.  Interest  income  increased  $6.4  million,  or
                    20.0%,  from $32.2  million for the year ended  December 31,
                    1998 to $38.6 million for the year ended  December 31, 1999.
                    The increase  was due to an increase in the average  balance
                    of total  interest-earning  assets,  primarily  loans,  from
                    $404.1  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998 to
                    $499.6  million for the year ended  December  31,  1999,  an
                    increase of $95.5 million,  or 23.6%,  partially offset by a
                    decrease in the  average  yield on  interest-earning  assets
                    from 7.96% for the year ended December 31, 1998 to 7.73% for
                    the year ended December 31, 1999. The average yield on loans
                    decreased from 8.27% for the year ended December 31, 1998 to
                    7.99% for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The  average
                    yield on securities  decreased from 6.32% for the year ended
                    December  31, 1998 to 5.83% for the year ended  December 31,
                    1999.  The average yield on other  interest  earning  assets
                    decreased from 5.82% for the year ended December 31, 1998 to
                    5.59% for the year ended December 31, 1999.

               Interest Expense.  Interest  expense  increased $3.9 million from
                    $17.3  million  at  December  31,  1998 to $21.2  million at
                    December 31, 1999.  The increase was due to a $97.7  million
                    or  27.6%   increase  in  the   average   balance  of  total
                    interest-bearing  liabilities  from  $353.7  million for the
                    year ended  December 31, 1998 to $451.4 million for the year
                    ended  December 31, 1999 offset in part by a decrease in the
                    weighted-average  rate paid on interest-bearing  liabilities
                    from 4.88% during 1998 to 4.70% in 1999.

               Provision for Loan Losses.  The Bank's  provision for loan losses
                    increased from $682,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998
                    to  $719,000  for the year  ended  December  31,  1999.  The
                    increase of $37,000 reflects the Bank's continuing policy of
                    evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses and
                    prevailing standards within the thrift industry.  Generally,
                    such  evaluation  includes  consideration  of the  level  of
                    nonperforming  loans and the level  and  composition  of the
                    Bank's loan portfolio.

               Noninterest  Income.   Noninterest  income  increased  from  $1.3
                    million for the year ended December 31, 1998 to $2.3 million
                    for the year ended  December  31,  1999.  The  increase  was
                    primarily due to a $886,000 gain recognized in 1999 from the
                    sale of real  estate  held for  development  and a  $117,000
                    increase in other service charges and fees.

               Noninterest Expense.  Noninterest  expense consists  primarily of
                    salaries  and  employee  benefits  and  occupancy   expense.
                    Noninterest  expense  increased  $1.9  million  for the year
                    ended  December 31, 1999 compared to 1998.  The increase was
                    primarily  due  to  a  $998,000  increase  in  salaries  and
                    employee  benefits  and a  $459,000  increase  in  occupancy
                    expense,  all of  which  resulted  from  the  growth  of the
                    Company.

               Provision for Income  Taxes.  The provision for federal and state
                    income taxes  increased from $2.6 million for the year ended
                    December  31,  1998  to $3.3  million  for  the  year  ended
                    December 31, 1999.  The  effective tax rate  increased  from

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Consolidated  Financial  Statements and Notes thereto  presented herein have
been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP,  which  requires  the  measurement  of
financial  position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without
considering the changes in the relative  purchasing power of money over time due
to inflation.  The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the
Bank's operations.  Unlike most industrial companies,  nearly all the assets and
liabilities of the Bank are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have
a greater impact on the Bank's performance than do the effects of general levels
of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to
the same extent as the price of goods and services.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998


(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
       FFLC  Bancorp,  Inc. (the "Holding Company") was incorporated in Delaware
             on September 16, 1993, and acquired  First Federal  Savings Bank of
             Lake County (the "Bank") in connection  with the Bank's  conversion
             to stock form on January 4, 1994. The Holding  Company is a savings
             and loan holding  company  subject to  regulation  by the Office of
             Thrift Supervision ("OTS") which transacts its business through its
             subsidiary,  the  Bank.  The Bank is a  community-oriented  savings
             institution  which  offers  a  variety  of  financial  services  to
             individuals and businesses primarily located in Lake County, Sumter
             County and Citrus  County,  Florida.  The  deposits of the Bank are
             insured  by the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  ("FDIC")
             through the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF").

       Principles  of  Consolidation.   The  consolidated  financial  statements
             include  the  accounts of the Holding  Company,  the Bank,  and the
             Bank's  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Lake County Service  Corporation
             (the   "Service   Corporation").   All   significant   intercompany
             transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

       General. The accounting and reporting policies of FFLC Bancorp,  Inc. and
             its  subsidiaries  (together,  the "Company")  conform to generally
             accepted accounting  principles and to general practices within the
             thrift   industry.   The  following   summarizes  the   significant
             accounting policies of the Company:

       Use of Estimates.  In preparing   consolidated  financial  statements in
             conformity   with   generally   accepted   accounting   principles,
             management  is  required to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that
             affect the  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  as of the
             date of the balance  sheet and  reported  amounts of  revenues  and
             expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual results could differ
             from those  estimates.  Material  estimates  that are  particularly
             susceptible  to  significant  change in the near term relate to the
             determination  of the allowance for loan losses and foreclosed real
             estate.

       Cash  and Cash Equivalents.  For purposes of the consolidated  statements
             of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents  include cash and balances
             due from banks and interest-bearing deposits.

             The Bank is required to maintain  certain average reserve  balances
             pursuant  to  regulations  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Board.  These
             balances   must  be  maintained  in  the  form  of  vault  cash  or
             noninterest  bearing  deposits at a Federal  Reserve Bank. The Bank
             met this requirement at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

       Securities.  The Company may classify its  securities as either  trading,
             held to maturity or available for sale. Trading securities are held
             principally   for  resale  and   recorded  at  their  fair  values.
             Unrealized  gains and losses on  trading  securities  are  included
             immediately  in  earnings.  Held-to-maturity  securities  are those
             which the  Company has the  positive  intent and ability to hold to
             maturity  and are reported at  amortized  cost.  Available-for-sale
             securities   consist  of  securities   not  classified  as  trading
             securities nor as held-to-maturity  securities.  Unrealized holding
             gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale  securities are
             excluded  from income and reported in other  comprehensive  income.
             Gains and losses on the sale of  available-for-sale  securities are
             recorded   on   the   trade   date   and   determined   using   the
             specific-identification   method.   Premiums   and   discounts   on
             securities  available for sale are  recognized  in interest  income
             using the interest method over the period to maturity.

       Loans Receivable.  Loans  receivable  that  management has the intent and
             ability to hold for the  foreseeable  future or until  maturity  or
             pay-off are reported at their  outstanding  principal  adjusted for
             any  charge-offs,  the allowance for loan losses,  and any deferred
             fees or costs on originated loans.

             Loan  origination fees and  certain direct origination   costs  are
             capitalized  and  recognized  as an  adjustment of the yield of the
             related loan.

             The accrual of interest  on loans is  discontinued  at the time the
             loan is 90 days delinquent unless the credit is well-secured and in
             process of collection. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual
             or  charged-off  at an earlier date if  collection  of principal or
             interest is considered doubtful.

             All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on
             nonaccrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income.  The
             interest  on these  loans is  accounted  for on the  cash-basis  or
             cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans
             are returned to accrual  status when all the principal and interest
             amounts  contractually  due are brought current and future payments
             are reasonably assured.

       Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses is  established
             as losses are  estimated to have  occurred  through a provision for
             loan losses  charged to earnings.  Loan losses are charged  against
             the allowance when management  believes the  uncollectibility  of a
             loan  balance is  confirmed.  Subsequent  recoveries,  if any,  are
             credited to the allowance.

             The  allowance  for loan losses is evaluated on a regular  basis by
             management and is based upon  management's  periodic  review of the
             collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience,  the
             nature and volume of the loan  portfolio,  adverse  situations that
             may affect the borrower's ability to repay,  estimated value of any
             underlying  collateral and  prevailing  economic  conditions.  This
             evaluation is inherently  subjective as it requires  estimates that
             are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes
             available.

             A loan is considered  impaired when,  based on current  information
             and  events,  it is  probable  that the  Company  will be unable to
             collect the  scheduled  payments of principal or interest  when due
             according to the contractual  terms of the loan agreement.  Factors
             considered by management in determining  impairment include payment
             status,   collateral  value,  and  the  probability  of  collecting
             scheduled  principal  and interest  payments  when due.  Loans that
             experience  insignificant  payment  delays and  payment  shortfalls
             generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the
             significance  of  payment  delays  and  payment   shortfalls  on  a
             case-by-case   basis,   taking  into   consideration   all  of  the
             circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower,  including the
             length of the delay,  the  reasons  for the delay,  the  borrower's
             prior payment  record,  and the amount of the shortfall in relation
             to the  principal  and interest  owed.  Impairment is measured on a
             loan by loan basis for commercial loans by either the present value
             of expected  future cash flows  discounted at the loan's  effective
             interest  rate,  the loan's  obtainable  market price,  or the fair
             value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

             Large groups of smaller balance  homogeneous loans are collectively
             evaluated  for  impairment.   Accordingly,  the  Company  does  not
             separately  identify  individual consumer and residential loans for
             impairment disclosures.

       Foreclosed Real Estate.  Real estate properties  acquired through,  or in
             lieu of, loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded
             at fair value at the date of  foreclosure  establishing  a new cost
             basis. After foreclosure,  valuations are periodically performed by
             management  and the real estate is carried at the lower of carrying
             amount or fair value less cost to sell.  Revenue and expenses  from
             operations  and changes in the valuation  allowance are included in
             the consolidated statements of income.

       Premises and Equipment.  Land is carried at cost. The Company's premises,
             furniture and equipment and leasehold  improvements  are carried at
             cost,  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  amortization  computed
             principally using the straight-line method.

       Transfer of Financial Assets. Transfers of financial assets are accounted
             for as sales,  when control  over the assets has been  surrendered.
             Control over  transferred  assets is deemed to be surrendered  when
             (1) the  assets  have  been  isolated  from  the  Company,  (2) the
             transferee  obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it
             from taking  advantage  of that  right) to pledge or  exchange  the
             transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective
             control  over  the  transferred  assets  through  an  agreement  to
             repurchase them before their maturity.

       IncomeTaxes.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are determined  using
             the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net
             deferred  tax asset or  liability  is  determined  based on the tax
             effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases
             of the  various  balance  sheet  assets and  liabilities  and gives
             current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws.

       Stock Compensation  Plans.  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
             (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, encourages
             all entities to adopt a fair value based method of  accounting  for
             employee stock  compensation  plans,  whereby  compensation cost is
             measured  at the grant  date based on the value of the award and is
             recognized  over the service  period,  which is usually the vesting
             period.  However,  it also  allows an entity to continue to measure
             compensation  cost for those plans using the intrinsic  value based
             method of  accounting  prescribed by  Accounting  Principles  Board
             Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,  whereby
             compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price
             of the stock at the grant date (or other measurement date) over the
             amount an  employee  must pay to acquire the stock.  Stock  options
             issued  under the  Company's  stock  option plan have no  intrinsic
             value at the grant date,  and under Opinion No. 25 no  compensation
             cost is  recognized  for them.  The Company has elected to continue
             with the accounting methodology in Opinion No. 25 and, as a result,
             has  provided  proforma  disclosures  of net  income and income per
             share and other  disclosures,  as if the fair value based method of
             accounting had been applied. (See Note 16).

       Off-Balance Sheet  Instruments.  In the ordinary course of business,  the
             Company has entered into  off-balance-sheet  instruments consisting
             of  commitments   to  extend   credit,   unused  lines  of  credit,
             undisbursed  loans in process and standby  letters of credit.  Such
             financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when
             they are funded.

       Fair  Values of  Financial  Instruments.  The fair  value of a  financial
             instrument  is the current  amount that would be exchanged  between
             willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation.  Fair value is
             best determined based upon quoted market prices.  However,  in many
             instances,  there are no quoted  market  prices  for the  Company's
             various financial instruments.  In cases where quoted market prices
             are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present
             value  or  other  valuation   techniques.   Those   techniques  are
             significantly  affected  by the  assumptions  used,  including  the
             discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly,  the
             fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement
             of the instrument.  SFAS 107 excludes certain financial instruments
             and all nonfinancial  instruments from its disclosure requirements.
             Accordingly,  the aggregate  fair value  amounts  presented may not
             necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. The
             following  methods  and  assumptions  were used by the  Company  in
             estimating fair values of financial instruments:

             Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and short-
             term instruments approximate their fair value.

             Securities. Fair values for securities available for sale are based
             on quoted market prices,  where available.  If quoted market prices
             are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of
             comparable  instruments.  The  carrying  value of Federal Home Loan
             Bank stock approximates fair value.


                                       30

             Loans Receivable.  For variable-rate  loans that reprice frequently
             and have no  significant  change in credit  risk,  fair  values are
             based on  carrying  values.  Fair  values  for  certain  fixed-rate
             mortgage (e.g.  one-to-four  family  residential),  commercial real
             estate and commercial  loans are estimated  using  discounted  cash
             flow analyses,  using interest  rates  currently  being offered for
             loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.

             Deposit  Liabilities.  The fair values  disclosed for demand,  NOW,
             money market and savings deposits are, by definition,  equal to the
             amount  payable on demand at the  reporting  date  (that is,  their
             carrying  amounts).  Fair  values for  fixed-rate  certificates  of
             deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that
             applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a
             schedule  of  aggregated   expected  monthly   maturities  of  time
             deposits.

             Borrowed Funds. The carrying amounts of borrowings under repurchase
             agreements  approximate  their fair values.  Fair values of Federal
             Home Loan Bank advances are estimated  using  discounted  cash flow
             analysis based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates
             for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

             Accrued   Interest.   The  carrying  amounts  of  accrued  interest
             approximate their fair values.

             Off-Balance-Sheet  Instruments.  Fair values for  off-balance-sheet
             lending  commitments  are based on fees currently  charged to enter
             into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of
             the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing.

       Income Per Share of Common Stock.  The Company  follows the provisions of
             Financial  Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" (SFAS
             No. 128). SFAS No. 128 provides  accounting and reporting standards
             for calculating  income per share. Basic income per share of common
             stock has been  computed by dividing the net income for the year by
             the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Shares of common
             stock  purchased by the Employee Stock Option Plan ("ESOP") and the
             Retention and  Recognition  Plan ("RRP")  incentive plans (see Note
             16) are only considered outstanding when the shares are released or
             committed to be released for allocation to  participants.  The ESOP
             initially  purchased  368,242  shares,  of which 4,383  shares were
             released for  allocation to  participants  each month  beginning in
             January,  1994. As of December 31, 2000,  all ESOP shares have been
             allocated.  The RRP initially  purchased  184,122 shares,  of which
             179,541, 179,373 and 181,387 were allocated to participants and are
             considered  outstanding for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999
             and 2000,  respectively.  At December 31, 2000, 2,735 shares remain
             uncommitted  under the RRP plan and are not considered  outstanding
             for purposes of the  computation  of net income per share of common
             stock.  Diluted income per share is computed by dividing net income
             by the weighted average number of shares outstanding  including the
             dilutive  effect of stock options (see Note 16) computed  using the
             treasury  stock method  prescribed  by SFAS No. 128. The  following
             table  presents the  calculation  of net income per share of common
             stock:

       Securities with a carrying value of  approximately  $6.5 million and $4.0
             million at December 31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  were pledged
             to secure  public  funds and tax  deposits.  The  Company  has also
             pledged  securities  with a  carrying  value  of $9.9  million  for
             borrowings  under retail  repurchase  agreements  with customers at
             December 31, 2000 (See Note 6).

             There were no sales of securities during  the years ended  December
             31, 2000, 1999 or 1998.

       The   Company's   portfolio   of   mortgage-backed   securities   include
             collateralized  mortgage  obligations  (CMOs).  CMOs are  generally
             divided  into  tranches  whereby  principal   repayments  from  the
             underlying mortgages are used sequentially to retire the securities
             according to the priority of the tranches.  The Company  invests in
             the  following   collateralized   mortgage   obligation   tranches:
             sequential, planned amortization class, targeted amortization class
             or support or companion  floating-rate tranches. Such tranches have
             stated  maturities  ranging  from 1-22 years;  however,  because of
             prepayments, the expected weighted-average life of these securities
             at December 31, 2000 is  approximately  3.4 years.  The majority of
             the CMOs owned by the  Company are  insured or  guaranteed,  either
             directly  or   indirectly,   through   mortgage-backed   securities
             underlying  the  obligations  by either  the  FNMA,  FHLMC or GNMA.
             Depending  on  the  amount  of  the  Company's   available-for-sale
             mortgage-backed  securities,  fluctuations  in  the  interest  rate
             environment and other factors,  the Company may experience material
             effects  on  its  capital  resources  due  to  categorizing   these
             securities as available for sale. The Company's CMOs may be subject
             to price movements  which  typically  result from prepayment on the
             underlying obligations.  The Company's CMOs of $942,000 have coupon
             rates ranging from 7.25% to 7.56% and had a  weighted-average  rate
             of 7.36% at December  31,  2000.  The Company  purchases  only CMOs
             rated AA or better by nationally recognized rating services.

       The   Company  adopted FAS 133 effective July 1, 1999. As allowed by this
             standard,  the Company reclassified all securities held to maturity
             with a book value of $14,784,000  and a market value of $14,969,000
             to available for sale on July 1, 1999.

       The   Company originates or purchases nonresidential real property loans.
             These loans are considered by management to be of somewhat  greater
             risk of uncollectibility due to the dependency on income production
             or  future  development  of  the  real  estate.  Nearly  all of the
             Company's real property loans were  collateralized by real property
             in Lake, Sumter and Citrus Counties, Florida.

       Nonaccrual loans at December  31, 2000 and 1999  totaled  $2,510,000  and
             $2,362,000,  respectively.  For the year ended  December  31, 2000,
             interest  income on loans would have been  increased  approximately
             $230,000 if the interest on  nonaccrual  loans at December 31, 2000
             had been recorded under the original terms of such loans.

       Loans serviced for others,  consisting solely of participations sold, are
             not included in the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets. The
             unpaid  principal   balances  of  these  loans  were  approximately
             $940,000   and   $1,040,000   at   December   31,  2000  and  1999,
             respectively.

       The security  agreement  with  FHLB  includes  a blanket  floating  lien
             requiring  the Bank to  maintain  first  mortgage  loans as pledged
             collateral in an amount equal to at least,  when  discounted at 75%
             of the unpaid principal balances,  100% of these advances. The FHLB
             stock is also pledged as collateral for these advances. At December
             31, 2000, the Bank could borrow up to $192.2 million under the FHLB
             security agreement.

       The Bank has  an $8  million  line of  credit  facility  with one of its
             correspondent  banks, under which the Bank may draw funds for daily
             liquidity.  Borrowings  under  this line of  credit  must be repaid
             within  seven days.  The line of credit  bears a floating  interest
             rate equal to the  average  federal  funds rate and expires on June
             30, 2001. As of December 31, 2000,  the Bank has not used this line
             of credit.

       Other borrowed funds were composed of retail  repurchase  agreements with
             customers.  The Company  enters into retail  repurchase  agreements
             with  customers in which the funds  received are  accounted  for as
             borrowings to the Company. The total amount outstanding under these
             agreements at December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $6.4 million and $3.9
             million,  respectively.  The  Company  pledged  securities  with  a
             carrying  value of $9.9 million and $7.9 million as collateral  for
             these agreements at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

       Retained earnings at December  31, 2000 and 1999  includes  approximately
             $5,810,000  for which no deferred  federal income tax liability has
             been recognized.  This amount represents an allocation of income to
             bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.  Reduction of amounts so
             allocated   for  purposes   other  than  tax  bad  debt  losses  or
             adjustments  arising from  carryback of net operating  losses would
             create income for tax purposes only,  which would be subject to the
             then current  corporate  income tax rate. The  unrecorded  deferred
             income  tax  liability  on  the  above  amount  was   approximately
             $2,186,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999.

       The   Small  Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act") enacted
             on August 2, 1996 requires savings institutions,  such as the Bank,
             to  recapture  certain  portions  of  their  accumulated  bad  debt
             reserves, and eliminated the Percentage of Taxable Income Method of
             accounting for bad debts for tax purposes. The Bank was required to
             change  its  method of  accounting  for bad debts for tax  purposes
             effective  January 1, 1996.  In addition,  the Bank was required to
             recapture  the excess of its bad debt reserves at December 31, 1995
             over its base year  reserves at December 31,  1987,  ratably over a
             six-year  period  beginning in 1998. At December 31, 2000, the Bank
             had approximately $454,000 of deferred tax liabilities recorded for
             the recapture of its excess bad debt reserves.

(8)  Pension Plan
       The Company has a defined  contribution  profit sharing  401(k) plan (the
             "401(k)  Plan").  All  employees  who  have met a  minimum  service
             requirement  (1,000 hours of service in a twelve-month  period) may
             participate in the Plan.  Under the 401(k) Plan, a participant  may
             elect to contribute up to 15% of their annual compensation, subject
             to IRS limitations on total annual contributions.  The Company will
             make  contributions  to the 401(k)  Plan on a monthly  basis at two
             percent of participants' compensation.  Contributions to the 401(k)
             Plan for the years  ended  December  31,  2000,  1999 and 1998 were
             $65,700, $54,000 and $46,000, respectively.

       Effective January 1, 2001,  the Board of Directors  approved the transfer
             from the  multi-employer  401(k) plan the Company has  participated
             in,  to  a  single  employer  401(k)  plan,  and  the  simultaneous
             combination  of that plan with the Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan
             discussed in Note 16. Under the modified 401(k) plan, participation
             will be open to all  employees  the  month  after  hire  date  (for
             purposes of  employer  contributions,  one year of service  will be
             required), and participants will have the twelve investment options
             offered  by the  previous  plan,  plus a Company  stock  fund.  The
             Company will make a  contribution  of 3% of  compensation  (for all
             participants  who have met the  one-year  of service  requirement),
             which will vest immediately.  In addition,  the Company will make a
             discretionary  matching contribution (for all participants who have
             met the  one-year  of service  requirement),  which will vest after
             five years of service.  For 2001, the Board has approved a matching
             contribution  equal to 100% of  employees'  deferrals,  up to 3% of
             compensation.  The amounts of employee and  employer  contributions
             under the 401(k) and the ESOP are subject to IRS limitations.

(9)  Financial Instruments
       The   Company is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet
             risk in the normal course of business to meet the  financing  needs
             of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to  fluctuations in
             interest  rates.  These  financial  instruments  are commitments to
             extend credit, unused lines of credit, undisbursed loans in process
             and standby letters of credit and may involve,  to varying degrees,
             elements of credit and  interest-rate  risk in excess of the amount
             recognized in the consolidated  balance sheet. The contract amounts
             of these instruments  reflect the extent of involvement the Company
             has in these financial instruments.

       The   Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
             the other party to the  financial  instrument  for  commitments  to
             extend credit is  represented  by the  contractual  amount of those
             instruments.  The Company  uses the same credit  policies in making
             commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.



                                       39

       Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
             as  there  is no  violation  of any  condition  established  in the
             contract.  Commitments  generally  have fixed  expiration  dates or
             other  termination  clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since
             some of the  commitments are expected to expire without being drawn
             upon, the total  commitment  amounts do not  necessarily  represent
             future cash  requirements.  The Company  evaluates each  customer's
             credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral
             obtained if deemed  necessary  by the  Company  upon  extension  of
             credit  is  based  on   management's   credit   evaluation  of  the
             counterparty.

       Standby  letters  of credit  are  conditional  commitments  issued by the
             Company to  guarantee  the  performance  of a  customer  to a third
             party.  The credit risk  involved  in issuing  letters of credit is
             essentially  the  same as  that  involved  in  extending  loans  to
             customers.

(10)  Significant Group Concentration of Credit Risk
       The  Company  grants  real  estate,  commercial  and   consumer  loans to
             customers  primarily  in the State of Florida  with the majority of
             such loans in the Lake,  Sumter and Citrus County area.  Therefore,
             the Company's exposure to credit risk is significantly  affected by
             changes in the economy of the Lake,  Sumter and Citrus County area.
             In  addition,  the Company  has a  concentration  of  single-family
             residential  mortgage  loans in a specific  residential  retirement
             community of approximately $123.8 million at December 31, 2000.

       The contractual  amounts of credit  related financial instruments such as
             commitments  to extend  credit  represent  the amounts of potential
             accounting  loss  should the  contract  be fully  drawn  upon,  the
             customer  default and the value of any existing  collateral  become

                                                           =====        =====

(12)  Commitments and Contingencies
       In the  ordinary   course  of   business,   the   Company   has   various
             outstanding  commitments  and contingent  liabilities  that are not
             reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In
             addition,  the Company is a defendant  in certain  claims and legal
             actions arising in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion
             of management,  after consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate
             disposition  of these  matters is not  expected  to have a material
             adverse  effect  on the  consolidated  financial  condition  of the
             Company.

(13)  Restrictions on Retained Earnings
       The Bank is subject  to  certain  restrictions on the amount of dividends
             that it may declare without prior regulatory approval.  At December
             31, 2000,  approximately  $19.5  million of retained  earnings were
             available  for  dividend   declaration   without  prior  regulatory
             approval.

(14)  Regulatory Matters
       The Bank  is  subject  to  various   regulatory    capital   requirements
             administered  by the  federal  banking  agencies.  Failure  to meet
             minimum capital  requirements  can initiate  certain  mandatory and
             possibly  additional  discretionary  actions by regulators that, if
             undertaken,  could have a direct  material  effect on the Company's
             financial  statements.  Under capital  adequacy  guidelines and the
             regulatory  framework for prompt corrective  action,  the Bank must
             meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures
             of the Bank's assets,  liabilities,  and certain  off-balance-sheet
             items as calculated  under  regulatory  accounting  practices.  The
             Bank's  capital  amounts  and  classification  are also  subject to
             qualitative  judgements by the regulators  about  components,  risk
             weightings, and other factors.

       Quantitative  measures   established  by  regulation  to  ensure  capital
             adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts (set forth in
             the table  below) of total and Tier I capital  (as  defined  in the
             regulations)  to  risk-weighted  assets  (as  defined).  Management
             believes,  as of December 31, 2000, that the Bank meets all capital
             adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

       As of December 31,  2000,  the  most  recent  notification  from  the OTS
             categorized  the  Bank as well  capitalized  under  the  regulatory
             framework for prompt  corrective  action. To be categorized as well
             capitalized,  the  Bank  must  maintain  minimum  tangible,  tier I
             (core),  tier I (risk-based) and total risk-based capital ratios as
             set forth in the table.  There are no  conditions  or events  since
             that  notification  that  management   believes  have  changed  the
             institution's category.

(15)  Conversion to Stock Savings Bank
       The Bank successfully completed a conversion  from a  federally chartered
             mutual savings  association to a federally  chartered stock savings
             bank on January 4, 1994  pursuant  to the Plan of  Conversion.  The
             Plan of Conversion  provided for the establishment of a Liquidation
             Account  equal to the  retained  income of the Bank as of September
             30, 1993 (the date of the most recent financial statement presented
             in the final  conversion  prospectus).  The Liquidation  Account is
             established  to provide a limited  priority  claim to the assets of
             the  Bank  to  qualifying  depositors  as  of  September  30,  1992
             (Eligible Account Holders) who continue to maintain deposits in the
             Bank  after  conversion.  In  the  unlikely  event  of  a  complete
             liquidation  of the Bank,  and only in such  event,  each  Eligible
             Account  Holder  would  receive  from  the  Liquidation  Account  a
             liquidation  distribution based on their proportionate share of the
             then total remaining qualifying deposits.

      Current regulations  allow the Bank to pay  dividends  on its  stock after
               the  conversion  if its  regulatory  capital would not thereby be
               reduced  below the amount then  required  for the  aforementioned
               Liquidation Account. Also, capital distribution regulations limit
               the Bank's  ability to make capital  distributions  which include
               dividends,  stock redemptions and repurchases,  cash-out mergers,
               interest   payments  on  certain   convertible   debt  and  other
               transactions  charged  to the  capital  account  based  on  their
               capital level and supervisory condition.

(16)  Stock Benefit Plans

       The Company follows the provisions of  Statement of Financial Accounting
             Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS
             No. 123"). SFAS No. 123 applies to stock-based  compensation  under
             the Company's  incentive  stock option plan (the "Option Plan") and
             under the Company's Recognition and Retention Plan discussed below.
             As allowed by SFAS No.  123,  the  Company  elected to  continue to
             measure  compensation  cost for the options or shares granted under
             either  plan  using  the  intrinsic   value  method  of  accounting
             prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to
             Employees."  SFAS  No.  123 does not  apply to the  Employee  Stock
             Ownership Plan discussed below.

       During the years ended  December 31, 2000,  1999 and 1998, 5,035,  16,250
             and 18,000 options were granted under the Option Plan. SFAS No. 123
             requires pro forma fair value  disclosures  if the intrinsic  value
             method is being  utilized.  In order to calculate the fair value of
             the options,  it was assumed that the  risk-free  interest rate was
             7.0% for each period, an annualized dividend yield of approximately
             2.0% would apply over the exercise period, the expected life of the
             options would be the entire  exercise period and the expected stock
             volatility was 37%, 36% and 42%,  respectively,  for 2000, 1999 and
             1998.  For purposes of pro forma  disclosures,  the estimated  fair
             value was  included in expense in the period  vesting  occurs.  The
             proforma  information  has been  determined  as if the  Company had
             accounted  for its stock  options and share  awards  under the fair
             value  method  of SFAS No.  123 and is as  follows  (in  thousands,
             except per share amounts):

       Stock Option  Plan.  The  Company  has a Stock  Option  Plan under  which
             460,303  common  shares are  authorized to be granted to directors,
             officers and employees of the Bank. Shares granted under the Option
             Plan are exercisable at the market price at the date of grant. Such
             incentive  stock  options  granted to officers  and  employees  are
             exercisable  in three  equal  annual  installments,  with the first
             installment  becoming  exercisable one year from the date of grant.
             Options granted to outside  directors are exercisable  immediately,
             but any common shares obtained from exercise of the options may not
             be sold  prior to one year  from the  date of  grant.  All  options
             expire at the earlier of ten years for  officers  and  employees or
             twenty  years  for  directors  from  the  date of grant or one year
             following the date which the outside director,  officer or employee
             ceases to serve in such  capacity.  At December  31,  2000,  33,714
             shares remain available for grant to future directors, officers and
             employees.

             of options issued to directors to twenty years from ten years.

       Employee Stock  Ownership  Plan.  Through  December 31, 2000, the Company
             sponsored a leveraged  ESOP that  covered  eligible  employees  who
             completed a year of service. The Bank made quarterly  contributions
             to the ESOP  equal  to the  ESOP's  debt  service.  The ESOP  Trust
             purchased  368,242 shares of common stock in the Company's  initial
             public  offering  with the  proceeds  from a loan from the Company.
             That  loan  bore  interest  at a  fixed-rate  of six  percent  with
             principal and interest payable in equal quarterly installments over
             seven years and the loan was  paid-off in December  2000.  The ESOP
             shares  initially  were pledged as collateral  for its debt. As the
             debt was repaid, shares were released from collateral and allocated
             to active  employees  based on the  proportion of debt service paid
             during the year.  The Company  accounted for its ESOP in accordance
             with Statement of Position 93-6. Accordingly,  the debt of the ESOP
             was  recorded  as  debt  and  the  cost of the  shares  pledged  as
             collateral were reported as a contra equity account. As shares were
             released  from  collateral,   the  Company  recorded   compensation
             expense, and an offsetting credit to capital,  equal to the current
             market price of the shares,  and the shares became  outstanding for
             income per share  computations.  Dividends  on all ESOP shares were
             recorded as compensation  expense as it was management's  intention
             to allocate  the  dividends  along with the shares when  allocated.
             Compensation  expense for the years ended  December 31, 2000,  1999
             and 1998 included the following ESOP related costs:

             combining of the ESOP with the Company's 401(k) Plan. (See Note 8).
             In   connection   therewith,   the  Company  will  make   quarterly
             profit-sharing  contributions in amounts approved by the Board, and
             those   contributions   will  be   allocated  to  the  accounts  of
             participating employees on a quarterly basis. Company contributions
             under the ESOP will vest after five years of service. For 2001, the
             Board  has  approved  profit-sharing  contributions  equal  to four
             percent (4%) of the Bank's operating net income, which will be made
             each quarter based on the actual results of the preceding  quarter.
             The Plan  allows  the  Company to fund such ESOP  contributions  by
             either issuing shares,  or purchasing the required number of shares
             on the open market.  As these  shares are  allocated on a quarterly
             basis, the Company will record compensation  expense, and either an
             offsetting  credit to capital (in the event that shares are issued)
             or to cash (in the event  that  shares  are  purchased  on the open
             market),  equal to the  current  market  price of the  shares.  The
             shares become  outstanding for income per share  computations  when
             allocated.

       Recognition and Retention Plan. The Company adopted, and the shareholders
             approved,  an RRP for  directors,  officers and employees to enable
             the Bank to attract and retain  experienced and capable  personnel.
             On January 4, 1994, the conversion  date,  184,122 shares of common
             stock  were  purchased  for the RRP  which  included  8,067  shares
             reserved for future directors,  officers and employees.  The shares
             are granted in the form of  restricted  stock to be earned in three
             equal annual  installments  beginning April 4, 1995. The RRP shares
             purchased  in  the   conversion   initially   were   excluded  from
             stockholders'  equity. The Company recognized  compensation expense
             in the amount of the fair market  value of the common  stock at the
             grant date of $6 per share, pro rata over the years (1996, 1995 and
             1994)  during which the shares were earned and payable and recorded
             a credit to  shareholders'  equity.  The shares are entitled to all
             voting and other shareholder rights,  except that the shares, while
             restricted,  cannot be sold,  pledged or otherwise disposed of, and
             are required to be held in escrow.

       If    a holder of restricted  stock under the RRP  terminated  employment
             for reasons other than death,  disability,  retirement or change of
             control in the Company,  such  employee  forfeits all rights to any
             allocated  shares which are still  restricted.  If  termination  is
             caused by death, disability, retirement or change in control of the
             Company, all allocated shares become unrestricted.  Forfeitures are
             reallocated  to eligible  participants  annually.  At December  31,
             2000, 2,735 shares remain reserved for future  directors,  officers
             and employees.

             stock  repurchase  programs  which  allowed  the Company to acquire
             common stock in the open market.  The Company received OTS approval
             for the programs and began repurchasing  shares within one month of
             approval.  During the year ended  December  31,  1996,  all 132,000
             shares  approved  under the January 1996 program were  repurchased.

             shares approved under the August 1996 program were repurchased.

       In January 1997, the  Company's  Board  of Directors  approved  a program
             which allowed the Company to acquire additional common stock in the
             open  market.  During the year ended  December  31,  1997,  178,690
             shares or 60.6% of the 294,928  shares  approved under that program
             were repurchased.

       In September 1998, the  Company's Board of  Directors  approved a program
             which allowed the Company to acquire 369,285  additional  shares of
             common stock in the open market. During the year ended December 31,
             1998, the remaining  shares approved under the January 1997 program
             were  repurchased.  During the year ended  December 31, 1998 32,025

       On January 7, 2000,  the  Company  established  a  Dividend  Reinvestment
              Plan (the  "DRP").  The DRP was approved by the Board of Directors
              on December  30, 1999 and is intended to provide  stockholders  of
              record of at least 50 shares with a convenient  and economical way
              to automatically reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends
              and to invest  optional  cash  payments,  subject to  minimum  and
              maximum  purchase  limitations,  in  additional  shares  of common

                          Independent Auditors' Report



The Board of Directors
FFLC Bancorp, Inc.
Leesburg, Florida:

               We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of
FFLC  Bancorp,  Inc. (the parent  company of First Federal  Savings Bank of Lake
County) and Subsidiary (together the "Company") as of December 31, 2000 and 1999
and the related  consolidated  statements  of income,  changes in  stockholders'
equity  and cash  flows for each of the  years in the  three-year  period  ended
December 31, 2000.  These  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of the
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

               We conducted our audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
auditing  standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

               In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of the
Company as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the results of its  operations  and
its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2000 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
