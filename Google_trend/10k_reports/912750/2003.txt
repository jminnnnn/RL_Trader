                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

     We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration,
development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties. Our company
was founded in 1989 and we acquired our first property in 1990. Our initial
focus area was the Gulf of Mexico. In the mid-1990s, we began to expand our
operations to other select areas. Our primary areas of operation now include the
U.S. onshore Gulf Coast, West Texas, the Anadarko Basin and offshore northwest
Australia. Over the last two years, we have acquired significant onshore assets.
Today, more than half of our reserves are located onshore in the U.S.

     General information about us can be found at www.newfld.com. Our Annual
Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form
8-K, as well as any amendments and exhibits to those reports, are available free
of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or
furnish them to the SEC.

     At year-end 2002, we had proved reserves of 1.2 Tcfe. Of those reserves:

     - 81% were natural gas;

     - 93% were proved developed;

     - 44% were located in the Gulf of Mexico;

     - 54% were located onshore in the U.S.; and

     - 2% were located offshore Australia.

STRATEGY

     The elements of our growth strategy have remained substantially unchanged
since our founding and consist of:

     - balancing our efforts among exploration, the acquisition of proved
       reserves and the development of proved properties;

     - growing reserves through the drilling of a balanced risk/reward
       portfolio;

     - focusing on select geographic areas;

     - controlling operations and costs;

     - using 3-D seismic data and other advanced technologies; and

     - attracting and retaining a quality workforce through equity ownership and
       other performance-based incentives.

     BALANCE.  We actively pursue the acquisition of proved oil and gas
properties in our existing focus areas and other select geographic areas. The
potential to add reserves through the drillbit is a critical consideration in
our acquisition screening process. Each year we invest a significant portion of
our capital budget in exploration. We also actively look for new drilling ideas
on our existing property base and on properties that may be acquired at federal
lease sales or by farm-in. Our recent large acquisitions and drilling success
provide us with significant development potential.
<PAGE>

     DRILLING PROGRAM.  The reserves targeted by our drilling program are
distributed throughout the risk/reward spectrum. In an effort to manage the
risks associated with our strategy to grow our reserves through the drillbit,
each year we drill a greater number of lower risk, low to moderate potential
prospects and a lesser number of higher risk, higher potential prospects. We
have recently complemented our traditional drilling activities on the Gulf of
Mexico shelf with two higher potential plays in the Gulf of Mexico -- the deep
shelf and deepwater.

     GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS.  We believe that our long-term success requires extensive
knowledge of the geologic and operating conditions in the areas where we
operate. Because of this belief, we focus our efforts on a limited number of
geographic areas where we can use our core competencies and have a significant
influence on operations. We also believe that geographic focus allows us to make
the most efficient use of our capital and personnel.

     CONTROL OF OPERATIONS AND COSTS.  In general, we prefer to operate our
properties. By controlling operations, we can better manage production
performance, control operating expenses and capital expenditures, consider the
application of technologies and influence timing. At the end of 2002, we
operated about 80% of our total production. In an effort to control costs, we
also use independent contractors for much of our domestic offshore operating
activities.

     TECHNOLOGY.  We use advanced technologies in our exploration and
development activities to help reduce risks and lower costs. At February 28,
2003, we held licenses or otherwise had access to 3-D seismic surveys covering
approximately 3,500 blocks (about 17 million acres) in the Gulf of Mexico's
shallow waters, access to about 1,000 blocks in the deepwater of the Gulf of
Mexico, more than 2,500 square miles in southern Louisiana and South Texas,
2,400 square miles in the Anadarko Basin, 350 square kilometers covering the
area where we are active offshore China and 17,280 square kilometers in the
North Sea. We are planning to shoot 200 square kilometers of seismic on our
license area offshore Brazil in late 2003.

     EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  We want our employees to act
like owners. To achieve this, we reward and encourage them through equity
ownership and incentive compensation based on performance and profitability. A
significant portion of our employees' compensation is discretionary and
performance-based. As of February 28, 2003, our employees owned or had options
to acquire no less than 10% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted
basis.

EEX ACQUISITION

     Our most significant event in 2002 was the acquisition of EEX Corporation,
which closed in late November 2002. At closing, we booked 288 Bcfe of proved
reserves as a result of the acquisition. These reserves are concentrated in
South Texas. The EEX properties are very complementary to our previously
existing South Texas property base. The acquisition tripled our acreage position
in South Texas and we now rank as one of the largest producers in the area. We
also acquired interests in approximately 60,000 gross mineral acres in southern
Louisiana, about 60 lease blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and 26 lease
blocks in shallow water associated with an "ultra-deep" (greater than 20,000
feet) exploration concept known as "Treasure Island."

FOCUS AREAS

     GULF OF MEXICO.  We have extensive experience in the Gulf of Mexico and it
is where we continue to invest the largest portion of our capital program. The
Gulf of Mexico is a prolific oil and gas province, accounting for approximately
25% of domestic natural gas production. It has substantial existing
infrastructure, including gathering systems, platforms and pipelines,
facilitating cost effective operations and timely development of discoveries. We
believe that the Gulf of Mexico has significant remaining undiscovered reserve
potential.

     We expect to remain one of the most active drillers in the traditional
shallow water plays of the Gulf of Mexico. Our activities here will be
complemented by higher risk, higher potential plays in two areas -- the

                                        2
<PAGE>

deep shelf and deepwater. We also are evaluating the Treasure Island concept.
The ultra-deep targets of this concept are high risk but the potential reserve
impact could be significant.

     Traditional Shelf.  We consider the traditional shelf generally to be
horizons at depths of less than 13,000-15,000 feet located in water depths of
generally less than 1,000 feet. We operate about 150 production platforms and
utilize this infrastructure to our advantage. Although prospects in the
traditional shelf usually offer modest reserve potential, the risks associated
with these prospects generally are lower.

     Deep Shelf.  We are exploring deeper horizons on the shelf with recent
wells drilled to depths of 15,000-20,000 feet. We have drilled five successful
deep shelf wells out of eight attempts to date. Our early success in this play
is encouraging; however the risk profile of these wells is significantly
different than our traditional shelf drilling. Deeper targets are more difficult
to detect with traditional seismic processing. Drilling expense and the risk of
mechanical failure for these wells are likely to be significantly higher because
of the additional drilling depth and conditions such as high temperature and
pressure.

     Deepwater.  We established a deepwater team in 2001. The risks associated
with deepwater operations can be significantly greater than traditional shelf
operations. Drilling and development costs may be materially higher and lead
times to first production may be much longer. We are focusing on projects near
infrastructure and in water depths where development technology is proven. As
our knowledge and experience base advances, we will consider moving into deeper
waters, toward larger targets and into more remote regions where infrastructure
may not exist. Following our acquisition of EEX, we now own an interest in more
than 60 deepwater lease blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. We also have made some
personnel additions to give us additional expertise in this new effort.

     ONSHORE GULF COAST.  We established onshore Gulf Coast operations in 1995.
The onshore Gulf Coast is a major focus area for us today, representing about
one-third of our total proved reserves and daily production. Our operations are
concentrated in South Texas, South Louisiana and the Val Verde Basin in West
Texas. Because much of the onshore Gulf Coast has geologic features similar to
the Gulf of Mexico, our onshore program benefits from our significant expertise
and knowledge base in the Gulf. Over the last two years, we have made
significant investments in seismic data. We continue to screen for attractive
acquisitions to further expand this focus area.

     MID-CONTINENT.  Through an acquisition in January 2001, we added the
Mid-Continent as a focus area. About 90% of our proved reserves in the
Mid-Continent are located in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. These assets are
typically longer-lived and offset our shorter reserve life properties in the
Gulf Coast region. We believe that the Anadarko Basin provides an opportunity
for future growth. It is a gas-rich province characterized by multiple
productive zones and relatively low drilling costs. Like the Gulf of Mexico, it
is a mature basin, offering the potential to consolidate properties. We manage
our Mid-Continent assets from our Tulsa, Oklahoma office.

     INTERNATIONAL.  In the mid-1990s, we began to consider investment in select
international areas to provide additional or alternative opportunities and to
gain exposure to high potential prospects. We currently own an interest in two
undeveloped fields offshore China and two producing oil fields offshore
Australia. Our Australian operations are managed by our Perth, Australia office.
In 2002, we opened an office in London, England, to pursue opportunities in the
North Sea and were the successful bidder on a lease block offshore Brazil. We
continue to evaluate and pursue opportunities for expansion in select
international areas, particularly in the North Sea.

PLANS FOR 2003

     Our capital budget for 2003 is $450 million, excluding acquisitions. We
expect that 55-60% of the budget will be invested in the Gulf of Mexico
(including deepwater), 35-40% in the onshore U.S. and the balance in
international projects. We plan to drill 100-150 wells in 2003, about half of
which will be exploratory.

     GULF OF MEXICO.  We plan to remain one of the most active drillers in the
traditional shallow water plays of the Gulf of Mexico. More than half of our
2003 capital budget is allocated to the Gulf of Mexico, where we

                                        3
<PAGE>

expect to drill 25-35 wells. In addition to 18-25 wells in the traditional
shelf, we expect to drill eight to ten wells in the deep shelf and two or three
in deepwater.

     ONSHORE GULF COAST.  In 2003, we will balance development drilling of lower
risk opportunities with some higher risk, higher impact exploration tests. We
plan to drill 40-50 wells.

     MID-CONTINENT.  Our Mid-Continent drilling program is predominantly
comprised of lower risk development wells. In 2003, we expect to drill
approximately 40-60 wells.

     INTERNATIONAL.  We anticipate that the operator will elect in 2003 to drill
one additional appraisal well in each of the CFD 12-1 and CFD 12-1 South Fields
in Bohai Bay, offshore China. During 2003, we will continue to evaluate
development potential for these fields and for the Montara discovery offshore
Australia.

MARKETING

     We market nearly all of our oil and gas production from the properties we
operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest
owners in these properties. Substantially all of our natural gas production is
sold to a variety of purchasers under short-term (less than 12 months) contracts
at current market prices. Oil sales contracts are short-term and are based upon
posted prices plus negotiated bonuses. For a list of purchasers of our oil and
gas production that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue for the
three preceding calendar years, please see Note 1, "Organization and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies -- Major Customers," to our consolidated
financial statements. Because alternative purchasers of oil and gas are readily
available, we believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a
material adverse effect on us.

COMPETITION

     Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense, particularly with
respect to the acquisition of producing properties and proved undeveloped
acreage. For a further discussion of this competitive environment, please see

EMPLOYEES

     At February 28, 2003, we had 488 employees. We believe that our
relationships with our employees are satisfactory.

     None of our 368 U.S. and U.K. employees is covered by a collective
bargaining agreement. We regularly utilize independent consultants and
contractors to perform various professional services, particularly in the areas
of acquisition evaluation, construction, design, well site surveillance,
permitting and environmental assessment. U.S. offshore field and on-site
production operation services, such as pumping, maintenance, dispatching,
inspection and testing, are generally provided by independent contractors.

     We have 120 employees located in Australia. Our Perth, Australia office
employs 25 people to manage our offshore operations. The remaining employees
work offshore on our FPSOs. These offshore employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements. At February 28, 2003, there were no significant issues
outstanding under our collective bargaining agreements.

REGULATION AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

CONCENTRATION

     We have diversified our asset base over the last several years. About 44%
of our proved reserves are now located in the Gulf of Mexico compared to about
90% just five years ago. In total, 75% of our proved reserves are located in the
Gulf of Mexico and coastal regions. While our ten largest properties accounted
for approximately 32% of our equivalent proved reserves at year-end 2002, no
single property held more than 5% of our proved reserves or more than 4% of the
net present value of our proved reserves.

GULF OF MEXICO

     Our properties are in water depths ranging from 45 to more than 6,000 feet.
As of December 31, 2002, we owned interests in more than 200 leases
(approximately 1.2 million gross acres) and about 310 gross wells. We operated
87% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2002.

U.S. ONSHORE GULF COAST

     We have a significant acreage position along the Texas and Louisiana
Coasts. As of December 31, 2002, we owned an interest in nearly 375,000 gross
acres and about 435 gross wells. We operated 70% of our proved reserves at
December 31, 2002.

MID-CONTINENT

     We have a sizeable presence in the Anadarko Basin, established with an
acquisition in early 2001. As of December 31, 2002, we owned an interest in
approximately 475,000 gross lease acres, 22,000 gross mineral acres and 1,500
gross wells. We operated about 75% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2002.

INTERNATIONAL

     AUSTRALIA.  In 1999, we acquired a 50% interest in two producing oil fields
(Jabiru and Challis) and two related FPSOs in the Timor Sea, offshore northwest
Australia. Although these fields are on natural decline, they have benefited
from our gas lift optimization program and have performed above our original
expectations. In late 2001, we acquired by farm-in a 50% interest in a license
area about 55 miles southwest of our producing fields. An existing discovery,
known as "Montara," is located on the license area. We drilled an appraisal well
on this discovery in mid-2002 that tested at a rate of 5,000 Bbls of oil per
day. We are evaluating development options for Montara and have not yet booked
any proved reserves to this field. In mid-2003, we expect to relinquish our
remaining exploration permits in Australia.

     CHINA.  We own a 35% interest in Block 05/36 in Bohai Bay, offshore China.
Our interest is subject to a 51% reversionary interest held by the Chinese
National Offshore Oil Company. The block covers more than 250,000 acres. There
currently is no production on the block. Since 2000, we have discovered two
fields on the block -- the CFD 12-1 and the CFD 12-1 South. We continue to
appraise the fields to determine if commercial oil reserves exist. In 2002, we
drilled two appraisal wells in the CFD 12-1 South Field, one of which was a dry
hole. The election to drill additional appraisal wells, the determination of
commerciality and, if warranted, the development of these non-operated fields,
are not within our complete control. We have not booked any proved reserves on
these fields to date.

PROVED RESERVES AND FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS

     The following table shows our estimated net proved oil and gas reserves and
the present value of estimated future after-tax net cash flows related to such
reserves as of December 31, 2002. The present value of estimated future
after-tax net cash flows was prepared using year-end oil and gas prices adjusted
for the location and quality of the reserves, discounted at 10% per year.
Application of year-end prices, as adjusted for location and quality, resulted
in weighted average year-end oil and gas prices of $4.74 per Mcf for gas and
$29.90 per Bbl for oil. This calculation does not include the effects of
hedging.

    Supplementary Oil and Gas Disclosures -- Standardized Measure of Discounted
    Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves."

     Actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves and future cash flows
from those reserves most likely will vary from the estimates set forth above.
Reserve and cash flow estimates rely on interpretations of data and require many
economic assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. For a discussion of
these interpretations and assumptions, see "Other Factors Affecting Our Business
and Financial Results" and "Forward Looking Statements" under Item 7 of this
report.

     As an operator of domestic oil and gas properties, we have filed Department
of Energy Form EIA-23, "Annual Survey of Oil and Gas Reserves," as required by
Public Law 93-275. There are differences between the reserves as reported on
Form EIA-23 and as reported above. The differences are attributable to the fact
that Form EIA-23 requires that an operator report on the total reserves
attributable to wells that are operated by it, without regard to ownership
(i.e., reserves are reported on a gross operated basis, rather than on a net
interest basis).

TITLE TO PROPERTIES

     We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing
properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is
customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, often little
investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Investigations
are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and
before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual
properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere
with the use, or affect the value, of the properties. Burdens on properties may
include:

     - customary royalty interests;

     - liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes;

     - obligations or duties under applicable laws,

     - development obligations under oil and gas leases; and

     - burdens such as net profits interests.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     We have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits in the ordinary
course of business. While the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with
certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     There were no matters submitted to a vote of our security holders during

New York Stock Exchange was $32.10 per share.

     As of March 14, 2003, there were approximately 2,100 holders of record of
our common stock.

     We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend
to do so in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain earnings for the future
operation and development of our business. Any future cash dividends to holders
of our common stock would depend on future earnings, capital requirements, our
financial condition and other factors determined by our Board of Directors. The
covenants contained in our credit facility and in the indenture governing our
8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 could restrict our ability to pay cash
dividends.

    1998, respectively. See Note 13, "Stock-Based Compensation -- Restricted
    Shares," to our consolidated financial statements.

(2) We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,
    "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," on January
    1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires us to record all derivative instruments as
    either assets or liabilities on our balance sheet and measure those
    instruments at fair value. For all periods prior to January 1, 2001, we
    accounted for commodity price hedging instruments in accordance with SFAS
    No. 80. The cumulative effective of the adoption is a reduction in net
    income of $4.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, and is shown as the
    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on our consolidated
    statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2001. On January 1,
    2002, we began assessing hedge effectiveness based on the total changes in
    cash flows on our collar and floor contracts as described by the Derivative
    Implementation Group (DIG) Issue G20, "Cash Flow Hedges: Assessing and
    Measuring the Effectiveness of a Purchased Option Used in a Cash Flow
    Hedge." Accordingly, we have elected to prospectively record subsequent
    changes in the fair value of our collar and floor contracts, including
    changes associated with time value, in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss). Gains or losses on these collar and floor contracts will be
    reclassified out of other comprehensive income (loss) and into earnings when
    the forecasted sale of production occurs. The expense recorded in 2002 is
    associated with the settlement of collar and floor contracts during the year
    ended December 31, 2002 and primarily reflects the reversal of time value
    gains of approximately $24.7 million recognized in earnings in 2001, prior
    to the adoption of DIG Issue G20. Had we applied DIG Issue G20 from the
    January 1, 2001 adoption date of SFAS 133, our income statement caption
    "Unrealized commodity derivative income (expense)" would have only reflected
    $0.5 million and $0.2 million of expense in 2002 and 2001, respectively,
    representing the ineffective portion of our hedges. As a result, net income
    would have increased by $18.6 million in 2002 and decreased by $16.3 million
    in 2001.

(3) We adopted SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition
    in Financial Statements," effective January 1, 2000. The adoption of SAB No.
    101 requires us to report crude oil inventory associated with our Australian
    offshore operations at the lower of cost or market, which was a change from
    our historical policy of recording such inventory at market value on the
    balance sheet date, net of estimated costs to sell. The cumulative effect of
    the change from the acquisition date of our Australian operations in July
    1999 through December 31, 1999 was a reduction in net income of $2.36
    million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and is shown as the cumulative effect
    of change in accounting principle on our consolidated statement of income
    for the year ended December 31, 2000.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

     Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on
prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and
acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. The preparation
of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our
reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities
and proved oil and gas reserves. We use the full cost method of accounting for
our oil and gas activities.

     OIL AND GAS PRICES.  Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Oil and gas
prices affect:

     - the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures;

     - our ability to borrow and raise additional capital;

     - the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce; and

     - the accounting for our oil and gas activities.

     We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated
future oil and gas production to, among other things, reduce our exposure to
commodity price fluctuations.

     RESERVE REPLACEMENT.  As is generally the case, our producing properties in
the Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast often have high initial production
rates, followed by steep declines. As a result, we must locate and develop or
acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production.
Substantial capital expenditures are required to find, develop and acquire oil
and gas reserves.

     SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES.  We believe the most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation
of our financial statements are:

     - remaining proved oil and gas reserves;

     - timing of our future drilling activities;

     - future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties;

     - allocating the purchase price associated with business combinations; and

     - the valuation of our derivative positions.

     Please see "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" and "Other Factors
Affecting Our Business and Financial Results" in this Item 7 for a more detailed
discussion of the foregoing matters.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     REVENUES.  All of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas
production and the settlement of hedging contracts associated with our
production. Our revenues may vary significantly from year to year as a result of
changes in commodity prices. Revenues for 2002 were 12% lower than 2001
primarily because of lower natural gas prices, a decrease in oil and condensate
production and downtime in the Gulf of Mexico associated with Tropical Storm
Isidore. The increase in revenues in 2001 when compared to 2000 was primarily
due to a 25% increase in production and higher realized natural gas prices.

(1) Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.

(2) For purposes of this table, average realized prices for natural gas and oil
    and condensate are presented net of all applicable transportation expenses,
    which reduced the realized price of natural gas by $0.03, $0.03 and $0.04
    for the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The realized price of
    oil and condensate was reduced by $0.28, $0.24 and $0.27 for the years ended
    2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Average realized prices include the
    effects of hedging.

     PRODUCTION.  Our total oil and gas production (stated on a natural gas
equivalent basis) increased 5% in 2002. Production increased because of
acquisitions (including EEX) and successful drilling efforts. These increases
were partially offset by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately one
Bcf of production in the first quarter of 2002 in response to low prices and by
the shut-in of four Bcfe in the second half of the year in response to storms in
the Gulf of Mexico. Gas production in 2001 increased primarily through our
acquisition of properties in the Mid-Continent, partially offset by our decision
to voluntarily curtail approximately five Bcfe in the fourth quarter of 2001 in
response to low commodity prices.

     Natural Gas.  Our 2002 natural gas production increased nearly 9% when
compared to 2001. The increase was the result of successful drilling in the Gulf
of Mexico and Mid-Continent and the acquisition of EEX in late 2002. Partially
offsetting this increase was the voluntary curtailment in the first quarter of
2002 in response to low prices and the shut-in during the second half of the
year related to storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Our 2001 natural gas production
increased 26% over 2000. About half of the production increase in 2001 came from
the Mid-Continent acquisition, which closed in January 2001. Our development
drilling programs in South Texas and the Gulf of Mexico also were major
contributors to our production growth. Gains in production were partially offset
by natural declines from other producing properties.

     Crude Oil and Condensate.  Our 2002 oil production decreased about 6% when
compared to 2001; primarily reflecting natural field declines in Australia and
the U.S. Partially offsetting these declines were increases at High Island 474,
Viosca Knoll 738 and other Gulf of Mexico fields. Our crude oil production in
2001 increased 21% over 2000 levels. This increase primarily related to our
early 2001 acquisition in the Mid-Continent and the success of our drilling
efforts, partially offset by natural declines in Australia.

     Our total operating expense for 2002, stated on a unit of production basis,
increased 2% over 2001. The increase was primarily related to the following
items.

     - Lease operating expense during 2001 included a $5.5 million non-recurring
       expense associated with a workover of a well at South Marsh Island 160.
       Without the effect of the workover, domestic lease operating expense
       would have increased 13%, or $0.04 per unit, as a result of several
       non-routine repairs to gathering lines and other offshore facilities in
       the Gulf of Mexico and a slight increase in well service costs in the
       Mid-Continent.

     - Although our domestic production subject to production taxes increased
       14% in 2002, our production tax expense decreased because of a 23% drop
       in natural gas prices for the year.

     - The increase in our DD&A rate was primarily related to the increased cost
       of reserve additions. The cost of reserve additions was adversely
       affected by the quantity of proved reserves added and increases in the
       cost of drilling goods and services and platforms and facilities
       construction during the first half of 2001. The increase is partially
       offset by our fourth quarter 2001 ceiling test writedown of our oil and
       gas properties.

     - General and administrative expense increased primarily because of a
       growing domestic workforce and the opening of our office in London,
       England.

     - Maintenance on our FPSOs resulted in higher Australian lease operating
       expense during 2001. This $2.1 million decrease from 2001 to 2002 was
       partially offset on a per unit basis by the 9% decrease in production in
       2002.

     - Australian capital expenditures are deductible against production taxes
       otherwise payable. Production taxes are due on a June 30 fiscal year. We
       accrue production taxes during the tax fiscal year based on our estimate
       of revenues and capital expenditures for the fiscal year. The estimate of
       such taxes for the current year reflects lower actual and anticipated
       future capital expenditures in Australia.

     - The increase in the Australian DD&A rate during 2002 was primarily a
       result of our unsuccessful exploratory drilling efforts in 2002 and 2001.

     - The significant increase in Australian general and administrative expense
       for 2002 relates to costs incurred in connection with the relocation of
       the previous manager of our Australian operations to our Tulsa, Oklahoma
       office and the relocation of the current manager of our Australian
       operations from Houston, Texas to Perth, Australia. On a per unit basis,
       the increase is magnified by the decline in our production in Australia.

(1) Stock compensation charges were $2,751, or $0.02 per Mcfe, for 2001 and
    $3,047, or $0.02 per Mcfe, for 2000. Total operating expense inclusive of
    these charges was $452,536, or $2.58 per Mcfe, for 2001 and $304,910, or
    $2.18 per Mcfe, for 2000.

     Our total operating expense (exclusive of the ceiling test writedowns in
2000 and 2001) for 2001, stated on a unit of production basis, increased 19%
over 2000 because of higher lease operating, production tax, DD&A and G&A
expenses. The reasons for these increases are described below.

     - The increased lease operating expense per Mcfe reflected higher oilfield
       service costs in all our domestic focus areas and relatively higher
       Australian lease operating expense associated with the operation and
       maintenance of our two FPSOs.

     - The increase in production and other taxes was primarily related to
       higher natural gas prices, our expanding onshore Gulf Coast operations
       and the acquisition of our Mid-Continent properties in early 2001. The
       increase was partly offset by resource rent tax in Australia, which was
       33% lower in 2001 compared to 2000 due to unsuccessful drilling efforts.

     - The increase in the domestic DD&A rate was primarily related to lower
       than expected reserve additions from several wells, increases in the cost
       of drilling goods and services and platforms and

                                        20
<PAGE>

       facilities construction and the completion of several higher cost wells.
       The increase in the Australian DD&A rate was primarily a result of our
       unsuccessful drilling activities in 2000.

     - The increase on a unit of production basis in G&A expense primarily was
       due to our growing workforce. Performance-based compensation, excluding
       stock compensation expense, was negatively impacted by the fourth quarter
       2001 ceiling test writedown. Performance-based compensation, a component
       of general and administrative expense, was $11.6 million, or $0.07 per
       Mcfe, in 2001 compared to $12.8 million, or $0.09 per Mcfe, in 2000.

     WRITEDOWN OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES.  We did not writedown any of our oil
and gas properties in 2002. At December 31, 2002, we had $44.6 million of other
international costs that were not subject to amortization. These costs primarily
represent our exploration efforts in China's Bohai Bay. We continue to appraise
the commerciality of our two field discoveries -- CFD 12-1 and CFD 12-1 South.
We have not yet booked any reserves associated with these discoveries. We are
not the operator of and do not own a controlling interest in these fields. As a
result, we do not control the appraisal and determination of commerciality of
these fields. If we determine that one or both of these fields are not
commercially viable, we will likely be required to impair the value of our
assets in this area.

     At December 31, 2001, the unamortized cost of our domestic oil and gas
properties exceeded the cost center ceiling. In accordance with full cost
accounting rules, we recorded a domestic ceiling test writedown at December 31,
2001 of $106 million ($68 million after-tax). Based on an interim interpretation
from the SEC that is applicable to all companies that use the full cost method
of accounting, the full cost ceiling test impairment calculations took into
account the effects of hedging. This interim interpretation, which is subject to
further consideration by the SEC before it is finalized, requires that certain
conditions be met in order to take into account the effects of hedging in the
calculation of full cost ceiling test impairment, including that the hedges
qualify under SFAS 133 and are documented and designated as such and that the
policy be applied on a consistent basis whether or not the hedged price is
higher than the current market price. The writedown would have been $184 million
($118 million after-tax) if we had not used hedge adjusted prices.

     In 2002, interest expense increased in part because of higher debt levels
outstanding under our credit arrangements. Interest expense also increased as a
result of debt incurred in connection with EEX acquisition in late November
2002. In August 2002, we issued $250 million principal amount of our 8 3/8%
Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 to finance a portion of the acquisition.
Interest that accrued prior to the closing of the acquisition was capitalized as
a cost of the transaction. Following the acquisition, EEX retained the
obligations associated with its secured notes (which accrue interest at rate of
7.54% per year) and a forward gas sales contract valued at approximately $60
million with an effective interest rate of 9.5% per year. In 2001, total
interest expense was higher than 2000 due to borrowings related to our
acquisition in the Mid-Continent and the issuance of $175 million principal of
our 7 5/8% Senior Notes in February 2001. In 2000, our interest expense included
interest from borrowings in January 2000 to finance our acquisition of three
producing properties in South Texas for $139 million.

     UNREALIZED COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INCOME (EXPENSE).  As a result of our
adoption of SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001, we are now required to
record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The $24.8
million of unrealized income for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily
reflects the change in the time value of our open hedging contracts. In 2002,
the unrealized expense of $29.1 million represents the settlement of those same
hedging contracts and primarily reflects the reversal of the time value gains
that were previously recognized during 2001.

     TAXES.  The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000 was 33%, 35% and 34%, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2002 was
less than the statutory tax rate primarily due to a $3.1 million tax benefit
resulting from revised tax legislation enacted in Australia in 2002. The
effective tax rate was less than the statutory tax rate in 2000 because the
valuation allowance on our Australian net operating loss carryforwards was
reduced by $2.3 million primarily as a result of a substantial increase in
estimated taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income can be
significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices, estimates of
the timing and amount of future production and estimates of future operating and
capital costs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

  CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS.

     Our annual capital budget is established at the beginning of each year.
Because of the nature of the properties we own, only a small portion of our
capital budget is nondiscretionary. The size of our budget is driven by expected
cash flow from operations. Actual levels of capital expenditures may vary
significantly due to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas
prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services
and the extent to which proved properties are acquired.

     Based on current commodity prices and our hedges, we currently anticipate
that our cash flow will exceed our capital budget (which excludes acquisitions)
by more than $100 million in 2003. This excess should allow us to pay down debt
and other obligations or repurchase shares of our common stock during the year.

     CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS.  We maintain our reserve-based revolving credit
facility with Chase Manhattan Bank, as agent. The banks participating in the
facility have committed to lend us up to $425 million. The amount available
under the facility is subject to a calculated borrowing base determined by banks
holding 75% of the aggregate commitments. The borrowing base is reduced by the
principal amount of outstanding senior notes ($300 million at March 14, 2003),
30% of the principal amount of any outstanding senior subordinated notes (a
reduction of $75 million at March 14, 2003), the outstanding principal amount of
the secured notes ($46 million at March 14, 2003) and an agreed valuation for
the gas sales obligation ($72.5 million at March 14, 2003). The borrowing base
will be redetermined at least semi-annually and, after reduction for the
foregoing items, was $236.5 million at March 14, 2003. No assurances can be
given that the banks will not elect to redetermine the borrowing base in the
future. The facility contains restrictions on the payment of dividends and the
incurrence of debt as well as other customary covenants and restrictions. The
facility matures on January 23, 2004. We expect to complete an amendment of the
facility during the first quarter of 2003 that would extend the maturity to
January 23, 2005.

     We also have money market lines of credit with various banks in an amount
limited by our credit facility to $40 million. At March 14, 2003, we had
outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of $130 million and outstanding
borrowings under our money market lines of $4 million. Consequently, at March
14, 2003, we had approximately $142.5 million of available capacity under our
credit arrangements.

     At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the interest rate was 2.737% and 3.25%,
respectively, for LIBOR based loans under our credit facility and 2.615% and
3.00%, respectively, for the loans outstanding under our money market lines of
credit.

<PAGE>

     WORKING CAPITAL.  Our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the
timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements.
Generally, we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit
arrangements. As a result, we often have a working capital deficit or a
relatively small amount of positive working capital. We had a working capital
deficit of $57.0 million as of December 31, 2002. This compares to a working
capital surplus of $65.6 million at the end of 2001 and $38.5 million at the end
of 2000. Our 2002 working capital deficit included an $11.2 million note payment
due January 2003 and accrued severance costs associated with the EEX
acquisition.

     CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS.  Our net cash flows from operations in 2002
declined 20% when compared to 2001. The decrease is primarily due to lower gas
prices and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by
higher production volumes. Our net cash flows from operations were $502.4
million in 2001 and $316.4 million in 2000. The increase in 2001 over 2000 is
primarily attributable to higher commodity prices and increased production
volumes, offset by increased operating expenses.

     CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  Our 2002 capital spending was $908 million, a 6%
increase over the previous year. The largest component of our capital spending
was the $571 million EEX acquisition. In 2002, we also invested $150 in U.S.
development, $106 million in domestic exploration, $53 million in other domestic
acquisitions and $28 million internationally. In 2001, our capital spending
totaled $855 million, including $435 million in acquisitions. The largest
component of acquisition spending was our first quarter acquisition in the
Mid-Continent. In 2001, we invested $302 million in development, $97 million in
domestic exploration and $21 million internationally. Total spending in 2000 was
$379 million. Our 2000 capital spending program included $139 million for
acquisitions, $129 million for development, $91 million for domestic exploration
and $20 million for international activities.

     We budgeted $450 million for capital spending, excluding uncompleted
acquisitions, in 2003. We expect that 55-60% of this budget will be invested in
the Gulf of Mexico (including deepwater), 35-40% in onshore U.S. and the balance
in international projects. We anticipate that our capital expenditure budget for
2003 will be funded from cash flow from operations. To the extent that cash
receipts during the year are slower than capital needs, we will make up the
short fall with borrowings under our credit arrangements. Actual levels of
capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors, including the
extent to which proved properties are acquired, drilling results, oil and gas
prices, industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and
services. We continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities; however,
the timing, size and purchase price of acquisitions are unpredictable.
Historically, we have completed several acquisitions of varying sizes each year.
Depending on the timing of an acquisition, we may spend additional capital
during the year of acquisition for drilling and development activities on the
acquired properties.

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

     The table below summarizes our significant contractual cash payment
obligations and commitments, other than hedging contracts, by maturity as of
December 31, 2002. Hedging contracts are excluded because they are sensitive to
future changes in commodity prices and other factors. See "Hedging" below.

(1) Our capacity under our credit facility is available to repay current amounts
    due under the gas sales obligation and our money market lines of credit and,
    therefore, these obligations have been classified as long-term on our
    consolidated balance sheet.

(2) The principal payment on the secured notes of $11.2 million due and paid in
    January 2003 is classified on our consolidated balance sheet as a current
    liability.

(3) See Note 16, "Commitment and Contingencies -- Lease Commitments," to our
    consolidated financial statements.

     CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS.  Please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Credit
Arrangements" in this Item 7 for a description of our bank revolving credit
facility and money market lines of credit.

     SENIOR NOTES.  In February 2001, we issued $175 million aggregate principal
amount of our 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011 priced (at 99.931% of par) with a
yield to maturity of 7.635%. Net proceeds from the offering of $173.1 million
were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility
incurred in connection with our January 2001 Mid-Continent acquisition. In
October 1997, we issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.45%
Senior Notes due 2007. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.

     Our senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank
equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations. We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before
their maturity at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indentures governing our
senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:

     - incur debt secured by certain liens;

     - enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and

     - enter into merger or consolidation transactions.

                                        24
<PAGE>

The indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our
indebtedness at any time in the future, then we will cause our senior notes to
be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary.

     SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES.  On August 13, 2002, we sold $250 million
aggregate principal amount of our 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012
priced with a yield to maturity of 8.50%. The net proceeds from the offering of
approximately $241.8 million were used to repay EEX debt that became due at the
closing of the acquisition and to pay transaction costs. Interest on the notes
is payable semi-annually. Interest accruing prior to the closing of the EEX
acquisition was capitalized as a cost of the transaction. The notes are
unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment
to all of our present and future senior indebtedness. We may redeem some or all
of the notes at any time on or after August 15, 2007 at a redemption price
stated in the indenture governing the notes. Prior to August 15, 2007, we may
redeem all but not part of the notes at a redemption price based on a make-whole
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition,
before August 15, 2005, we may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount
of the notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of our common stock at
108.375% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
redemption.

     The indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits our ability
to, among other things:

     - incur additional debt;

     - make restricted payments;

     - pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock;

     - make certain investments;

     - create liens;

     - make certain dispositions of assets;

     - engage in transactions with affiliates; and

     - engage in mergers, consolidations and certain sales of assets.

     SECURED NOTES.  In the second quarter of 2001, EEX assumed the obligations
under the secured notes in connection with the termination of two leveraged
leasing arrangements. The notes accrue interest at a rate of 7.54% per year and
are secured by the floating production system and pipelines described in Note 4,
"Oil and Gas Assets -- Assets Held for Sale," to our consolidated financial
statements. Redemption of the notes prior to 2006 may require us to pay
make-whole premiums. Principal is payable in annual installments on January 2 of
each year (except 2006) with the final installment due in 2009.

     The following is a summary of principal amounts by year of maturity at
December 31, 2002 (in thousands):

     GAS SALES OBLIGATION.  In 1999, EEX entered into a gas forward sales
contract with Bob West Treasure L.L.C. (BWT), an affiliate of Enron
Corporation,. Pursuant to the gas sales contract, EEX committed to deliver
approximately 50 Bcfe of production to BWT in exchange for proceeds of $105
million. BWT receives an adjusted market price as the volumes are delivered. EEX
also has an obligation to market the delivered volumes of gas for BWT. Under the
terms of the gas sales contract, EEX is required to make a cash payment if the
committed gas volumes are not delivered. Additionally, BWT holds liens on
certain of EEX's oil and gas properties as security if the committed gas volumes
are not delivered or the cash payments are not made.

     Payments under the gas sales contract are amortized as the underlying gas
is delivered under the interest method using an interest rate of 9.5%. As of
December 31, 2002, the unamortized balance was approximately $60 million and the
fair value of the remaining obligation was approximately $64.5 million. The
interest portion of the payment is included as a component of interest expense
in our consolidated income statement.

     EEX also guaranteed BWT's performance under certain swap agreements between
BWT and Enron entered into concurrently with the gas sales contract. If BWT
fails to make payments under the swap agreements, EEX must perform under the
guarantee by paying Enron on BWT's behalf. The maximum amount that EEX could be
required to pay under this guarantee is not determinable and would depend on the
settlement value of the swaps at the time of any BWT default. BWT, which is
outside of the Enron bankruptcy proceedings, continues to meet its contractual
obligations under its swap agreements and, therefore, EEX has not been required
to perform under this guarantee.

     On March 6, 2003, we reached an agreement with BWT, certain lenders and
insurers of BWT and the unsecured creditors committee of Enron to terminate
EEX's gas sales contract. The agreement, which is subject to the final approval
of the Enron bankruptcy court, provides for the termination of the gas sales
contract, the swaps entered into in connection with the gas sales contract and
any other agreements between EEX, BWT and Enron related to the gas sales
contract, including the guarantee and all liens and other security interests on
EEX's properties, in exchange for a payment to BWT representing:

     - the remaining unamortized obligation under the gas sales contract;

     - the fair market value of the swaps;

     - an agreed upon value of $0.5 million for BWT's limited membership
       interest in an EEX subsidiary that BWT acquired in conjunction with the
       gas sales contract.

     CONVERTIBLE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES.  In August 1999, a subsidiary of
our company that is a Delaware business trust issued $143.75 million (2.875
million securities having a liquidation preference of $50 each) of 6.5%
Cumulative Quarterly Income Convertible Preferred Securities, Series A. The
proceeds from the issuance of these securities (commonly referred to as trust
preferred securities) were used to purchase $143.75 million of our company's
6.5% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2029. The interest terms and
payment dates of the debentures correspond to the distribution terms of the
trust preferred securities. The debentures are eliminated in our consolidated
financial statements. The trust preferred securities accrue and pay
distributions quarterly in arrears at a rate of 6.5% per annum on the stated
liquidation of the securities. The trust preferred securities are convertible at
the option of the holder at any time into our common stock at the rate of 1.3646
shares of our common stock per trust preferred security -- the equivalent of a
conversion price of $36.64 per share of our common stock. The trust preferred
securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the debentures in August
2029, and on a proportionate basis to the extent of any earlier redemption of
the debentures by us. The debentures are redeemable by us at any time. For a
more detailed description of the trust preferred securities, see Note 9,
"Convertible Preferred Securities of Newfield Financial Trust I," to our
consolidated financial statements.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

     On May 4, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the
expenditure of up to $50 million to repurchase shares of our common stock.
Through December 31, 2001, we had purchased 823,000 shares for total
consideration of $24.7 million at an average of $29.97 per share. During 2002,
no shares were purchased under this program. In February 2003, our Board of
Directors authorized the expenditure of up to $50 million from that date forward
to repurchase shares of our common stock. As a result, additional repurchases
may be effected from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws
through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the market or in privately
negotiated transactions. No limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase
program. Subject to applicable securities laws, purchases will be at times and
in amounts, as we deem appropriate. As of February 28, 2003, no shares had been
purchased during the first quarter of 2003.

HEDGING

     We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated
oil and gas production for the next 18-24 months as part of our risk management
program. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have
adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and
return on some of our acquisitions. Our decision on the quantity and price at
which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current
and future market conditions. Approximately 84% of our 2002 production was
subject to hedge positions. In 2001, 68% of our production was subject to hedge
positions, compared to 45% in 2000. While the use of these hedging arrangements
limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future
revenues from favorable price movements. The use of hedging transactions also
involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial
terms of such transactions. At December 31, 2002, Bank of Montreal, Morgan
Stanley and J Aron & Company were the counterparties with respect to 61% of our
future hedged production. Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives in
accordance with SFAS No. 133. Please see the discussion in Note 5, "Commodity
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to our consolidated financial
statements appearing in this report.

     NATURAL GAS.  As of December 31, 2002, we held the commodity derivative
instruments set forth in the table below as cash flow hedges of the forecasted
sale of our U.S. natural gas production for 2003 through 2005. This table
includes hedges that were entered into by EEX prior to its acquisition.

     Between December 31, 2002 and March 14, 2003, we entered into the
additional natural gas price hedging contracts set forth in the table below. The
addition of these hedges, along with those already in place, resulted in
approximately 77% of our 2003 forecasted natural gas production being hedged. We
continue to evaluate additional hedging transactions.

     We believe there is no material basis risk with respect to our natural gas
price hedging contracts because substantially all our hedged natural gas
production is sold at market prices that historically have highly correlated to
the settlement price.

     OIL AND CONDENSATE.  As of December 31, 2002, we held the commodity
derivative instruments set forth in the table below as cash flow hedges of the
forecasted sale of our U.S. Gulf Coast oil production for 2003 through 2005.

     Between December 31, 2002 and March 14, 2003 we have entered into
additional oil price hedging contracts with respect to our Gulf Coast oil
production set forth in the table below. The addition of these hedges, along
with those already in place, resulted in approximately 59% of our budgeted
domestic oil production being hedged through December 2003. We continue to
evaluate additional hedging transactions for 2003 and future years.

     Because substantially all of our U.S. Gulf Coast oil production is sold at
current market prices that historically have highly correlated to the NYMEX West
Texas Intermediate price, we believe that we have no

                                        29
<PAGE>

material basis risk with respect to these transactions. The actual cash price we
receive, however, generally is about $2.00 per barrel less than the NYMEX West
Texas Intermediate price when adjusted for location and quality differences. Our
Australian production is not hedged.

     Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon
reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. The estimated fair value of these
transactions is based upon various factors that include closing exchange prices
on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, volatility and the time value of
options. The calculation of the fair value of collars and floors requires the
use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

     The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported
assets, liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves. Described below are the
most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements, some
of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted
accounting principles. We also describe the most significant estimates and
assumptions we make in applying these policies. The accuracy of our estimates
and assumptions are sensitive to material changes in the future due to various
factors, many of which are beyond our control.

     For discussion purposes, we have divided our significant policies into
three categories. Set forth below is an overview of each of our significant
accounting policies by category.

     - WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES UNDER THE FULL COST
       METHOD.  This method of accounting requires the following significant
       estimates:

        - remaining proved oil and gas reserves;

        - costs withheld from amortization; and

        - future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties.

     - ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS REQUIRES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
       regarding the allocation of the purchase price.

     - ACCOUNTING FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES REQUIRES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
       regarding the valuation of hedge positions.

  OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES

     Accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special, unique rules.
Two generally accepted methods for accounting for oil and gas activities are
available  --  successful efforts and full cost. The most significant
differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and
the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized
and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires exploration
costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides
for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the
periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities.
Impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is
based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas
properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full
cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas
properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future
cash flows from the related proved reserves, using period-end prices and costs
and a 10% discount rate.

     FULL COST METHOD.  We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil
and gas activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in the acquisition,
exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost
centers (the amortization base) that are established on a country-by-country
basis. Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells,
dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs and delay rentals. Capitalized costs
also include salaries, employee benefits, costs of consulting services and other
expenses that are directly related to our oil and gas activities. Interest costs
related to unproved properties and properties under development also are
capitalized. Costs associated with production and general corporate

                                        30
<PAGE>

activities are expensed in the period incurred. The capitalized costs of our oil
and gas properties, plus an estimate of our future development and abandonment
costs, are amortized on a unit-of-production method based on our estimate of
total proved reserves. Amortization is calculated separately on a
country-by-country basis.

     PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES.  Our engineering estimates of proved oil and
gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates, including
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling
limitation. Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural
gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with
reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs
under period-end economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating
quantities of proved reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective
decisions in the evaluation of all geological, engineering and economic data for
each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over
time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity,
evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of
production under varying economic conditions. Changes in oil and gas prices,
operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result
in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves.

     Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization.  The quantities of estimated
proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of
depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future
expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward,
earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense. Likewise, if reserves
are revised downward, earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or
due to a ceiling test writedown.

     Full Cost Ceiling Limitation.  Under the full cost method, we are subject
to quarterly calculations of a "ceiling" or limitation on the amount of our oil
and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If the net
capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling,
we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess. If
required, it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders' equity in the period
of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods. The
ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil
and gas properties. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a
major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that
requires the most subjective judgments. Given the volatility of natural gas and
oil prices, it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net
cash flows from proved reserves will change in the near term. If natural gas and
oil prices decline, even if for only a short period of time, or if we have
downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that
writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future.

     While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the
associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the
discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The future net
revenues associated with our estimated proved reserves are not based on our
assessment of future prices or costs. The ceiling calculation dictates that
prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant.
However, we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to
the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required. Based on
an interim interpretation from the SEC, the full cost ceiling test impairment
calculations may take into consideration the effects of hedging if certain
conditions are met. See "Results of Operations -- Writedown of Oil and Gas
Properties" in this Item 7.

     COSTS WITHHELD FROM AMORTIZATION.  Unevaluated costs are excluded from our
amortization base until we have evaluated the properties associated with these
costs. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage, unamortized
seismic data, wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially
excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to
our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are
assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value. Leasehold
costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in
value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were
incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established. If a
reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet
been established, an impairment

                                        31
<PAGE>

requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling
results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information.

     Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the
transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount
of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors,
including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and
results of drilling on adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2002, we had
approximately $269 million of costs excluded from our amortization base. Because
the application of the full cost ceiling test at December 31, 2002 resulted in a
significant excess of the cost-center ceiling over the carrying value of our oil
and gas properties, inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs
in our amortization base, without adding any associated reserves, would not have
resulted in a ceiling test writedown. However, our future depletion rate will
increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated
reserves.

     FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND ABANDONMENT COSTS.  Future development costs include
costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves, including drilling costs and
the installation of production equipment. Future abandonment costs include costs
to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our offshore production platforms,
FPSOs, gathering systems, wells and related structures and restoration costs of
land and seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties
based upon the type of production structure, depth of water, reservoir
characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand for equipment, currently
available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering
consultants. Because these costs typically occur many years in the future,
estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make
estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous
factors, including changing technologies and the future political and regulatory
environment.

  ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     As part of our growth strategy, we actively pursue the acquisition of oil
and gas properties. The purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as
of the acquisition date, which may occur many months after the announcement
date. Therefore, while the consideration to be paid may be fixed, the fair value
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to change during the
period between the announcement date and the acquisition date. Our most
significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned
to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties. To the
extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired,
we would be required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill. Goodwill
is not amortized but must be evaluated periodically for impairment. We have not
recorded goodwill in connection with any of our previous acquisitions.

  HEDGING ACTIVITIES

     Beginning in 2001, the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments
are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. We have elected to designate all
of our derivative instruments as hedges against the price we will receive for
our future oil and natural gas production. We do not use derivative instruments
for trading purposes. Because our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, to
the extent that changes in their fair values offset changes in the expected cash
flows from our forecasted production, such amounts are not included in our
consolidated results of operations. Instead, they are recorded directly to
stockholders' equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced
and sold. To the extent the change in the fair value of the derivative exceeds
the change in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production, the change
is recorded in income in the period it occurs.

     VALUATION OF HEDGE POSITIONS.  In determining the amounts to be recorded,
we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the
associated hedged production at its physical location. Where necessary, we
adjust NYMEX prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of
future regional prices. Our estimates are based upon various factors that
include closing prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, volatility and
the time value of options. The calculation of the fair value of our option
contracts requires the use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
estimated future prices are

                                        32
<PAGE>

compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated
future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to
calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts. These pricing and
discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in
future price forecasts, regional price differences and interest rates. We
periodically validate our valuations using independent third-parties'
quotations.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations". This statement changes the method of accounting for costs
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets (e.g. oil & gas production
facilities, etc.) that we are obligated to incur. The statement requires that
the fair value of the obligation be recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the asset
retirement cost be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the associated
asset. Under our previous accounting method, we recognized the cost to abandon
our oil and gas properties over their productive lives on a unit-of-production
basis.

     We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003. A pre-tax cumulative
effect gain of approximately $8 million will be reported in our consolidated
statement of income on January 1, 2003. We will also report an increase in our
assets of approximately $160 million and an increase in our liabilities of
approximately $152 million. There will be no impact on our reported cash flows
as a result of adopting SFAS No. 143.

     In the second quarter of 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Recision of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections as of April 2002." This statement provides guidance for
income statement classifications of gains and losses on extinguishment of debt
and accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that
are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. Our adoption of SFAS No. 145 on
January 1, 2003 had no effect on our financial statements.

     In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS No. 146 requires
that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred and establishes that fair value is the
objective for initial measurement of the liability. The provisions of SFAS No.
146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002. Our adoption of SFAS 146 on January 1, 2003 had no effect on
our financial statements.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123."
SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of accounting for entities that elect
to transition from the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation to the fair value method. In addition, this statement amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosures in both annual
and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. We adopted
the disclosure provisions of this statement in our 2002 year-end financial
statements. We continue to apply the intrinsic value method of accounting for
our stock-based compensation plans.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be
recorded at fair value, which is different from the current practice of
recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, as
those terms are defined in SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." FIN 45
has a dual effective date. The initial recognition and measurement provisions
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements in the interpretation are
effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after
December 15, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of FIN No. 45 to have a
material effect on our financial statements. See Note 7, "Debt -- Gas Sales
Obligation," to our consolidated financial statements, regarding the guarantee
associated with the Gas Sales Obligation.

                                        33
<PAGE>

     In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51." The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to
provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved
through means other than through voting rights (these entities are referred to
as "variable interest entities" or "VIEs") and how to determine if business
enterprise should consolidate the VIE. This new model for consolidation applies
to an entity which either (1) the equity investors (if any) do not have a
controlling financial interest or (2) the equity investment at risk is
insufficient to finance that entity's activities without receiving additional
subordinated financial support from other parties. In addition, FIN 46 requires
that all enterprises with a significant variable interest in a VIE make
additional disclosures regarding their relationship with the VIE. We are
currently evaluating the impact of FIN No. 46 on our financial statements;
however we do not believe that we have any VIEs that will require consolidation
in our financial statements under this interpretation.

REGULATION

     WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LAWS THAT CAN AFFECT THE COST, MANNER OR
FEASIBILITY OF DOING BUSINESS. Exploration, development, production and sale of
oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international
regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with
environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation
include:

     - discharge permits for drilling operations;

     - drilling bonds;

     - reports concerning operations;

     - the spacing of wells;

     - unitization and pooling of properties; and

     - taxation.

     Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property
damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up
costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with these laws also
may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to
administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change
in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties,
suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

     FEDERAL REGULATION OF SALES AND TRANSPORTATION OF NATURAL
GAS.  Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in
interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by
Congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the FERC. In the
past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be
sold. Congress removed all price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales
of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. Congress could, however, reenact price
controls in the future.

     Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost
of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are
subject to extensive federal and state regulation. From 1985 to the present,
several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC
that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales.
In addition, the FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and
regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably
interstate natural gas transmission companies, that remain subject to the FERC's
jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of
gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory
changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas
industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light-handed regulation.

     The ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the FERC
since 1985 cannot be predicted. In addition, many aspects of these regulatory
developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and FERC final
decisions. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on

                                        34
<PAGE>

these matters. Some of the FERC's more recent proposals may, however, adversely
affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service
on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any
action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers
and marketers with which we compete.

     The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, or OCSLA, requires that all
pipelines operating on or across the Outer Continental Shelf, or the Shelf,
provide open-access, non-discriminatory service. Historically, the FERC has
opted not to impose regulatory requirements under its OCSLA authority on
gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act
jurisdiction. However, the FERC has issued Order No. 639, requiring that
virtually all non-proprietary pipeline transporters of natural gas on the Shelf
report information on their affiliations, rates and conditions of service. These
reporting requirements apply, in certain circumstances, to operators of
production platforms and other facilities on the Shelf with respect to gas
movements across such facilities. In a recent decision, the U.S. District Court
for the District of Columbia permanently enjoined the FERC from enforcing Order
No. 639, on the basis that the FERC did not possess the requisite rule-making
authority under the OCSLA for issuing Order No. 639. The FERC's appeal of the
court's decision is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit. We cannot predict the outcome of this appeal, nor can we
predict what further action the FERC will take with respect to this matter. In
addition, the FERC retains authority under OCSLA to exercise jurisdiction over
entities outside the reach of its Natural Gas Act jurisdiction if necessary to
ensure non-discriminatory access to service on the Shelf. We do not believe that
any FERC action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that materially
differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers, gatherers and
marketers with which we compete.

     Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas
industry are pending before Congress, the FERC and the courts. The natural gas
industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no
assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the
FERC and Congress will continue.

     FEDERAL REGULATION OF SALES AND TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL.  Our sales of
crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated and are made at market
prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell
such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of
service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act.
Certain regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years could result in an
increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products
pipelines. However, we do not believe that these regulations affect us any
differently than other natural gas producers.

     FEDERAL LEASES.  The majority of our U.S. operations are located on federal
oil and gas leases, which are administered by the MMS. These leases are issued
through competitive bidding, contain relatively standardized terms and require
compliance with detailed MMS regulations and orders pursuant to OCSLA (which are
subject to change by the MMS). For offshore operations, lessees must obtain MMS
approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the
commencement of such operations. In addition to permits required from other
agencies (such as the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the
Environmental Protection Agency), lessees must obtain a permit from the MMS
prior to the commencement of drilling. The MMS has promulgated regulations
requiring offshore production facilities located on the Shelf to meet stringent
engineering and construction specifications. The MMS also has regulations
restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas, and has proposed to amend
such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without
prior authorization. Similarly, the MMS has promulgated other regulations
governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal
of all production facilities. To cover the various obligations of lessees on the
Shelf, the MMS generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or
post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met. The
cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance
that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases. We are currently exempt
from the supplemental bonding requirements of the MMS. Under certain
circumstances, the MMS may require that our operations on federal leases be
suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially and
adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

                                        35
<PAGE>

     The MMS has issued a final rule that governs the calculation of royalties
and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases. This rule provides
that the MMS will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced
from federal leases. The lawfulness of the new rule has been challenged in
federal court. We cannot predict what action the MMS will take on this matter.
We believe that these rules will not have a material effect on our financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.

     STATE AND LOCAL REGULATION OF DRILLING AND PRODUCTION.  We own interests in
properties located onshore Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. We also
own interests in properties in the state waters offshore Texas and Louisiana.
These states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among
other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding
requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of
wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration
of properties upon which wells are drilling and the plugging and abandonment of
wells. The laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and
conservation matters, including the handling and disposing of waste materials,
the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of
wells which may be drilled, unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties
and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some
states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas.

     ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.  Our operations are subject to numerous laws and
regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or
otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these
laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and
criminal penalties, the obligation to perform investigatory or remedial
activities or the imposition of injunctive relief. Environmental laws and
regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more
stringent over time. Both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has
been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted.
To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that
prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental
protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas
industry in general, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.

     The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, imposes regulations on "responsible
parties" related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages
resulting from spills in U.S. waters. A "responsible party" includes the owner
or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline, or the lessee or
permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns
strict, joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal
costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply
in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the
spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from
violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation, or if the
party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup. Even if
applicable, the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible
party to pay all removal costs, plus up to $75 million in other damages for
offshore facilities and up to $350 million for onshore facilities. Few defenses
exist to the liability imposed by OPA. Failure to comply with ongoing
requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a
responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions.

     OPA also requires operators in the Gulf of Mexico to demonstrate to the MMS
that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for
certain costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill. Under OPA and
MMS regulations, responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they
possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and
restoration costs of at least $10 million for an oil spill in state waters and
at least $35 million for an oil spill in federal waters. Since we currently have
extensive operations in federal waters, we currently provide a total of $150
million in financial assurance to MMS. This $150 million in financial assurance
is provided through $35 million in guaranteed net worth and $115 million in
insurance.

     In addition to OPA, our discharges to waters of the U.S. are further
limited by the federal Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws. CWA
prohibits any discharge into waters of the United States except in compliance
with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies. Failure to
comply with CWA, including discharge limits on permits issued pursuant to CWA,
may also result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. OPA
and CWA also require the preparation of oil spill response plans.

                                        36
<PAGE>

     OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental
protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the Shelf. Specific
design and operational standards may apply to vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles
and structures operating or located on the Shelf. Violations of lease conditions
or regulations issued pursuant to OCSLA can result in substantial
administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court
injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases.

     The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, generally regulates
the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Although RCRA specifically excludes
from the definition of hazardous waste "drilling fluids, produced waters and
other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude
oil, natural gas or geothermal energy," legislation has been proposed in
Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration
and production wastes as "hazardous wastes," which would make the reclassified
wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up
requirements. If such legislation were to be enacted, it could increase our
operating costs, as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general.
Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents,
laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste.

     The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,
also known as the "Superfund" law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or
the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are
considered to have contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into
the environment. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous
substances under the Superfund law may be subject to joint and several liability
for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released
into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not
uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for
personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances
released into the environment. We currently own or lease onshore properties that
have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of
years. Many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties
whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not
under our control. These properties and any wastes that may have been disposed
or released on them may be subject to the Superfund law, RCRA and analogous
state laws, and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate
such properties.

     We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable
U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and that
continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Our
foreign operations are potentially subject to similar governmental controls and
restrictions relating to the environment. We believe that we are in substantial
compliance with any such foreign requirements pertaining to the environment.
There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will
not change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents will not occur or past
non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations will not be discovered.

OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS

     OIL AND GAS PRICES FLUCTUATE WIDELY, AND LOW PRICES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD
OF TIME ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.  Our
revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing
prices for oil and gas. These prices also affect the amount of cash flow
available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise
additional capital. The amount we can borrow under our credit facility is
subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on changing expectations of
future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we
can economically produce.

     Among the factors that can cause fluctuations are:

     - the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;

     - the price and availability of alternative fuels;

     - weather conditions;

     - the level of consumer demand;

                                        37
<PAGE>

     - the price of foreign imports;

     - world-wide economic conditions;

     - political conditions in oil and gas producing regions; and

     - domestic and foreign governmental regulations.

     OUR USE OF OIL AND GAS PRICE HEDGING CONTRACTS INVOLVES CREDIT RISK AND MAY
LIMIT FUTURE REVENUES FROM PRICE INCREASES AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT
FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR NET INCOME.  We use hedging transactions with respect to a
portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and
to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging
transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use may also
limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve
the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations.

     OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO FIND, DEVELOP AND ACQUIRE OIL
AND GAS RESERVES.  As is generally the case, our producing properties in the
Gulf of Mexico and the onshore Gulf Coast often have high initial production
rates, followed by steep declines. To maintain production levels, we must locate
and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those depleted by
production. Without successful exploration or acquisition activities, our
reserves, production and revenues will decline rapidly. We may be able to find
and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost. In addition,
substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves. If lower oil and
gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations
being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow under our credit
arrangements, we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to locate and
develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves.

     ACTUAL QUANTITIES OF RECOVERABLE OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS
FROM THOSE RESERVES MOST LIKELY WILL VARY FROM OUR ESTIMATES.  Estimating
accumulations of oil and gas is complex. The process relies on interpretations
of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent,
quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires certain
economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas
prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and
availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:

     - the quality and quantity of available data;

     - the interpretation of that data;

     - the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and

     - the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.

     The proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on
estimates we prepared. Estimates prepared by others might differ materially from
our estimates.

     Actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves, future production,
oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating
expenses most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance
could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. In
addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production
history, results of exploration and development and prevailing oil and gas
prices. Our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on
adjacent properties.

     You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is
the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves. In
accordance with SEC requirements, we generally base the estimated discounted
future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of
the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower
than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate.

     IF OIL AND GAS PRICES DECREASE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE WRITEDOWNS. We
may be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties
when oil and gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments
to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development
costs or deterioration in our exploration results.

                                        38
<PAGE>

     We capitalize the costs to acquire, find and develop our oil and gas
properties under the full cost accounting method. The net capitalized costs of
our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future
net cash flows from proved reserves, using period-end oil and gas prices and a
10% discount factor, plus the lower of cost or fair market value for unproved
properties. If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this
limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. We review the
carrying value of our properties quarterly, based on prices in effect (including
the value of our hedge positions) as of the end of each quarter or as of the
time of reporting our results. The carrying value of oil and gas properties is
computed on a country-by-country basis. Therefore, while our properties in one
country may be subject to a writedown, our properties in other countries could
be unaffected. Once incurred, a writedown of oil and gas properties is not
reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase.

     WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS.  The successful
acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors,
including:

     - recoverable reserves;

     - future oil and gas prices;

     - operating costs; and

     - potential environmental and other liabilities.

     The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection
with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we
believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not
reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become
sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and
capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well,
and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even
when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller
may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against
all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual
indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an "as
is" basis.

     COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO
CONDUCT OPERATIONS.  Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense,
particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and proved
undeveloped acreage. Major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid
for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as for the equipment and labor
required to operate and develop their properties. Many of our competitors have
financial resources that are substantially greater than ours, which may
adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies.

     DRILLING IS A HIGH-RISK ACTIVITY.  Our future success will depend on the
success of our drilling program. In addition to the numerous operating risks
described in more detail below, these activities involve the risk that no
commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered. In addition,
we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing
and producing wells. Furthermore, our drilling operations may be curtailed,
delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including:

     - unexpected drilling conditions;

     - pressure or irregularities in formations;

     - equipment failures or accidents;

     - adverse weather conditions;

     - compliance with governmental requirements; and

     - shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery
       of equipment.

                                        39
<PAGE>

     THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS INVOLVES MANY OPERATING RISKS THAT CAN CAUSE
SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES; INSURANCE MAY NOT PROTECT US AGAINST ALL THESE RISKS. These
risks include:

     - fires;

     - explosions;

     - blow-outs;

     - uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, formation water or drilling fluids;

     - natural disasters;

     - pipe or cement failures;

     - casing collapses;

     - embedded oilfield drilling and service tools;

     - abnormally pressured formations; and

     - environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, pipeline
       ruptures and discharges of toxic gases.

     If any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result
of:

     - injury or loss of life;

     - severe damage or destruction of property, natural resources and
       equipment;

     - pollution and other environmental damage;

     - investigatory and clean-up responsibilities;

     - regulatory investigation and penalties;

     - suspension of our operations; and

     - repairs to resume operations.

If we experience any of these problems, our ability to conduct operations could
be adversely affected.

     Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to
the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from
hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause
substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could
incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available
for our exploration and development programs and acquisitions, or result in loss
of properties.

     We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks
and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of
available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition,
pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a
significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by
insurance, it could adversely affect us.

     WE HAVE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS.  We currently have
international activities and we continue to evaluate and pursue new
opportunities for international expansion in select areas. Ownership of property
interests and production operations in areas outside the United States is
subject to the various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may
include:

     - currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;

     - loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of expropriation,
       nationalization, war or insurrection;

     - increases in taxes and governmental royalties;

     - renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and
       quasi-governmental agencies;

                                        40
<PAGE>

     - changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based
       companies;

     - labor problems; and

     - other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over
       our international operations.

     Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and
policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment.
In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations, we may
be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be
successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of
the United States.

     EXPLORATION IN DEEPWATER INVOLVES GREATER OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RISKS
THAN EXPLORATION AT SHALLOWER DEPTHS.  These risks could result in substantial
losses. Deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently
developed technologies and involve a higher risk of mechanical failure. We will
likely experience significantly higher drilling costs for any deepwater wells
that we drill. In addition, much of the deepwater play lacks the physical and
oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result,
development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and require
substantial capital investment, resulting in significant financial and operating
risks.

     In addition, as we carry out our drilling program is deepwater, it is
likely that we will not initially serve as operator of the wells. As a result,
we may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these
properties or their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other
working interest owners for these deepwater projects and our limited ability to
influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our
targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities in the
deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. The success and timing of drilling and
exploitation activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a
number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:

     - the timing and amount of capital expenditures;

     - the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment,
       support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and
       qualified operating personnel;

     - the operator's expertise and financial resources;

     - approval of other participants in drilling wells; and

     - selection of technology.

     OTHER INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS COMPANIES' LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MAY
CHANGE OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS.  Many independent oil and gas
companies have limited access to the capital necessary to finance their
activities. As a result, some of the other working interest owners of our wells
may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they
become due. These problems could cause us to change, suspend or terminate our
drilling and development plans with respect to the affected project.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

     This report contains information that is forward-looking or relates to
anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures, the
availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures, estimates of
proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves, wells planned
to be drilled in the future, our financial position, business strategy and other
plans and objectives for future operations. Although we believe that the
expectations reflected in this information are reasonable, this information is
based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous
uncertainties. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due
to many factors, including drilling results, oil and gas prices, industry
conditions, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs
and other support services the availability of capital resources and other
factors affecting our business described above under the captions "Regulation"
and "Other Factors Affecting Our Business." All written and oral forward-looking
statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly
qualified in their entirety by such factors.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices, interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below.

OIL AND GAS PRICES

     We generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated
oil and gas production for the next 18-24 months as part of our risk management
program. We use hedging to reduce price volatility, help ensure that we have
adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and
return on some of our acquisitions. Our decision on the quantity and price at
which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current
and future market conditions. While hedging limits the downside risk of adverse
price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price
movements. For a further discussion of our hedging activities, see the
information under the caption "Hedging" in Item 7 of this report.

INTEREST RATES

     At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $616 million in long-term fixed
rate debt. This debt was comprised of:

     - $125 million of 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007;

     - $175 million of 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011;

     - $250 million of 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012; and

     - $66 million of secured notes with an interest rate of 7.54%.

     Additionally, we had $144 million of convertible trust preferred securities
bearing a fixed distribution rate of 6.5%. At December 31, 2002, we also had $60
million remaining on a gas sales obligation that we assumed with the purchase of
EEX. Payment under this obligation is amortized on the interest method using an
interest rate of 9.5%.

     Our year-end 2002 variable rate debt consisted of $28 million borrowed
under our bank revolving credit facility and $8 million borrowed under our money
market lines of credit. The interest rate at December 31, 2002 for our LIBOR
based loans under our credit facility was 2.737% and the interest rate for the
money market lines was 2.615%.

     We considered our interest rate exposure at year-end 2002 to be minimal
because the majority, about 86%, of our long-term debt obligations were at fixed
rates. The impact on annual cash flow of a 10% change in the floating rate
applicable to our variable rate debt would be $0.1 million.

     At December 31, 2002, we had no open interest rate hedge positions to
affect our exposure to changes in interest rates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

     Our cash flow from certain international operations is based on the U.S.
dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. We consider our
current risk exposure to exchange rate movements, based on net cash flows, to be
immaterial. We did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign
currencies at December 31, 2002.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Newfield Exploration Company:

     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newfield
Exploration Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of assessing hedge effectiveness of its collar and
floor contracts effective January 1, 2002 and its method of accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities effective January 1, 2001.
Additionally, as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed its method of accounting for its crude oil inventories in
connection with its adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, "Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements" effective January 1, 2000.

                          NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

  ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

     We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration,
development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties. Our company
was founded in 1989 and we acquired our first property in 1990. Our initial
focus area was the Gulf of Mexico. In the mid-1990s, we began to expand our
operations to other select areas. Our areas of operation now include the U.S.
onshore Gulf Coast, West Texas, the Anadarko Basin and offshore northwest
Australia.

     Our financial statements include the accounts of Newfield Exploration
Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unless otherwise
specified or the context otherwise requires, all references in these notes to
"Newfield," "we," "us" or "our" are to Newfield Exploration Company and its
direct and indirect subsidiaries.

     On November 26, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
EEX Corporation, and EEX and its direct and indirect subsidiaries became direct
or indirect subsidiaries of our company. The acquisition has been accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting. As a result, the assets and liabilities
of EEX and its subsidiaries have been included in our December 31, 2002 balance
sheet and our results of operations and cash flows for 2002 include 35 days
(November 27 to December 31, 2002) of activity for EEX and its subsidiaries.

     As is common in the context of acquisitions, in these notes we sometimes
refer to our assumption of liabilities or obligations of EEX or EEX subsidiaries
as a result of the acquisition. Because our balance sheet is prepared on a
consolidated basis that includes all of the subsidiaries of Newfield Exploration
Company, the liabilities and obligations EEX and its subsidiaries are included
in our consolidated balance sheet. However, neither Newfield Exploration Company
nor any of its pre-acquisition subsidiaries legally assumed any liabilities or
obligations of EEX or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the
acquisition. At the time of the acquisition of EEX, we changed EEX's name to
Newfield Exploration Gulf Coast Inc. However, to assist readers' understanding
of these notes, we continue to refer to this entity as EEX.

  DEPENDENCE ON OIL AND GAS PRICES

     As an independent oil and gas producer, our revenue, profitability and
future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for
natural gas, oil and condensate, which are dependent upon numerous factors
beyond our control, such as economic, political and regulatory developments and
competition from other sources of energy. The energy markets have historically
been very volatile, and there can be no assurance that oil and gas prices will
not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. A substantial or extended
decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations, cash flows and our access to capital
and on the quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced.

  USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities;
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements; the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period; and the reported amounts of proved oil and gas reserves. Actual results
could differ from these estimates. Our most significant financial estimates are
based on remaining proved oil and gas reserves.

  RECLASSIFICATIONS

     Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year's reported amounts
in order to conform with the current year presentation. These reclassifications
did not impact our net income or stockholders' equity.

                          NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  REVENUE RECOGNITION

     Revenues are recorded when title passes to the customer. Revenues from the
production of oil and gas from properties in which we have an interest with
other companies are recorded on the basis of sales to customers. Differences
between these sales and our share of production are not significant.

  INVENTORIES

     Inventories include international oil produced but not sold. Crude oil from
our operations located offshore Australia is produced into two floating
production, storage and off-loading vessels (FPSOs) and sold periodically as a
barge quantity is accumulated. The product inventory at December 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2001 consisted of approximately 138,541 and 170,471 barrels of
crude oil, respectively, valued at $2.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively,
and is carried at the lower of average cost or market. Also included in
inventories are materials and supplies, which also are stated at the lower of
average cost or market.

  FOREIGN CURRENCY

     The functional currency for Australia is the Australian dollar; the
functional currency for the United Kingdom is the British pound. The functional
currency for all other foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. Translation
adjustments resulting from translating our Australian subsidiary's Australian
dollar financial statements and our United Kingdom subsidiary's British pound
financial statements into U.S. dollars are included as other comprehensive
income in the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses
incurred on currency transactions in other than a country's functional currency
are included in the consolidated statement of income.

  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when acquired. We invest cash in excess of operating requirements
in U.S. Treasury Notes, Eurodollar bonds and investment grade commercial paper.
Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value.

     We have included fair value information in these notes when the fair value
of our financial instruments is different from the book value. Due to the short
maturity of our financial instruments classified as current assets and
liabilities, the book value approximates fair value.

     On January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."
See Note 5, "Commodity Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." For all
years prior to 2001, we accounted for our hedging activities in accordance with
SFAS No. 80. Gains and losses on our commodity derivative contracts were
recognized in revenue in the period in which the underlying production was
delivered. Unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivative contracts
were not recognized on our balance sheet under SFAS No. 80.

  OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES

     We use the full cost method of accounting. Under this method, all costs
incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
properties are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a
country-by-country basis. Such capitalized costs and estimated future
development and dismantlement costs are amortized on a unit-of-production method
based on proved reserves. For each cost center, the net capitalized costs of oil
and gas properties are limited to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost
center ceiling, defined as the sum of the present value (10% per annum discount
rate) of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, based on end of
period oil and gas prices as adjusted for the effects of hedging; plus the cost
of properties not being amortized, if any; plus the lower of cost or estimated
fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, if any;
less related income tax effects.

                                        53
<PAGE>
                          NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Application of full cost accounting rules did not result in a ceiling test
writedown in 2002. However, we did record a domestic ceiling test writedown of
$106 million ($68 million after-tax) at December 31, 2001. This impairment was
primarily the result of lower commodity prices at year-end 2001. Based on an
interim interpretation from the SEC that is applicable to all companies that use
the full cost method of accounting, the full cost ceiling test impairment
calculations took into account the effects of hedging. This interim
interpretation, which is subject to further consideration by the SEC before it
is finalized, requires that certain conditions be met in order to take into
account the effects of hedging in the calculation of full cost ceiling test
impairment, including that the hedges qualify under SFAS No. 133 and are
documented and designated as such and that the policy be applied on a consistent
basis whether or not the hedged price is higher than the current market price.
The writedown would have been $184 million ($118 million after-tax) if we had
not used hedge adjusted prices. Additionally, we recorded a charge of $0.5
million in 2000 related to abandoned prospect costs in foreign locations other
than Australia and China.

     Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce the
costs in the cost center unless the sale involves a significant quantity of
reserves in relation to the cost center, in which case a gain or loss is
recognized.

  FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT

     Furniture, fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives, which range between three and seven years,
using the straight-line method. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, furniture,
fixtures and equipment of $17.2 million and $12.6 million, respectively, is net
of accumulated depreciation of $9.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively.

  ABANDONMENT AND DISMANTLEMENT COSTS

     Future abandonment and dismantlement costs include costs to dismantle and
relocate or dispose of our offshore production platforms, FPSOs, gathering
systems, wells and related structures. We develop estimates of our future
abandonment and dismantlement costs for each of our properties based upon the
type of production structure, depth of water, currently available abandonment
procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Such
estimates are re-evaluated at least annually by our engineers.

     Total estimated future abandonment and dismantlement costs associated with
our properties were $127.7 million, $125.6 million and $120.4 million as of
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Estimated future abandonment and dismantlement costs are accrued on a
unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. Our accounting for these
costs changed effective January 1, 2003, see "New Accounting Standards" below.
The portion of future abandonment and dismantlement costs that has been accrued
is included in accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and was
$79.7 million, $68.4 million and $56.9 million as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

  INCOME TAXES

     We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax
regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
reported amounts in the financial statements.

     A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is
more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.

  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     We account for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     If the fair value based method of accounting under SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," had been applied, our net income and
earnings per common share for 2002, 2001 and 2000 would have approximated the
pro forma amounts below:

  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

     We operate a substantial portion of our oil and gas properties. As the
operator of a property, we make full payment for costs associated with the
property and seek reimbursement from the other working interest owners in the
property for their share of those costs. Our joint interest partners consist
primarily of independent oil and gas producers. If the oil and gas exploration
and production industry in general was adversely affected, the ability of our
joint interest partners to reimburse us could be adversely affected.

     Our oil and gas production purchasers consist primarily of independent
marketers, major oil and gas companies and gas pipeline companies. We perform
credit evaluations of, and monitor on a ongoing basis, the financial condition
of the purchasers of our production. Based on our evaluation, we obtain cash
escrows, letters of credit and parental guarantees from selected purchasers.
Over the past several years, we have sold a substantial portion of our oil and
gas production to two purchasers (see " -- Major Customers" below). The
remaining portion of our production is sold to a number of major oil and gas
companies and smaller marketing companies. We have not experienced any
significant losses from uncollectible accounts.

     All of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the
over-the-counter market. The use of hedging transactions involves the risk that
the counterparties may be unable to meet the financial terms of these
transactions. The counterparties for all of our hedging transactions have an
"investment grade" credit rating. We monitor on an ongoing basis the credit
ratings of our hedging counterparties. At December 31, 2002, Bank of Montreal,
Morgan Stanley and J Aron & Company were the counterparties with respect to 61%
of our hedged future production.

  MAJOR CUSTOMERS

     We sold oil and gas production representing more than 10% of our revenues
before the effects of hedging for the year ended December 31, 2002 to Superior
Natural Gas Corporation (25%) and ConocoPhillips Inc. (23%); for the year ended
December 31, 2001 to Conoco Inc. (28%) and Superior Natural Gas Corporation
(25%); and for the year ended December 31, 2000 to Conoco Inc. (35%) and
Superior Natural Gas Corporation (16%). Because alternative purchasers of oil
and gas are readily available, we believe that the loss of either or both of
these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on us.

  ACCOUNTING CHANGES

     We adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," as amended by SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
133, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," and SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 133," on January 1, 2001. In accordance with the transition
provisions of SFAS No. 133, on January 1, 2001, we recorded a cumulative effect
adjustment loss of $74.2 million (net of tax of $40.0 million) in accumulated
other comprehensive loss and a loss of $4.8 million (net of tax of $2.6 million)
in 2001 earnings. In addition, the adoption resulted in the recognition of $17.7
million of derivative assets and $139.3 million of derivative liabilities on the
balance sheet on January 1, 2001.

     On January 1, 2002, we began assessing hedge effectiveness based on the
total changes in cash flows on our collar and floor contracts as described by
the Derivative Implementation Group (DIG) Issue G20, "Cash Flow Hedges:
Assessing and Measuring the Effectiveness of a Purchased Option Used in a Cash
Flow Hedge." Accordingly, we have elected to prospectively record subsequent
changes in the fair value of our collar and floor contracts, including changes
associated with time value, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Gains or losses on these collar and floor contracts will be reclassified out of
other comprehensive income (loss) and into earnings when the forecasted sale of
production occurs. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded $29.1
million of expense under the income statement caption "Unrealized commodity
derivative income (expense)." This expense is associated with the settlement of
collar and floor contracts during the twelve-month period ended December 31,
2002 and primarily reflects the reversal of time value gains of approximately
$24.7 million recognized in earnings in 2001, prior to the adoption of DIG Issue
G20. Had we applied DIG Issue G20 from the January 1, 2001 adoption date of SFAS
133, our income statement caption "Unrealized commodity derivative income
(expense)" would have only reflected $0.5 million and $0.2 million of expense in
2002 and 2001, respectively, representing the ineffective portion of our hedges.
As a result, net income would have increased by $18.6 million in 2002 and
decreased by $16.3 million in 2001.

     We adopted SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements," effective January 1, 2000. The adoption of
SAB No. 101 requires us to report crude oil inventory associated with our
Australian offshore operations at the lower of cost or market, which was a
change from our historical policy of recording such inventory at market value on
the balance sheet date, net of estimated costs to sell. The cumulative effect of
the change from the acquisition date of our Australian operations in July 1999
through December 31, 1999 was a reduction in net income of $2.36 million, (net
of tax of $1.3 million) or $0.05 per diluted share, and is shown as the
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2000.

  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     In 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations". This statement changes the method of accounting for costs
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets (e.g. oil and gas production
facilities, etc.) that we are obligated to incur. The statement requires that
the fair value of the obligation be recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the asset
retirement cost be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the associated
asset. Under our previous accounting method, we recognized the cost to abandon
our oil and gas properties over their productive lives on a unit-of-production
basis.

     We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003. A pre-tax cumulative
effect gain of approximately $8 million will be reported in our consolidated
statement of income on January 1, 2003. We will also report an increase in our
assets of approximately $160 million and an increase in our liabilities of
approximately $152 million. There will be no impact on our reported cash flows
as a result of adopting SFAS No. 143.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     In the second quarter of 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Recision of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections as of April 2002." This statement provides guidance for
income statement classifications of gains and losses on extinguishment of debt
and accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that
are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. Our adoption of SFAS No. 145 on
January 1, 2003 had no effect on our financial statements.

     In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS No. 146 requires
that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred and establishes that fair value is the
objective for initial measurement of the liability. The provisions of SFAS No.
146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002. Our adoption of SFAS 146 on January 1, 2003 had no effect on
our financial statements.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123."
SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of accounting for entities that elect
to transition from the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation to the fair value method. In addition, this statement amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosures in both annual
and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. We adopted
the disclosure provisions of this statement in our year-end 2002 financial
statements. We continue to apply the intrinsic value method of accounting for
our stock-based compensation plans.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be
recorded at fair value, which is different from the current practice of
recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, as
those terms are defined in SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." FIN 45
has a dual effective date. The initial recognition and measurement provisions
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements in the interpretation are
effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after
December 15, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 45 to have a material
effect on our financial statements. See Note 7, "Debt -- Gas Sales Obligation,"
regarding the guarantee by one of our subsidiaries associated with the Gas Sales
Obligation.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, "Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51." The primary objectives of FIN
46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control
is achieved through means other than through voting rights (these entities are
referred to as "variable interest entities" or "VIEs") and how to determine if a
business enterprise should consolidate the VIE. This new model for consolidation
applies to an entity for which either (1) the equity investors (if any) do not
have a controlling financial interest or (2) the equity investment at risk is
insufficient to finance that entity's activities without receiving additional
subordinated financial support from other parties. In addition, FIN 46 requires
that all enterprises with a significant variable interest in a VIE make
additional disclosures regarding their relationship with the VIE. We are
currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 on our financial statements; however
we do not believe that we have any VIEs that will require consolidation in our
financial statements under this interpretation.

2.  EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Basic earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income
(the numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period (the denominator). Diluted EPS is

similarly calculated using the treasury stock method except that the denominator
is increased to reflect the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding
stock options and convertible securities were exercised for or converted into
common stock. See Note 9, "Convertible Preferred Securities of Newfield
Financial Trust I" and Note 13, "Stock-Based Compensation -- Stock Options."

3.  ACQUISITIONS:

     On November 26, 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
EEX Corporation and EEX became a wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield Exploration
Company. We acquired EEX primarily to further our efforts to expand our onshore
operations. The EEX properties are very complementary to our previously existing
South Texas property base. The acquisition also accelerated our expansion into
deepwater.

     The unaudited pro forma results also give effect to our January 23, 2001
acquisition of Lariat Petroleum, Inc. as if the acquisition had occurred on
January 1, 2001. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately
$333 million, inclusive of the assumption of debt and certain other obligations
of Lariat. The consideration included the issuance of approximately 1.9 million
shares of our common stock

million to oil and gas properties, which included a $105 million step-up
associated with deferred income taxes.

We believe that substantially all of the costs not currently subject to
amortization will be evaluated within four years.

  ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

     In connection with the EEX acquisition, we obtained a 60% interest in a
floating production system (FPS) and pipelines. The FPS is a combination
deepwater drilling rig and processing facility capable of simultaneous drilling
and production operations. In addition to the FPS and pipelines, we also
obtained a 60% interest in a processing facility located at the end of the
pipelines in shallow water.

     Because these infrastructure assets are not currently in service and we do
not have a specific use for them in our offshore operations, in late 2002 we set
about actively marketing them for sale. Based on our assessment of the market
for these assets in a third party sale, we estimated their fair value to be $35
million at the acquisition date and at December 31, 2002. However, as there is
no established third party market for these unique assets, it is difficult to
accurately estimate what a sale would bring. An immediate sale or a sale under
distressed circumstances might realize less than the current carrying value of
the assets. The costs associated with maintaining these assets are included as
an operating expense in our consolidated income statement. Such costs were not
significant in 2002.

5.  COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:

     We maintain a commodity-price risk management strategy that utilizes
derivative instruments, primarily swaps, collars and floor contracts, in order
to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted
sale of our oil and gas production. While the use of these derivative
instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also
limit future revenues from favorable price movements.

     With respect to any particular swap transaction, the counterparty is
required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement
period is less than the swap price for such transaction, and we are required to
make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement
period is greater than the swap price for such transaction. For any particular
collar transaction, the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the
settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for such
transaction, and we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the
settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price of such
transaction. For any particular floor contract, the counterparty is required to
make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below
the floor price for such transaction. We are not required to make any payment in
connection with the settlement of a floor contract.

     As of January 1, 2001, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet
at their fair value. Substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled
based upon reported settlement prices on the NYMEX. The estimated fair value of
these transactions is based upon various factors that include closing exchange
prices on the NYMEX, over-the-counter quotations, volatility and the time value
of options. The calculation of the fair value of collars and floors requires the
use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. On the date that we enter into a
derivative contract, we designate the derivative as a hedge of the variability
in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our oil or gas production.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is
designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is
effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the sale of
the hedged oil or gas production. Gains or losses on our hedging transactions
are reported in oil and gas revenues on the consolidated statement of income.

     We expect that within the next twelve months we will reclassify to earnings
$33.2 million in after tax losses out of the net $27.3 million in after tax
losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2002.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Any hedge ineffectiveness (which represents the amount by which the change
in the fair value of the derivative differs from the change in the cash flows of
the forecasted sale of production) is recorded in current-period earnings. On
January 1, 2002, we began assessing hedge effectiveness based on the total
changes in cash flows on our collar and floor contracts as described by DIG
Issue G20, "Cash Flow Hedges: Assessing and Measuring the Effectiveness of a
Purchased Option Used in a Cash Flow Hedge." Accordingly, we have elected to
prospectively record subsequent changes in the fair value, including changes
associated with time value, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Gains or losses on these collar and floor contracts will be reclassified out of
other comprehensive income (loss) and into earnings when the forecasted sale of
production occurs. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded expense of
$29.1 million under the income statement caption "Unrealized commodity
derivative income (expense)." This expense is associated with the settlement of
collar and floor contracts during the twelve-month period ended December 31,
2002 and primarily reflects the reversal of time value gains previously
recognized in earnings during 2001, prior to the adoption of DIG Issue G20.

     We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all
derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to the specific forecasted
sale of oil or gas at its physical location. We also formally assess (both at
the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives that are
used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in
the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to
remain highly effective in future periods. If it is determined that a derivative
is not (or has ceased to be) highly effective as a hedge, we will discontinue
hedge accounting prospectively. The gain or loss on the derivative will remain
in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and will be reclassified into
earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If hedge accounting
is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we will carry the
derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing all subsequent
changes in the fair value in current-period earnings. Hedge accounting was not
discontinued during the periods presented for any hedging instruments.

(1) Our capacity under our credit facility is available to repay current amounts
    due under the gas sales obligation and our money market lines of credit and,
    therefore, these obligations have been classified as long-term.

  CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

     At December 31, 2002, we maintained our reserve-based revolving credit
facility with Chase Manhattan Bank, as agent. The banks participating in the
facility have committed to lend us up to $425 million. The amount available
under the facility is subject to a calculated borrowing base determined by banks
holding 75%

                                        64

of the aggregate commitments. The borrowing base is reduced by the principal
amount of any outstanding senior notes ($300 million at December 31, 2002), 30%
of the principal amount of any outstanding senior subordinated notes ($250
million at December 31, 2002), the outstanding principal amount of the secured
notes ($77 million at December 31, 2002) and an agreed valuation for the gas
sales obligation ($60 million at December 31, 2002). The borrowing base will be
redetermined at least semi-annually and, after reduction for the foregoing
items, was $218 million at December 31, 2002 and $210 million at December 31,
2001. No assurances can be given that the banks will not elect to redetermine
the borrowing base in the future. The facility contains restrictions on the
payment of dividends and the incurrence of debt as well as other customary
covenants and restrictions. The facility matures on January 23, 2004.

     We also have money market lines of credit with various banks in an amount
limited by the revolving credit facility to $40 million. At December 31, 2002,
we had approximately $222 million of available capacity under our credit
arrangements.

     At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the interest rate was 2.737% and 3.25%,
respectively, for LIBOR based loans under our credit facility and 2.615% and
3.00%, respectively, for the loans outstanding under our money market lines of
credit. Borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and money market lines
of credit are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value.

     Our current and previous credit facilities provide or provided for the
payment of a commitment fee and a standby fee. We paid fees of approximately
$447,000, $397,000 and $315,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

  SENIOR NOTES

     On February 22, 2001, we issued $175 million aggregate principal amount of
our 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011 priced (at 99.931% of par) with a yield to
maturity of 7.635%. Net proceeds from the offering of $173.1 million were used
to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility incurred
in connection with our January 2001 acquisition of Lariat Petroleum. Interest is
payable on each March 1 and September 1, commencing September 1, 2001.

     The estimated fair market value of our 7.45% Senior Notes due 2007, based
on quoted market prices at December 31, 2002 and 2001, was $130.1 million and
$126.3 million, respectively. The estimated fair market value of our 7 5/8%
Senior Notes due 2011, based on quoted market prices at December 31, 2002 and
2001, was $183.6 million and $173.0 million, respectively.

     Our senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank
equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations. We may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before
their maturity at a redemption price based on a make-whole amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indentures governing our
senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things
incur debt secured by certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and
enter into merger or consolidation transactions. The indentures also provide
that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in
the future, then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably
guaranteed by that subsidiary.

  SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES

     On August 13, 2002, we sold $250 million principal amount of our 8 3/8%
Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 priced with a yield to maturity of 8.50%. The
net proceeds from the offering of approximately $241.8 million were used to
repay EEX debt that became due at the closing of the EEX acquisition and to pay
transaction costs. Interest accruing prior to the closing of the EEX acquisition
was capitalized as a cost of the transaction. The estimated fair market value of
the 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012, based on quoted market prices at
December 31, 2002, was $245.0 million.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in
right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness. We may
redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after August 15, 2007 at a
redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes. Prior to August
15, 2007, we may redeem all but not part of the notes at a redemption price
based on a make-whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
redemption. In addition, before August 15, 2005, we may redeem up to 35% of the
original principal amount of the notes with the net cash proceeds of certain
sales of our common stock at 108.375% of the principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The indenture governing the notes
limits our ability to incur additional debt, make restricted payments, pay
dividends on or redeem our capital stock, make certain investments, create
liens, make certain dispositions of assets, engage in transactions with
affiliates and engage in mergers, consolidations and certain sales of assets.

  SECURED NOTES

     In the second quarter of 2001, EEX assumed the obligations under the
secured notes in connection with the termination of two leveraged leasing
arrangements. The notes accrue interest at a rate of 7.54% per year and are
secured by the floating production system and pipelines described in Note 4,
"Oil and Gas Assets -- Assets Held for Sale." Redemption of the notes prior to
2006 may require us to pay make-whole premiums. Principal is payable in annual
installments on January 2 of each year (except 2006) with the final installment
due in 2009.

December 31, 2002 (in thousands):

  GAS SALES OBLIGATION

     In 1999, EEX entered into a gas forward sales contract with Bob West
Treasure L.L.C. (BWT), an affiliate of Enron Corporation. Pursuant to the gas
sales contract, EEX committed to deliver approximately 50 Bcfe of production to
BWT in exchange for proceeds of $105 million. BWT receives an adjusted market
price as the volumes are delivered. EEX also has an obligation to market the
delivered volumes of gas for BWT. Under the terms of the gas sales contract, EEX
is required to make a cash payment if the committed gas volumes are not
delivered. Additionally, BWT holds liens on certain of EEX's oil and gas
properties as security if the committed gas volumes are not delivered or the
cash payments are not made.

     As of the date of our acquisition of EEX, we recorded a liability of
approximately $62 million, which represented the current market value of the
approximate 16 Bcfe of reserves remaining under the gas sales

                                        66
<PAGE>
                          NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

contract. We have accounted for the obligations under the gas sales contract as
debt in our consolidated balance sheet because:

     - the transaction is cancellable by EEX prior to maturity via a lump sum
       payment;

     - BWT has recourse against EEX if the committed volumes are not delivered;
       and

     - EEX has significant continuing involvement via their obligation to
       produce the subject reserves and market them on behalf of BWT.

     Payments under the gas sales contract are amortized as the underlying gas
is delivered under the interest method using an interest rate of 9.5%. As of
December 31, 2002, the unamortized balance was approximately $60 million and the
fair value of the remaining obligation was approximately $64.5 million. The
interest portion of the payment is included as a component of interest expense
in our consolidated income statement.

     EEX also guaranteed BWT's performance under certain swap agreements between
BWT and Enron entered into concurrently with the gas sales contract. If BWT
fails to make payments under the swap agreements, EEX must perform under the
guarantee by paying Enron on BWT's behalf. The maximum amount that EEX could be
required to pay under this guarantee is not determinable and would depend on the
settlement value of the swaps at the time of any BWT default. BWT, which is
outside of the Enron bankruptcy proceedings, continues to meet its contractual
obligations under its swap agreements and, therefore, EEX has not been required
to perform under this guarantee.

8.  MINORITY INTEREST:

     In conjunction with EEX entering into the gas sales obligation (see Note 7,
"Debt -- Gas Sales Obligation"), BWT acquired a limited membership interest in
an EEX subsidiary that owns a substantial portion of EEX's consolidated
reserves, a portion of which are subject to the gas sales obligation. We have
reported this limited membership interest as a "minority" interest on our
consolidated balance sheet based on our estimated price to re-acquire the
interest. BWT's limited membership interest is not allocated any earnings and is
not entitled to cash distributions.

9.  CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF NEWFIELD FINANCIAL TRUST I:

     In August 1999, Newfield Financial Trust I, a Delaware business trust and a
100% owned, finance subsidiary (in each case, as defined in Rule 3-10 of
Regulation S-X) of Newfield Exploration Company, issued, in an underwritten
public offering, $143.75 million (2.875 million securities having a liquidation
preference of $50 each) of 6.5% Cumulative Quarterly Income Convertible
Preferred Securities, Series A. The proceeds from the issuance of these
securities (commonly referred to as trust preferred securities) were used to
purchase $143.75 million of Newfield Exploration Company's 6.5% Junior
Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2029. The interest terms and payment
dates of the debentures correspond to the distribution terms of the trust
preferred securities. Newfield Exploration Company's obligations under the
debentures and related agreements, when taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee of payments due on the trust preferred securities. The
sole asset of the trust is the debentures. The trust has no independent
operations. The debentures are eliminated in our consolidated financial
statements.

     The trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly in
arrears at a rate of 6.5% per annum on the stated liquidation amount of $50 per
trust preferred security on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of
each year to holders of record 15 business days immediately prior to the
distribution payment date. We may, on one or more occasions, defer the payment
of interest on the debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods unless
an event of default on the debentures has occurred and is continuing. During any
deferral period, the trust will defer the payment of distributions, but accrued
distributions on the trust preferred securities will compound quarterly and we
will generally not be permitted to declare or pay any

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

dividends or distributions on, or redeem or acquire, any of our capital stock or
make any payment of principal or interest on any debt securities that rank equal
or junior to the debentures.

     The trust preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holder
at any time into our common stock at the rate of 1.3646 shares of our common
stock per trust preferred security. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment
for certain dilutive events and is currently equivalent to a conversion price of
$36.64 per share of our common stock. The trust preferred securities are
mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the debentures on August 15, 2029, and
on a proportionate basis to the extent of any earlier redemption of any
debentures by us. The debentures are redeemable by us at any time.

     The estimated fair market value of the trust preferred securities at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, based on quoted market prices, was $159.0 million
and $155.3 million, respectively.

10.  NEWFIELD FINANCIAL TRUST II:

     Pursuant to a Form S-3 registration statement filed with the SEC under the
Securities Act of 1933, Newfield Financial Trust II, a 100% owned, finance
subsidiary (in each case, as defined in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X) of Newfield
Exploration Company, may offer and sell its preferred securities to the public.
If issued and sold, the holders of the trust preferred securities would be
entitled to receive periodic payments that are cumulative if unpaid, would be
entitled to receive a fixed liquidation amount and the backup undertakings would
provide a bundle of rights that together place the holder in the same position
as if Newfield Exploration Company had fully and unconditionally guaranteed the
trust's payment obligations on its trust preferred securities. To date, no
preferred securities of the trust have been issued.

11. INCOME TAXES:

     Income before income taxes consists of the following:

1) We realized a one-time tax benefit resulting from a change in Australian tax
   law enacted in 2002 enabling us to file our tax return on a consolidated
   basis. As a result, we realized the benefit of certain tax losses previously
   stranded in certain of our Australian subsidiaries.

2) We reduced the valuation allowance on our Australian net operating loss
   carryforward in 2000 primarily as a result of a substantial increase in
   estimated taxable income in Australia.

The components of the deferred tax asset and the deferred tax liability are as

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     As of December 31, 2002, we had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of approximately $231.6 million that may be used in
future years to offset taxable income. Utilization of the NOL carryforwards is
subject to annual limitations due to certain stock ownership changes. To the
extent not utilized, the NOL carryforwards will begin to expire during the years
2003 through 2022 with a majority expiring in 2019 through 2022.

     U.S. deferred taxes have not been provided on foreign income of $44.2
million that is permanently reinvested internationally. We currently do not have
any foreign tax credits available to reduce U.S. taxes on this income if it was
repatriated.

12.  TREASURY STOCK:

     In May 2001, our Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up to $50
million to repurchase shares of our common stock. We repurchased 823,000 shares
in late 2001 for total consideration of $24.7 million at an average of $29.97
per share. In February 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the expenditure
of up to $50 million from that date forward to repurchase shares of our common
stock. No limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program. Subject to
applicable securities laws, we may purchase stock at times and in amounts that
we deem appropriate. We also repurchase stock in conjunction with our
stock-based compensation plans. Such repurchases have not been significant.

13.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:

     We have several stock-based compensation plans, which are described below.
We apply the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for our stock-based compensation plans.

     Options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant and become
exercisable at the rate of 20% per year. If additional options are granted under
our existing plans, the exercise price will not be less than the fair market
value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.

     The weighted average fair value of an option to purchase one share of
common stock granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $14.74, $16.08 and $15.41,
respectively. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated as of the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions.

</Table>

     Common stock issued through the exercise of non-qualified stock options
results in a tax deduction for us equivalent to the compensation income
recognized by the option holder. For financial reporting purposes, the tax
effect of this deduction is accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in
capital rather than as a reduction of income tax expense. The exercise of stock
options during 2002, 2001 and 2000 resulted in a tax benefit to us of
approximately $2.5 million, $2.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively.

     At December 31, 2002, we had approximately 1,931,000 additional shares
available for issuance pursuant to the existing plans. As discussed below, our
omnibus stock plans also provide for the issuance of restricted shares. Any such
issuance would reduce the number of shares available for stock option grants. Of
the additional shares available at December 31, 2002, only 305,089 may be
granted as restricted shares.

  RESTRICTED SHARES

     At December 31, 2002, there were 176,000 shares of our common stock
outstanding that remain subject to forfeiture. These restricted shares fully
vest on the ninth anniversary of the date of grant, but vesting may be
accelerated if certain performance criteria are met. For a discussion of the
number of shares of common stock available for grant as restricted shares,
please see the immediately preceding paragraph.

     Under our non-employee director restricted stock plan, immediately after
each annual meeting of our stockholders each of our directors then in office who
has not been an employee of our company at any time since the beginning of the
calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the annual meeting is held
receives a number of restricted shares determined by dividing $30,000 by the
fair market value on the date of the annual meeting. The forfeiture restrictions
lapse on the day before the first annual meeting of stockholders following the
date of issuance of the shares if the holder remains a director until that time.
At December 31, 2002, 31,086 shares remain available for grants under this plan.

     In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, we recognize unearned compensation
in connection with the grant of restricted shares equal to the fair value of the
shares on the date of grant. As the restricted shares vest, we reduce unearned
compensation and recognize compensation expense. The table below sets forth

  EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

     Pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, for each six month period
beginning on January 1 or July 1 during the term of the plan, each eligible
employee has the opportunity to purchase our common stock for a purchase price
equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on the
first day of the period or the last day of the period. No employee may purchase
common stock under the plan valued at more than $25,000 in any calendar year.
Employees of our Australian and United Kingdom subsidiaries are not eligible to
participate.

     At December 31, 2002, 141,649 shares of common stock were available for
issuance pursuant to our stock purchase plan. Under the plan, we sold 29,410
shares in 2002 at a weighted average price of $30.27; 28,941 shares in 2001 at a
weighted average price of $27.16; and 22,180 shares in 2000 at a weighted
average price of $26.75. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations, we have not recognized any compensation expense with respect to
the plan.

     The weighted average fair value of the option to purchase stock during 2002
was $9.85; during 2001 was $9.86; and during 2000 was $8.87. The fair value of
each option granted under the stock purchase plan is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000:

14.  PENSION PLAN OBLIGATION:

     Prior to our acquisition of EEX, EEX established and maintained a defined
benefit pension plan. Only a few EEX employees who have continued their
employment with us are eligible for further accrual of benefits under this plan.
Accrued retirement costs are funded based upon applicable requirements of
federal law and deductibility for federal income tax purposes.

15.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

  INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

     With respect to calendar years ended prior to January 1, 2003, we granted
incentive compensation awards to our employees pursuant to our 1993 incentive
compensation plan. The incentive plan provided for the creation each calendar
year of an award pool that, in general, equalled the revenues that would be
attributable to a 1% overriding royalty interest on acquired producing
properties and a 2% overriding royalty interest on exploration properties,
bearing on both our interest and the interests of certain investors that
participated in our activities in such properties. If, for a particular year,
the portion of the pool that related to our interests was in excess of 5% of our
adjusted net income (as defined in the plan) for that year, such excess could
not be awarded to employees. The incentive plan is administered by the
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors with award amounts recommended
by our chief executive officer. All employees were eligible for awards if
employed on both October 1 and December 31 of the performance period. Awards
could (and generally did) have both a current and a deferred component. Eligible
employees could elect for all or a portion of deferred awards to be paid in our
common stock instead of cash. In such case, the number of shares of common stock
to be awarded was determined by using the fair market value of our common stock
on the date of the award. Deferred awards are paid in four annual installments,
each installment consisting of 25% of the deferred award, plus interest on
awards paid in cash. Total expense under the incentive plan for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $10.1 million, $11.6 million and $12.8
million, respectively.

  401(K) PLAN

     We sponsor a 401(k) profit sharing plan under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers all of our employees other than
employees of our Australian and United Kingdom subsidiaries. We match $1.00 for
each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of an
employee's salary, subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service. Our contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled $1.5 million, $1.3 million
and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

  DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

     During 1997, we implemented a highly compensated employee deferred
compensation plan. This non-qualified plan allows an eligible employee to defer
a portion of the employee's salary or bonus on an annual basis. We match $1.00
for each $1.00 of employee deferral, with our contribution not to exceed 8% of
an employee's salary, subject to limitations imposed by the plan. Our
contribution with respect to each participant in the deferred compensation plan
is reduced by the amount of contribution made by us to our 401(k) plan for that
participant. Our contributions to the deferred compensation plan totaled $32,000
in 2002, $32,000 in 2001 and $29,000 in 2000.

  POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN

     We also sponsor a post-retirement medical plan that covers retired
employees until they attain the age of 65. Our accrued benefit obligation under
this plan was approximately $2.2 million at December 31, 2002. For measurement
purposes, we assumed a discount rate of 6.5% and an 11% annual rate of increase
in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The rate of increase in
cost of benefits is assumed to gradually decrease to a 5% ultimate rate by 2008.
Our periodic benefit cost for this plan is not significant.

16.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

  LEASE COMMITMENTS

     We have entered into non-cancellable operating leases for office space in
Houston and San Antonio, Texas, Tulsa, Oklahoma and Perth, Australia. Rent
expense for office space for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
was $4.8 million, $4.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Future minimum
payments required under our office and other material leases as of December 31,
2002 are as follows (in thousands):

  LITIGATION

     We have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits arising in the
ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be
predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

17.  STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN:

     In 1999, we adopted a stockholder rights plan. The plan is designed to
ensure that all of our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment if a
takeover of our company is proposed. It includes safeguards against partial or
two-tiered tender offers, squeeze-out mergers and other abusive takeover
tactics.

     The plan provides for the issuance of one right for each outstanding share
of our common stock. The rights will become exercisable only if a person or
group acquires 20% or more of our outstanding voting stock or announces a tender
or exchange offer that would result in ownership of 20% or more of our voting
stock.

     Each right will entitle the holder to buy one one-thousandth ( 1/1000) of a
share of a new series of junior participating preferred stock at an exercise
price of $85 per right, subject to antidilution adjustments. Each one
one-thousandth of a share of this new preferred stock has the dividend and
voting rights of, and is designed to be substantially equivalent to, one share
of our common stock. Our Board of Directors may, at its option, redeem all
rights for $0.01 per right at any time prior to the acquisition of 20% or more
of our outstanding voting stock by a person or group.

     If a person or group acquires 20% or more of our outstanding voting stock,
each right will entitle holders, other than the acquiring party, to purchase
shares of our common stock having a market value of $170 for a purchase price of
$85, subject to antidilution adjustments.

     The plan also includes an exchange option. If a person or group acquires
20% or more, but less than 50% of our outstanding voting stock, our Board of
Directors may, at its option, exchange the rights in whole or part for shares of
our common stock. Under this option, we would issue one share of our common
stock, or one one-thousandth of a share of new preferred stock, for each two
shares of our common stock for which a right is then exercisable. This exchange
would not apply to rights held by the person or group holding 20% or more of our
voting stock.

<PAGE>
                          NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     If, after the rights have become exercisable, we merge or otherwise combine
with another entity, or sell assets constituting more than 50% of our assets or
producing more than 50% of our earning power or cash flow, each right then
outstanding will entitle its holder to purchase for $85, subject to antidilution
adjustments, a number of the acquiring party's common shares having a market
value of twice that amount.

     The plan will not prevent, nor is it intended to prevent, a takeover of our
company. Since the rights may be redeemed by our Board of Directors under
certain circumstances, they should not interfere with any merger or other
business combination approved by our Board. The issuance of the rights does not
in any way diminish our financial strength or interfere with our business plans.
The issuance of the rights has no dilutive effect, does not affect reported
earnings per share or change the way our common stock is currently traded.

20.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

     Prior to our acquisition of Lariat Petroleum in January 2001, Warburg,
Pincus Ventures, L.P. (WPV) owned approximately 88% of the outstanding capital
stock of Lariat on a fully diluted basis. WPV received cash proceeds for its
stock of approximately $78.6 million and 1,864,735 shares of our common stock in
the acquisition. WPV also received approximately $39.1 million as repayment in
full of notes payable by Lariat to WPV. In connection with the acquisition, we
entered into a registration rights agreement with the former stockholders of
Lariat that received our common stock in the acquisition, including WPV.
Pursuant this agreement, we filed a shelf registration statement under the
Securities Act to register the reoffer and resale of these shares of common
stock. We are required to maintain the effectiveness of the registration
statement for the shorter of two years and the date upon which all of the shares
covered by the registration statement have been sold. In addition, we agreed to
provide customary indemnification and contribution for the benefit of the other
parties to the registration rights agreement, including WPV.

     The sole general partner of WPV is Warburg, Pincus & Co. (WP & Co.).
Warburg Pincus LLC (WP LLC) manages WPV. Howard H. Newman, one of our directors,
is a general partner of WP & Co and a Vice Chairman, Managing Director and
member of WP LLC.

     Three private equity funds (the WP funds) managed by WP LLC held all of the
outstanding preferred stock of EEX prior to our acquisition of EEX and received
an aggregate of 4,700,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for their EEX
preferred stock in the acquisition. Concurrently with the execution of the
merger agreement to acquire EEX, we entered into a registration rights agreement
and a voting agreement with the WP funds. Pursuant to the registration rights
agreement, we filed a shelf registration statement under the Securities Act to
register the reoffer and resale of the shares of our common stock received by
the WP funds in the acquisition. We are required to maintain the effectiveness
of the registration statement until all of the shares of our common stock
received by the WP funds in the acquisition have been sold or until such time as
such shares are eligible for resale under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act.
In addition, if we propose to file a registration statement or a prospectus
supplement to an already effective shelf registration statement with respect to
an underwritten public offering of our common stock, the WP funds have the right
to include their shares of our commons stock in the registration, subject to
certain limitations. We also agreed to provide customary indemnification and
contribution for the benefit of the WP funds. Pursuant to the voting agreement,
we paid the WP funds $62,500, representing 50% of the filing fee paid by the WP
funds in connection with antitrust filings they made in connection with the
acquisition.

     WP & Co is the sole general partner of the WP funds and Mr. Newman was a
director of EEX prior to its acquisition.

     Terry Huffington, one of our directors, is a principal owner of Huffco
International L.L.C. and David A. Trice, our President and Chief Executive
Officer, is a minority owner of Huffco. In May 1997, prior to Ms. Huffington and
Mr. Trice becoming affiliated with us, we acquired from Huffco an entity now
known as Newfield China, LDC, the owner of a 35% interest (subject to a 51%
reversionary interest held by the Chinese government) in a production sharing
contract area, referred to as "Block 05/36," in the Bohai Bay, offshore China.
Huffco retained preferred shares of Newfield China that provide for an aggregate
dividend equal to 10% of the excess of proceeds received by Newfield China from
the sale of oil, gas and other minerals over all costs incurred with respect to
exploration and production in Block 05/36, plus the cash purchase price we paid
Huffco for Newfield China ($6.2 million). At December 31, 2002, Newfield China
had approximately $36 million in unrecovered costs, no reserves and no revenue
and, as a result, no dividends have been paid to date on its preferred shares.

21.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT:

     On March 6, 2003, we reached an agreement with BWT, certain lenders and
insurers of BWT and the unsecured creditors committee of Enron to terminate
EEX's gas forward sales contract. (See Note 7, "Debt -- Gas Sales Obligation").
The agreement, which is subject to the final approval of the Enron bankruptcy
court, provides for the termination of the gas sales contract, the swaps entered
into in connection with the gas sales contract and any other agreements between
EEX, BWT and Enron related to the gas sales contract, including the guarantee
and all liens and other security interests on EEX's properties, in exchange for
a payment to BWT representing:

     - the remaining unamortized obligation under the gas sales contract;

     - the fair market value of certain swaps entered into by BWT in conjunction
       with the gas sales contract;

     - an agreed upon value of $0.5 million for BWT's limited membership
       interest in an EEX subsidiary that BWT acquired in conjunction with the
       gas sales contract.

       SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES -- UNAUDITED -- (CONTINUED)

     Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating
quantities of "proved" and "proved developed" natural gas and crude oil reserves
is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of
all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The
data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result
of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving
production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production
under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions to existing
reserve estimates occur from time to time.

ESTIMATED NET QUANTITIES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

     The following table sets forth our net proved reserves, including the
changes therein, and proved developed reserves at the end of each year in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2002, as estimated by our petroleum
engineering staff:

       SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES -- UNAUDITED -- (CONTINUED)

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATING TO PROVED OIL
AND GAS RESERVES

     The following information was developed utilizing procedures prescribed by
SFAS No. 69, "Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities." The
information is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff.
It may be useful for certain comparative purposes, but should not be solely
relied upon in evaluating us or our performance. Further, information contained
in the following tables should not be considered as representative of realistic
assessments of future cash flows, nor should the "standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows" be viewed as representative of our current
value.

     We believe that in reviewing the information that follows the following
factors should be taken into account:

     - future costs and selling prices will probably differ from those required
       to be used in these calculations;

     - due to future market conditions and governmental regulations, actual
       rates of production achieved in future years may vary significantly from
       the rates of production assumed in the calculations;

     - a 10% discount rate may not be reasonable as a measure of the relative
       risk inherent in realizing future net oil and gas revenues; and

     - future net revenues may be subject to different rates of income taxation.

     Under the standardized measure, future cash inflows were estimated by
applying year-end oil and gas prices, adjusted for location and quality
differences, to the estimated future production of year-end proved reserves.
Future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future development, abandonment
and production costs based on year-end costs in order to arrive at net cash
flows before tax. Future income tax expense has been computed by applying
year-end statutory tax rates to aggregate future pre-tax net cash flows reduced
by the tax basis of the properties involved and tax carryforwards. Use of a 10%
discount rate and year-end prices and costs are required by SFAS 69.

     In general, management does not rely on the following information in making
investment and operating decisions. Such decisions are based upon a wide range
of factors, including estimates of probable as well as proved reserves and
varying price and cost assumptions considered more representative of a range of
possible economic conditions that may be anticipated.

contemplated to be taken by the Grantor Trustee on the Closing Date in the

         2.11 Nonwaiver Provision. Notwithstanding anything else set forth

or proposed change shall have occurred from October 23, 1996 to the Closing Date

<PAGE>

thereof), except for record title to the Undivided Interest, which will continue
to be held by Enserch Exploration, (b) the filings and recordings listed in
Schedule 3 will be all the filings and recordings necessary to establish the
Grantor Trustee's right, title and interest in and to the Undivided Interest, to

to affect (x) the consummation of the transactions under this Agreement, the
Pass Through Trust Agreement, the Reimbursement Agreement or any other Operative
Document to which it is a party or (y) the business, operations or properties of
the Lessee, its ability to perform its obligations under the Reimbursement
Agreement or any of the Operative Documents to which it is a party, or the
continued economic operation of the Production System. The Lessee is not in

default would materially and adversely affect the business, operations or
properties of the Lessee as it relates to the Production System, its ability to
perform its obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement or any of the
Operative Documents to which it is a party, or the continued economic operation
of the Production System or would result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien



                                       25
<PAGE>

(other than a Permitted Lien) upon the Production System or the Undivided

         Documents;

                  (b) there have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials at or
         from the Production System which have been required to be reported to
         any Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable Environmental

         adversely affect the Production System or the Lessee's ability to
         perform its obligations under the Operative Documents; and

                  (c) neither Enserch Holdings, the Lessee nor any of their
         respective Affiliates has received any written notice that such Person
         is subject to any threatened, pending or outstanding Claim relating to
         the Production System with respect to any Environmental Law or any
         Remedial Action, which if decided adversely to such Person, would in
         the aggregate materially adversely affect the Production System or the

margin stock or, to its knowledge, to extend credit to others for the purpose of

relating to leasing generally) having jurisdiction or regulatory authority over
(i) the production, processing, transportation or sale of oil or gas or (ii) the

the subject matter of the Operating Agreement or any Garden Banks Document.

currently existing which presently materially and adversely affects the
operation or maintenance of the Production System or which would materially and
adversely affect the capability of the Production System (A) to operate as an
oil and gas exploration facility or (B) materially impair the value, utility or
remaining useful life of the Production System from that determined in the Final

change in the financial condition of the Lessee and its Subsidiaries.

         5.24 Disclosure. No information or report furnished in writing to the
Participants contains any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading.

disclosed in writing to each of the Participants that materially adversely
affects the ability of the Lessee to perform its obligations under the Operating
Agreement, this Participation Agreement and the other Operative Documents to
which it is a party. The Lessee is not in default nor has any event or
circumstance occurred which, but for the expiration of any applicable grace

the Grantor Trustee pursuant to the Agency and Support Agreement, to the extent
such rights and interests are to be made available to the Grantor Trustee or its
permitted transferees, together with the rights to be made available under the
Operating Agreement, permit the Grantor Trustee or its permitted transferee to
use (as distinguished from possessing) the Production System (either directly or
through the exercise of rights under the Operating Agreement) on a



                                       29

remaining in the hands of Enserch Holdings after such conveyances is not
unreasonably small capital; the property remaining in the hands of the Lessee

necessary for the continued economic operation of the Production System and that
are not provided pursuant to the Agency and Support Agreement.

         5.31 Representations and Warranties of Head Lessor. The representations
and warranties of the Head Lessor contained in Section 11 of the Head Lease are
true and correct.

Grantor Trustee all right, title and interest Enserch Holdings has in the
Production System and every part thereof under all Governmental Rules; the Head

and Security Agreement, taken together with the Head Lease, are effective to
convey all rights and interests of Enserch Exploration, in accordance with the
terms thereof; and, assuming the filings contemplated by Section 5.7 are made,
such conveyance is effective against third parties.

                  (c) Enserch Exploration has the power to convey to the Grantor

is enforceable against all third parties.

         NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN OR IN ANY OTHER OPERATIVE
DOCUMENT, THE LESSEE DOES NOT MAKE NOR SHALL THE LESSEE BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE,
AND THE LESSEE HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY (OTHER THAN

which the Owner Participant is a party have been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Owner Participant and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof and thereof by the other parties hereto and
thereto, are, or on the Closing Date will be, legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Owner Participant, enforceable against the Owner Participant
in accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be

moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by the
application of general equitable principles which may limit the availability of
certain remedies. Any direction given by the Owner Participant to the Grantor
Trustee on the Closing Date pursuant to the Trust Agreement will have been duly
authorized.

         6.3 No Violation. The execution and delivery by the Owner Participant

bound.

         6.4 Owner Participant's Liens. There are no Owner Participant's Liens
on the Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate, or on any part of either thereof
and the execution, delivery and performance by the Owner Participant of the
Operative Documents to which it is a party will not subject the Trust Estate or
the Indenture Estate to any Owner Participant's Liens.

         6.5 Acquisition for Investment. The Owner Participant is acquiring its
interest in the Trust Estate for its own account for investment and not with a
view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution of any such interest

remain


                                       32
<PAGE>
within its control), except that the Owner Participant reserves the right to
transfer or assign any of or all such interest to the extent permitted by the
terms of this Agreement and the Trust Agreement.

         6.6 Securities Act. Neither the Owner Participant nor any Person
authorized by the Owner Participant has directly or indirectly offered or sold
any interest in the Trust Estate or the Secured Notes, or in any similar
security relating to the Undivided Interest, or in any security the offering of
which for the purposes of the Securities Act would be deemed to be part of the
same offering as the offering of the aforementioned securities to, or solicited
any offer to acquire any of the same from, any Person other than, in the case of
the Secured Notes, the Loan Participant, and neither the Owner Participant nor
any Person authorized to act on its behalf have taken or will take any action
which would subject the issuance or sale of any interest in the Trust Estate or
the Secured Notes to the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act or
require the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act except
to the extent required under Section 15 hereof.

         6.7 ERISA. The Owner Participant is not acquiring any part of its
interest in the Trust Estate with any ERISA Plan Assets.

company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

         6.9 Litigation. There is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding
pending or, to the Actual Knowledge of the Owner Participant, threatened against
the Owner Participant or the Guarantor or the properties of either of such
Persons before any Governmental Authority which, individually or in the
aggregate, is reasonably likely materially and adversely to affect the ability
of the Owner Participant or the Guarantor to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any other Operative Document to which it is a party.

         6.10 No Default. No Indenture Default or Indenture Event of Default
attributable to the Owner Participant has occurred and is continuing.

         6.11 Federal Reserve Regulations. No part of the proceeds of the

                                       33
<PAGE>

others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any such margin stock.

         6.12 No Brokers' Fees. Neither the Owner Participant nor any Person
acting on its behalf has taken any actions the effect of which would be to cause
the Lessee or any Loan Participant to be liable for any brokers', finders' or
agents' fees or commissions or costs of any nature or kind claimed by or on
behalf of brokers, finders or agents in respect of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not included in Transaction Expenses.

for (1) any Claim in respect of the Production System to the extent attributable
to acts, events, circumstances or conditions which arise, occur or exist after
(1) (i) the return of the Undivided Interest (other than a return under
conditions not in accordance with the Operative Documents or a return in
connection with a Lease Event of Default) or (ii) the purchase of the Lessor's
right, title and interest in and to the Undivided Interest and payment in full
of the applicable purchase price provided for under the Operative Documents and
payment of all other amounts due under the Operative Documents (except to the
extent that such Claim arises in respect of or relating to any period prior to
or simultaneously with the occurrence of the events described in (i) or (ii);
(2) any Claim to the extent resulting from the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of such Indemnitee (unless (i) such willful misconduct or gross
negligence is caused by any Lessee Person or (ii) such willful misconduct or
gross negligence is imputed to such Indemnitee by reason of its interest in the
Undivided Interest), (3) any Transaction Expense (other than any Transaction
Expense that the Lessee is obligated to pay pursuant to Section 2.9), (4) (A) in
the case of the Grantor Trustee and Claims related to the Indenture, any other
expense or Claim to the extent expressly provided under the Indenture to be paid
or borne by the Grantor Trustee at its own expense and for which the Grantor
Trustee is expressly not entitled to indemnity or reimbursement and (B) in the
case of any other Indemnitee and Claim, any other expense or Claim to the extent
expressly provided under any of the Operative Documents to be paid or borne by
such Indemnitee at its own expense or for which such

Indemnitee is expressly not entitled to indemnity or reimbursement, (5) any
Claim to the extent resulting from the offer, sale, disposition or transfer by
such Indemnitee of all or part of its interest in the Undivided Interest, the
Secured Notes, the Pass Through Certificates or the Trust Estate, other than any
such transfer or disposition (i) made while a Lease Event of Default is
continuing, (ii) in connection with an Event of Loss or any replacement,
removal, substitution, destruction, damage, theft, governmental taking,
confiscation, seizure, requisition of or to the Undivided Interest or any part
or portion thereof, (iii) pursuant to Section 6 or 7 of the Lease or Section 16
of this Agreement, (iv) to a successor Grantor Trustee, (v) made to the Lessee
or at the written request of the Lessee or (vi) otherwise expressly required by
the Operative Documents, and in any case this exclusion (5) shall apply only to
the extent such Claim is in excess of the total Claims that would have been
indemnifiable but for such offer, sale, disposition or transfer, (6) any Claim
to the extent resulting from a breach by such Indemnitee of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants in the Pass Through Trust Agreement or
in any of the Operative Documents or in any Officer's Certificate delivered
pursuant thereto or to the extent resulting from a violation of law by such
Indemnitee (other than any violation caused by any Lessee Person or imputed to
an Indemnitee solely by reason of its interest in the Undivided Interest),
unless such violation of law or breach is the result of the failure of any other
party to comply with its obligations under any Operative Document to which it is
a party (other than, in the case of the Owner Participant, such a failure by the
Grantor Trustee as a result of the written direction or instruction of the Owner
Participant in violation of the Operative Documents and, in the case of any Loan
Participant, such a failure by the Indenture Trustee as a result of the
direction or instruction of (or a vote or consent in favor of such direction or
instruction by) such Loan Participant), (7) any Claim to the extent relating to
Taxes (other than Taxes required to be paid to indemnify such Indemnitee under
this Section 12.1 on an After-Tax Basis) whether or not the Lessee is obligated
to indemnify for such Taxes under Section 12.2 or the Tax Indemnity Agreement,
(8) [Intentionally Omitted], (9) any Claim to the extent attributable to the
authorization or giving or withholding by such Indemnitee of any future
amendments, supplements, waivers or consents (whether or not entered into) with
respect to any Operative Document or the Pass Through Trust Agreement, other
than such as have been requested by the Lessee, or such that occur while a Lease
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or such as are expressly
required by any Operative Document or the Pass Through Trust Agreement or such
as are required to comply with any Governmental Rule, (10) any Claim resulting
from any Indenture Event of Default except to the extent caused by a Lease
Default or Lease Event of Default, (11) with respect to the Grantor Trustee, the
Trust Company, Laskaris

and the Owner Participant, any Claim resulting from the indemnity given by the
Owner Participant pursuant to Section 6.3 of the Trust Agreement or any
indemnification pursuant thereto, except to the extent that the Indemnitee under
such Section 6.3 would be otherwise entitled to indemnification from the Lessee
under this Section 12.1, (12) any Claim of the Pass Through Trustee to the
extent that it is indemnified by the Lessee pursuant to the Pass Through Trust
Agreement, (13) in the case of any Indemnitee other than the Owner Participant,
the failure on the part of the Indenture Trustee, the Grantor Trustee or the
Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, to distribute in accordance with the
Indenture, or the Trust Agreement, or the Pass Through Trust Agreement, as the
case may be, any amounts received and distributable by it thereunder, (14) in
the case of the Owner Participant, failure on the part of the Grantor Trustee to
distribute in accordance with the Trust Agreement any amounts received and
distributable by it thereunder, and (15) any Claim to the extent resulting from
the imposition of any Lien which such Indemnitee is required to lift and
discharge pursuant to any Operative Document (including for purposes of this
clause (15) any Lien which such Indemnitee would be required to lift and
discharge but for the proviso set forth in Section 11.1(a) or 11.2(a)(ii)). The
obligation to provide indemnities in accordance with the terms of this Section
12.1 shall survive the termination of the Lease.

                  (b) Notices. If the Lessee shall obtain knowledge of any
action, suit, proceeding or written notice of any Claim indemnified against
under this Section 12.1, the Lessee shall give prompt notice thereof to the
appropriate Indemnitee or Indemnitees, as the case may be, and if any Indemnitee
shall obtain any such knowledge, such Indemnitee shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Lessee provided that the failure of such Indemnitee to so notify
the Lessee shall not affect the Lessee's indemnification obligations under this
Section 12.1 to such Indemnitee except to the extent of any increase in the
amount of such Claim resulting from such failure or to the extent the Lessee is
effectively precluded from contesting such Claim as a result of such failure.

                  (c) Contests. Subject to the rights of insurers under policies
of insurance maintained pursuant to Section 13 of the Lease, the Lessee shall
have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to investigate, and the right in
its sole discretion to defend or contest by appropriate proceedings or
compromise, any Claim for which indemnification is sought under this Section
12.1, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the Lessee's expense, with all
reasonable requests of the Lessee in connection therewith, provided that the
Lessee shall not have the right without the consent of the Indemnitee to defend,
contest or compromise any claim with respect to such Indemnitee (i) if a



                                       63
<PAGE>

Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) if such
proceeding involves any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the
Undivided Interest, or (iii) if such Claim involves a realistic possibility of
criminal sanctions or criminal liability to such Indemnitee, in which event the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to control and assume responsibility for the
defense of such Claim at the expense of the Lessee. The Lessee will not be
required to acknowledge liability as a condition to exercising its contest
rights hereunder unless the Lessee assumes control of such contest. With respect
to any Claim, liability for which the Lessee shall have acknowledged to the
relevant Indemnitee in writing, in the event that in the course of the
investigation or defense of such Claim, the Lessee shall in good faith
reasonably determine that it is not liable for indemnification with respect
thereto, it may give notice to the applicable Indemnitee of such fact; and, in
such case, any acknowledgement therefore made by the Lessee of its liability
with respect to such Claim shall be deemed revoked, and the Lessee may thereupon
cease to defend such Claim, provided that (i) it shall have given the Indemnitee
reasonable prior notice of its intention to renounce such acknowledgment, (ii)
the Lessee's conduct regarding the defense of such Claim or any decision to
withdraw from such defense shall not materially prejudice or have materially
prejudiced the Indemnitee's ability to contest such Claim (taking into account,
among other things, the time of the Lessee's withdrawal and the theory or
theories upon which the Lessee shall have based its defense), and (iii) the
Lessee shall have given such Indemnitee all materials, documents and records
relating to its defense of such Claim as such Indemnitee shall have reasonably
requested in connection with the assumption by such Indemnitee of the defense of
such Claim at the cost and expense of such Indemnitee unless it is determined
that the Lessee is required to indemnify such Indemnitee for such Claim, in
which case at the cost and expense of the Lessee. In the event that the Lessee
shall cease to defend any Claim pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Lessee
shall indemnify each Indemnitee to the extent that the actions of the Lessee in
defending such Claim or the manner or time of the Lessee's election to withdraw
from the defense of such Claim shall have caused such Indemnitee to incur any
loss, cost, liability or expense which such Indemnitee might not have incurred
had the Lessee not ceased to defend such Claim in such manner or such time;
provided, however, that the Lessee shall not be required to indemnify such
Indemnitee to the extent that the Lessee shall have proven (in a judicial
proceeding or otherwise) that neither its manner of defending such Claim nor the
manner of time of its withdrawal from the defense of such Claim caused such
loss, cost, liability or expense. The Lessee will provide the Indemnitee with
such information not within the control of such Indemnitee, as is in the
Lessee's control or is reasonably available to the Lessee, which such Indemnitee
may reasonably request and shall



                                       64
<PAGE>

otherwise cooperate with such Indemnitee so as to enable such Indemnitee to
investigate or defend any Claim. The Lessee shall keep the Indemnitee which is
the subject of such proceeding fully apprised of the status of such proceeding
and shall provide such Indemnitee with all information with respect to such
proceeding as such Indemnitee shall reasonably request. In the event an
Indemnitee has assumed control of any such proceeding, it shall keep the Lessee
fully apprised of the status of such proceeding and shall provide the Lessee
with all information, including the receipt of all settlement offers, with
respect to such proceeding as such Indemnitee shall reasonably request. Where
the Lessee or the insurers under a policy of insurance maintained by the Lessee
undertake the defense of an Indemnitee with respect to a Claim, no additional
legal fees or expenses of such Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such
claim shall be indemnified hereunder unless such fees or expenses were incurred
at the request of the Lessee or such insurers; provided that, if (i) in the
written opinion of counsel to such Indemnitee an actual or potential material
conflict of interest exists where it is advisable for such Indemnitee to be
represented by separate counsel or (ii) such Indemnitee has been indicted or
otherwise charged in a criminal complaint in connection with a Claim not
excluded by Section 12.1(a) and such Indemnitee informs the Lessee that such
Indemnitee desires to be represented by separate counsel, the reasonable fees
and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Lessee. Subject to
the requirements of any policy of insurance, an Indemnitee may participate at
its own expense in any judicial proceeding controlled by the Lessee pursuant to
the preceding provisions and such participation shall not constitute a waiver of
the right to receive the indemnification provided in this Section 12.1.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except as otherwise
provided in the following sentence, during the continuance of a Lease Event of
Default, the Lessee shall not compromise any Claim without the consent of the
applicable Indemnitee unless such Claim is simultaneously discharged, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 12.1, to the extent the defense or settlement
of any Claim in respect of which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
hereunder is governed by the terms of the Operating Agreement, such defense or
settlement shall be governed by the Operating Agreement; provided, that the
defense or settlement of such Claim in accordance with the Operating Agreement
shall not limit the Lessee's obligations to indemnify such Claim pursuant to
this Section 12.1.

                  (d) Subrogation. Upon payment in full of any Claim by the
Lessee pursuant to this Section 12.1 to or on behalf of an Indemnitee, the
Lessee, without any further action, shall be subrogated to any and all claims
that such Indemnitee may have in



                                       65
<PAGE>

respect of the matters against which such indemnity was given (other than claims
under any insurance policies maintained by such Indemnitee). Such Indemnitee
agrees to cooperate with the Lessee and to execute such further instruments to
permit the Lessee, at the Lessee's expense, to pursue such claims, to the extent
reasonably requested by the Lessee.

                  (e) Refunds. Upon receipt by any Indemnitee of a repayment or
reimbursement of all or any part of any Claim for which the Lessee shall have
paid for any Indemnitee or for which the Lessee shall have reimbursed any
Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 12.1, such Indemnitee shall pay to the
Lessee, as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof, the amount of such
repayment or reimbursement plus any interest received by such Indemnitee on such
amount plus the amount of any tax savings realized by such Indemnitee as a
result of such payment made to the Lessee, but not in excess of the amount of
all prior payments made by the Lessee pursuant to this Section 12.1 with respect
to such Claim less the amount of all prior refunds paid by such Indemnitee with
respect to such Claim pursuant to this subsection (e).

                  (f) Payments; Verification. Any amount payable to any
Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 12.1 shall be paid to such Indemnitee
promptly upon receipt of a written demand therefor from such Indemnitee,
accompanied by a written statement describing the basis for such indemnity and
the computation of the amount so payable and, if requested by the Lessee, such
determination shall be verified by a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Lessee and the Indemnitee at the
Lessee's expense, unless such accounting firm determines that the amount payable
by the Lessee is less than 95 percent (95%) of the amount shown on such written
statement, in which case such verification shall be at such Indemnitee's
expense.

         12.2 General Tax Indemnification. (a)(i) Payment of Taxes. The Lessee
agrees that each payment of Rent pursuant to the Lease shall be free of all
withholding with respect to Taxes of any nature whatsoever, and in the event
that the Lessee shall be required by applicable law to make any such withholding
for any such payment, (x) Basic Rent payable shall be increased so that after
making all required withholdings the Tax Indemnitee receives an amount equal to
the Rent it would have received had such withholdings not been made, (y) the
Lessee shall make such withholdings and (z) the Lessee shall pay the full amount
withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with applicable law. If
for any reason, the Lessee is required to make any payment to a taxing authority
or to any Tax Indemnitee as a result of the application of the preceding
sentence or otherwise that relates to or is a result of any Tax imposed on or


                                       66
<PAGE>

with respect to any Tax Indemnitee which Tax (in whole or in part) is an
Excluded Tax under the terms of Section 12.2(b), then the Tax Indemnitee in
respect of whom such Tax is an Excluded Tax hereunder shall, within 30 days
after receipt of notice of payment of the Tax and appropriate payment
documentation with respect thereto, pay to the Lessee an amount which equals the
amount paid by the Lessee with respect to or as a result of such Excluded Tax
(including any expenses or other charges borne by the Lessee) increased by (but
subject to the proviso in Section 12.2(f)) the amount of tax savings to such Tax
Indemnitee attributable to the making of such payment to the Lessee. Each Tax
Indemnitee also agrees (subject to the proviso in Section 12.2(f)) to reimburse
the Lessee for any amounts withheld for which such Tax Indemnitee obtains a
credit or refund, within 30 days after receipt of such credit or refund.

                  (ii) Indemnity. Except as provided in Section 12.2(b), the
Lessee agrees to pay, and to indemnify, protect, defend, save and keep harmless
each Tax Indemnitee, on an After-Tax Basis, whether or not any or all of the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated in whole or in part, from and
against any and all taxes, impositions, fees, levies, assessments, duties,
withholdings, governmental claims or other charges of any nature whatsoever
(together with any related interest, fines, penalties or additions to tax),
including, without limitation, rental, income, withholding, sales, use,
transfer, leasing, personal property, excise, receipts, franchise, value-added,
stamp, filing, recording, documentation or license taxes, however imposed or
asserted, by any United States federal, state or local government or taxing
authority (including any possession or territory thereof) or any foreign
government or taxing authority or subdivision thereof, or any international
taxing authority or any subdivision or taxing authority of any thereof (all the
foregoing being herein collectively called "Taxes" or, separately, a "Tax"),
upon or with respect to (i) the Undivided Interest or any portion thereof or
interest therein, (ii) the acquisition, purchase, sale, financing, leasing,
subleasing, sub-subleasing and sub-sub-subleasing, ownership, maintenance,
repair, redelivery, alteration, insuring, control, use, operation, manufacture,
assembly, delivery, possession, repossession, location, storage, importation,
exportation, refinancing, refunding, transfer of title, registration,
reregistration, transfer of registration, return or other disposition thereof of
all or any part of the Undivided Interest or any portion thereof or interest
therein, (iii) the rental payments (including, without limitation, all Basic
Rent and Supplemental Rent), receipts or earnings arising from the Undivided
Interest or any portion thereof or interest therein, or payable pursuant to the
Lease, or any other payment or right to receive payment pursuant to the
Operative Documents or the Pass Through Trust Agreement or Pass Through
Certificates



                                       67
<PAGE>

(including, without limitation, any payment of principal, interest, discount or
premium on or with respect to the Secured Notes), (iv) any Modification or
replacement, removal, substitution or repair of a Component or Replacement
Component, (v) the Operating Agreement or the Operative Documents and any other
documents contemplated hereby or thereby and amendments and supplements thereto,
or the issuance, refunding, refinancing or resetting of the Secured Notes or the
Pass Through Certificates or any other document executed and delivered in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Operative Documents or the Pass Through Trust Agreement or the interest of any
Tax Indemnitee in any of the foregoing, or the execution, amendment, issuance or
delivery of any of the foregoing, (vi) the Indenture Estate or Trust Estate or
Pass Through Trusts or the property, or the income or other proceeds received
with respect to the property, held by the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture
or the Grantor Trustee under the Trust Agreement, or (vii) otherwise arising out
of, with respect to, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Operating Agreement or the Operative Documents, the Pass Through Certificates,
or the Pass Through Trust Agreement.

                  (b) Exclusions from General Tax Indemnity. Each of the
following shall constitute an Excluded Tax for purposes of Section 12.2(a)(1),
and the provisions of Section 12.2(a)(2) shall not apply to, and the Lessee
shall have no liability to a Tax Indemnitee under Section 12.2(a)(2) with
respect to:

                  (1) Taxes on a Tax Indemnitee (other than such Taxes that are
         sales, use, rental, property, stamp, document filing, license, or ad
         valorem Taxes, or value added Taxes that are in the nature of or in
         lieu of such Taxes) imposed on a Tax Indemnitee that are franchise

         withholding) which are imposed by any state, local, or other taxing
         authority within the United States or by any foreign or international
         taxing authority that would not have been imposed but for such Tax
         Indemnitee having a place of business, being incorporated or organized
         or being otherwise subject to such Tax, in each case, as a result of
         transactions or activities unrelated to the transactions contemplated
         by the Operative Documents, the Operating Agreement or the Pass Through
         Trust Agreement;



                                       68
<PAGE>

                  (2) Taxes on a Tax Indemnitee, including, without limitation,
         sales and transfer Taxes, that result from any voluntary or involuntary
         transfer by such Tax Indemnitee of any interest in the Undivided
         Interest, the Trust Estate, the Lease or any portion of any of the
         foregoing, or any interest arising out of the Operative Documents or
         any Pass Through Trust Agreement or the Secured Notes or Pass Through
         Certificates; provided, however, that this Section 12.2(b)(2) shall not
         apply to any transfer that (A) with respect to the Owner Participant,
         and its respective Affiliates, officers, directors, agents, and
         employees, occurs after a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, or, in the case of any other Tax Indemnitee, relates to the
         exercise of remedies in connection with a Lease Event of Default; (B)
         results from an Event of Loss or from any other destruction, damage,
         theft, or governmental taking, confiscation, seizure, or requisition of
         or to the Production System or any material part thereof that does not
         yet constitute an Event of Loss; (C) is required by the Operative
         Documents; (D) is made to the Lessee or another Person at the Lessee's
         direction; (E) results from the replacement, removal, substitution, or
         subleasing of all or any part of the Undivided Interest; or (F) occurs
         on the Closing Date in connection with the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents;

                  (3) Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on a Tax Indemnitee
         solely as a result of its activities in such jurisdiction unrelated to
         the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents or the Pass
         Through Trust Agreement;

                  (4) Taxes on a Tax Indemnitee that result from (A) the willful
         misconduct, gross negligence, or fraud of such Tax Indemnitee, (B) the
         breach or inaccuracy by such Tax Indemnitee of any of its
         representations, warranties or covenants and the failure to perform or
         observe any agreement under the Operative Documents or Pass Through
         Trust Agreement, unless, in the case of the Owner Participant and its
         respective Affiliates, officers, directors, agents, and employees, any
         such breach, inaccuracy or failure is caused by or results from any
         act, failure to act, or breach of representation, warranty, or covenant
         by any Lessee Person or any other party to the Operative Documents, the
         Operating Agreement or the Pass Through Trust Agreement:

                  (5) Taxes on a Tax Indemnitee that result from (A) the failure
         of such Tax Indemnitee to file tax returns properly and on a timely
         basis or to claim a deduction or credit to which it is entitled, or (B)
         the failure of such Tax Indemnitee to comply with certification,
         reporting or other similar requirements of the jurisdiction imposing
         such Tax; provided, however, that the exclusions set forth in
         subclauses (A) and (B) shall not apply if any such failure is the
         result of (x) the failure of the Lessee to (I) perform its obligations
         under Section 12.2(c), or to perform its duties and responsibilities
         pursuant to any of the Operative Documents or the Operating Agreement,
         (II) timely and properly notify such Tax Indemnitee of the applicable
         filing, certification, reporting or other



                                       69
<PAGE>

         similar requirements (including the availability of any deduction or
         credit other than with respect to any Taxes described as not
         indemnifiable in Section 12.2(b)(l)), or (III) provide reasonable
         assistance in complying with any such requirement; or (y) a
         determination by the Owner Participant in good faith that taking any
         action otherwise required in clause (A) or (B) of this subsection could
         result in any unindemnified adverse tax consequences or risk of
         unindemnified adverse tax consequences to the Grantor Trustee, the
         Trust Estate, or the Owner Participant or its respective Affiliates,
         officers, directors, agents, or employees, provided that the Owner
         Participant shall promptly (but, (i) with respect to reports, returns,
         certifications and statements required to be provided by the Lessee
         pursuant to Section 12.2(c) hereof, in no event later than 10 Business
         Days following the date any such item is provided, (ii) with respect to
         reports, returns and statements relating to Taxes described in Section
         12.2(b)(1) hereof that are indemnifiable notwithstanding that section,
         in no event later than 10 Business Days following the date the Lessee
         has provided information necessary to file such reports, returns, or
         statements (but only to the extent the Lessee is required to file such
         reports, returns or statements hereunder), and (iii) with respect to
         reports, returns or statements relating to Taxes described in Section
         12.2(b)(1) hereof that are not indemnifiable, in no event later than 10
         Business Days before the date the reports, returns, or statements are
         to be filed) provide the Lessee written notice identifying the nature
         of the unindemnified adverse tax consequences, (and, if the Lessee
         indemnifies the Grantor Trustee, the Trust Estate or the Owner
         Participant, as the case may be, and its respective Affiliates,
         officers, directors, agents and employees promptly for such
         unindemnified adverse tax consequences in a manner reasonably
         satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee (including for credit purposes),
         the exclusions set forth in subclauses (A) and (B) shall apply;

                  (6) Taxes which are attributable to any period or circumstance
         occurring after the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease,
         except to the extent attributable to (A) a failure of the Lessee to
         fully discharge its



                                       70
<PAGE>

         obligations under the Operative Documents, (B) Taxes imposed on or with
         respect to any payments that are due after the expiration or earlier
         termination of the Lease and which are attributable to a period or
         circumstance occurring prior to or simultaneously with such expiration
         or earlier termination;

                  (7) Taxes on the Grantor Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the
         Pass Through Trustee which are based on or measured by fees or
         compensation received by the Grantor Trustee for acting as Grantor
         Trustee under the Trust Agreement, the Indenture Trustee for acting as
         Indenture Trustee under the Indenture or the Pass Through Trustee for
         acting as Pass Through Trustee under the Pass Through Trust Agreement;

                  (8) Taxes on a Tax Indemnitee to the extent such Taxes would
         not have been imposed if such Tax Indemnitee were a United States
         person for United States federal income tax purposes;

                  (9) any Tax that is being contested in accordance with the
         provisions of Section 12.2(e) during the pendency of such contest, but
         only for so long as such contest is continuing in accordance with such
         Section and payment is not otherwise required pursuant to such Section;

                  (10) Taxes on a Tax Indemnitee as to which such Tax Indemnitee
         fails to comply with its contest obligations under Section 12.2(e) but
         only to the extent such failure precludes a contest and the Lessee has
         a reasonable basis for such contest; provided, however, that this
         Section 12.2(b) (10) shall not constitute a waiver by the Lessee of its
         rights, if any, to assert and sue upon any claims it may have against
         the Tax Indemnitee by reason of its failure to comply with its
         obligations under Section 12.2(e) of this Agreement;

                  (11) Taxes imposed as a result of (A) in the case of the Owner
         Participant, the Grantor Trustee, and their respective Affiliates,
         officers, directors, agents, and employees, the trust described in the
         Trust Agreement not being treated as a grantor trust or other conduit
         entity for federal, state or local tax purposes and (B) in the case of
         all other Tax Indemnitees, any of the Pass Through Trusts not being
         treated as a grantor trust or other conduit entity for federal, state,
         or local tax purposes;

                  (12) any Taxes imposed on a transferee or subsequent
         transferee to the extent of the excess of such Taxes over the total
         amount of the Taxes of the same or similar nature



                                       71
<PAGE>

         that would have been imposed had there not been a transfer by the
         initial Tax Indemnitee after the Closing Date (except in the case of a
         transfer by the Owner Participant or the Lessor which is described in
         clauses (A), (B), (C) or (E) of Section 12.2(b)(2) above) of (i) an
         interest in the Undivided Interest, or of a beneficial interest in the
         Trust Estate or any portion of any of the foregoing, or (ii) any
         interest arising under any Operative Document or any Pass Through Trust
         Agreement or any Secured Note or Pass Through Certificate;

                  (13) Taxes which have been included in Lessor's Cost;

                  (14) Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnitee that are United States
         federal net income Taxes of such Indemnitee including any Taxes which
         are the subject of the Tax Indemnity Agreement;

                  (15) Taxes imposed on the Grantor Trustee or the Owner
         Participant resulting from a Lessor's Lien or an Owner Participant's
         Lien, respectively;

                  (16) Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnitee resulting from an
         amendment to an Operative Document to which such Tax Indemnitee is a
         party which amendment is not consented to by the Lessee in writing or
         required by the Operative Documents;

                  (17) any Tax (other than a Tax imposed on the Owner
         Participant or the Grantor Trustee) in the nature of an intangible tax
         or similar tax upon or with respect to the value of the interest of the
         Indenture Estate or a Certificateholder, as the case may be, in any of
         the Secured Notes or Certificates imposed by any government or taxing
         authority; or

                  (18) Taxes resulting from any violation of ERISA or Section
         4975 of the Code.

         If the Lessee is required to pay any indemnity hereunder on an
After-Tax Basis, none of the exclusions in Section 12.2(b)(1) through (18) above
shall be read to exclude any Taxes that are not necessary to pay such indemnity
on an After-Tax Basis. Notwithstanding anything contained herein or any other
Operative Document to the contrary, the Lessee acknowledges and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Owner Participant and Grantor Trustee (in their
respective trust and individual capacities) on an After-Tax Basis against any
and all withholding Taxes (inclusive of any interest and penalties imposed for
any failure to timely withhold such Taxes) imposed on or with respect to any
amounts paid to a Loan Participant or any successor, assignee or



                                       72
<PAGE>

Affiliate thereof, as an indemnified Tax for purposes of this Section 12.2,
unless such withholding is due to the Owner Participant or the Grantor Trustee
not being a United States person for United States federal income tax purposes.
If a Tax (including any related interest, fines, penalties or addition to Tax)
(other than, in the case of the Owner Participant and the Grantor Trustee,
withholding taxes referred to in the previous sentence) results from a breach or
inaccuracy of any Tax Indemnitee of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants, or the failure to perform or observe any agreements under the
Operative Documents or the Pass Through Trust Agreement, unless, in the case of
the Owner Participant and its respective Affiliates, officers, directors, agents
and employees, any such breach, inaccuracy or failure is caused by or results
from any act, failure to act or breach of representation, warranty or covenant,
or the failure to perform any agreement of any Lessee Person or any other party
to the Operative Documents, the Operating Agreement or the Pass Through Trust
Agreement, and the Lessee is required to indemnify another Tax Indemnitee
against the imposition of such Tax, then the Tax Indemnitee whose breach or
failure resulted in the imposition of such Tax shall, within 30 days after
receipt of notice of payment of the Tax and appropriate payment documentation
with respect thereto, pay to the Lessee an amount which equals the amount paid
by the Lessee with respect to or as a result of such Tax (including any expenses
or other charges borne by the Lessee) increased by (but subject to the proviso
in Section 12.2(f)) the amount of tax savings to such Tax Indemnitee
attributable to the making of such payment to the Lessee.

         The provisions of this Section 12.2(b) shall not apply to any Taxes
imposed in respect of the receipt or accrual of any payment made by the Lessee
pursuant to Section 12.1 hereof, this Section 12.2 or pursuant to the Tax
Indemnity Agreement.

                  (c) Reports. If any report, return, certification or statement
is required to be filed with respect to any Tax that is subject to
indemnification under this Section 12.2, the Lessee shall timely prepare and
file the same (except for (i) any report, return or statement relating to any
net income Taxes described in Section 12.2(b)(1) or any Taxes in lieu of or
enacted in substitution for any of the foregoing, (ii) any report, return or
statement relating to any other Taxes described in Section 12.2(b)(1) or any
Taxes in lieu of or enacted in substitution for any of the foregoing, except
that, in such cases, the Lessee shall timely provide information necessary to
file such report, return or statement (but only to the extent the Lessee
collects and maintains such information in the ordinary course of its operations
if the relevant Tax Indemnitee otherwise collects and maintains such information
in the ordinary course of its operations) or (iii) any other report, return,
certification



                                       73
<PAGE>

or statement which the Tax Indemnitee has notified the Lessee that the Tax
Indemnitee intends to prepare and file); provided that such Tax Indemnitee shall
have furnished the Lessee, at the Lessee's expense, with such information
reasonably necessary to prepare and file such returns as is within such Tax
Indemnitee's control. The Lessee shall either file such report, return,
certification or statement (so as to show the ownership of the Undivided
Interest for tax purposes in the Grantor Trustee) and send a copy of such
report, return, certification or statement to the Owner Participant and the
Grantor Trustee, or, where not so permitted to file, shall notify the Owner
Participant and the Grantor Trustee of such requirement within a reasonable
period of time prior to the due date for filing (without regard to any
applicable extensions) and prepare and deliver such report, return,
certification or statement to the Owner Participant and the Grantor Trustee. In
addition, within a reasonable time prior to the time such report, return,
certification or statement is to be filed the Lessee shall, to the extent
permitted by law, cause all billings of such Taxes to be made to each Tax
Indemnitee in care of the Lessee, make payment thereof and furnish written
evidence of such payment. The Lessee shall furnish promptly upon written request
such data, records and documents as any Tax Indemnitee may reasonably require of
the Lessee to enable such Tax Indemnitee to comply with requirements of any
taxing jurisdiction arising out of such Tax Indemnitee's participation in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
requirements relating to Taxes described in Section 12.2(b)(1).

                  (d) Payments. Any Tax indemnified hereunder shall be paid
directly when due to the applicable taxing authority if direct payment is
permitted, or shall be reimbursed to a Tax Indemnitee on demand if paid by such
Tax Indemnitee in accordance herewith. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 12.2, all amounts payable to a Tax Indemnitee hereunder shall be paid
promptly in immediately available funds, but in no event later than the later of
(i) 10 Business Days after the date of such demand or (ii) 2 Business Days
before the date the Tax to which such amount payable hereunder relates is due or
is to be paid (ignoring extension of time) and shall be accompanied by a written
statement (which written statement shall, at the Lessee's request, as long as
payment is not delayed, be verified by a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Lessee and the Tax Indemnitee, such
verification to be at the Lessee's expense unless such accountants determine
that the amount payable by the Lessee is less than ninety-five percent (95%) of
the amount shown on such written statement, in which event such expense will be
paid by the Tax Indemnitee) describing in reasonable detail the Tax and the
computation of the amount payable. In the case of a Tax subject to
indemnification under this Section 12.2 which is



                                       74
<PAGE>

properly subject to a contest in accordance with Section 12.2(e), the Lessee (i)
shall be obligated to make any advances with respect to such Tax whenever
required under Section 12.2(e) and (ii) shall pay such Tax (in the amount
finally determined to be owing in such contest) on an After-Tax Basis prior to
the latest time permitted by the relevant taxing authority for timely payment
after a Final Determination.

                  (e) Contests; Refunds. (i) In the event a taxing jurisdiction
makes a claim with respect to any Tax for which the Lessee is liable under this
Section 12.2 (a "Tax Claim"), the Lessee may cause the applicable Tax Indemnitee
to contest such Tax Claim as set forth herein. In the event any Tax Indemnitee
receives notice of a Tax Claim or potential Tax Claim which is indemnifiable
under this Section 12.2, such Tax Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Lessee
thereof, but the failure to give such notice shall not diminish the Lessee's
obligation hereunder, except to the extent that the Lessee's right to contest
such Tax Claim or potential Tax Claim is foreclosed thereby, unless the Tax
Indemnitee delivers an opinion of independent tax counsel that no reasonable
basis exists for the Tax Indemnitee to prevail (except if the Lessee shall have
provided to the Tax Indemnitee at the Lessee's sole expense an opinion of the
Lessee's independent tax counsel, such tax counsel being reasonably acceptable
to the Tax Indemnitee, to the effect that a reasonable basis exists for such
contest). If requested by the Lessee in writing within 30 days of receipt of
such notice (or, if sooner, on or before the last date upon which the contest of
such Tax can practicably be initiated in good faith, provided that the Tax
Indemnitee's notice to the Lessee discloses such date), such Tax Indemnitee
shall, provided that (I) it has received an indemnity satisfactory to it whereby
the Lessee shall have agreed to pay and shall pay to such Tax Indemnitee on an
After-Tax Basis all reasonable costs, expenses, losses, legal and accountants'
fees and disbursements, and all penalties, fines, additions to tax and interest
in connection with contesting such Tax Claim and (II) no Lease Event of Default
or Lease Default described in Section 15(a), (b), (c), (f) or (g) of the Lease
shall have occurred and be continuing, and at the expense of the Lessee, contest
or permit the Lessee to contest the imposition of any Tax Claim by (1) resisting
payment thereof, if such Tax Indemnitee in its reasonable discretion shall
determine such course of action to be appropriate, (2) not paying the same
except under protest, if protest is necessary and proper, or (3) if payment
shall be made, using reasonable efforts to obtain a refund thereof in
appropriate administrative and judicial proceedings, or both; provided, however,
that (i) in no event will such Tax Indemnitee be required to contest or permit a
contest or continue to contest any Tax Claim unless such Tax Indemnitee and the
Owner Participant shall have reasonably determined that the action to be taken
will not result in (a) any material risk of sale,



                                       75
<PAGE>

forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any lien (except if the Lessee shall
have adequately bonded such lien, or otherwise made provision to protect the
interests of such Tax Indemnitee and the Owner Participant in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee and the Owner Participant) on,
the Undivided Interest, any part thereof or interest therein or (b) any risk of
criminal penalties and (ii) if such contest shall involve payment of the Tax
Claim, the Lessee shall have advanced to such Tax Indemnitee the amount of such
payment plus interest, penalties and additions to tax with respect thereto on an
interest-free basis, and shall indemnify the Tax Indemnitee, on an After-Tax
Basis, for any adverse tax consequences resulting from such advance. If
permitted by applicable law, the Lessee may contest, at its own expense, the
imposition of any Tax Claim if (i) the proviso in the preceding sentence is
satisfied, (ii) such claim involves only Taxes for which the Lessee is liable to
the taxing authority, (iii) the Lessee shall have delivered to the Tax
Indemnitee a written acknowledgment of its liability under this Section 12.2 for
such Taxes (provided, however, that the Lessee will not be bound by its
acknowledgment of liability if the contest is resolved on the basis of a written
decision of the adjudicator that clearly indicates the basis for the conclusion
that the Lessee has no liability under this Section 12.2 with respect to such
Tax, unless the Lessee's conduct of the contest has materially prejudiced the
Tax Indemnitee), (iv) the participation of the Tax Indemnitee is not required,
(v) no Tax return of the Tax Indemnitee is held open as a result of such
contest, and (vi) the Tax Indemnitee may not be reasonably viewed as having
actual or potential liability for Taxes not indemnifiable by the Lessee
hereunder relating to the contest. In any contest controlled by a Tax
Indemnitee, the Tax Indemnitee shall consult in good faith with the Lessee
concerning the method and forum of such contest, but the Tax Indemnitee shall
retain the ultimate control over such contest. The Lessee shall have control
over any contest conducted by the Lessee pursuant to the terms hereof, but shall
consult in good faith with the Tax Indemnitee concerning the method and forum of
such contest. The Lessee shall keep the Tax Indemnitee fully informed as to the
nature, conduct and results of any contest conducted in the name of the Tax
Indemnitee. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 12.2 to the
contrary, no Tax Indemnitee shall be required to contest any Tax Claim (in a
proceeding that involves taxes unrelated to the transactions contemplated by the
Operative Documents) unless such Tax Indemnitee shall have received an opinion
of such independent tax counsel as may be selected by the Tax Indemnitee and
reasonably acceptable to the Lessee, furnished at the Lessee's sole expense, to
the effect that there is a reasonable basis to contest such Tax Claim. A Tax
Indemnitee shall not make, accept or enter into a settlement or other compromise
with respect to any Taxes indemnified pursuant to this Section 12.2 (which
proceeding the Tax Indemnitee is required to



                                       76
<PAGE>

continue), or forego or terminate any such proceeding with respect to Taxes
indemnified pursuant to this Section 12.2, without the prior written consent of
the Lessee provided that the Lessee shall have acknowledged that the contest is
with respect to a Tax Claim that would result in a Tax indemnifiable under this
Section 12.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Tax Indemnitee refuses to
contest any Tax Claim or effects a settlement or compromise of any such Tax that
the Tax Indemnitee is required to contest or is required not to settle or
compromise or otherwise terminates any such contest in violation of the terms
hereof without such prior written consent of the Lessee (but not with respect to
any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Tax Indemnitee
to contest such Tax Claim), such Tax Indemnitee shall be deemed to have waived
its right to any indemnity payment by the Lessee that would otherwise be payable
by the Lessee pursuant to this Section 12.2 in respect of such Tax Claim and any
other tax claim the contest of which may be effectively precluded by such
settlement or compromise, and shall have no further obligation or liability to
the Lessee with respect to such contest or settlement. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Section 12.2 to the contrary, the Tax Indemnitee shall not be
required to contest any claim if the subject matter thereof shall be of a
continuing nature and shall have previously been decided adversely by a court of
competent jurisdiction pursuant to the contest provisions of this Section 12.2,
unless there shall have been a change in law (or interpretation thereof) or a
change in facts after the date with respect to which such previous contest shall
have been decided, and the Tax Indemnitee shall have received, at the Lessee's
expense, an opinion of independent tax counsel selected by the Lessee and
reasonably acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee to the effect that as a result of
such change in law (or interpretation thereof) or a change in facts, there is
substantial authority (applying the principles of Section 6662(d) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) for the position asserted by the Tax
Indemnitee in such contest.

         (ii) Upon receipt by any Tax Indemnitee of a repayment or refund of all
or any part of any Tax which the Lessee shall have paid for, or advanced to,
such Tax Indemnitee or for which the Lessee shall have reimbursed such Tax
Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 12.2, such Tax Indemnitee shall pay to the
Lessee, as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof, the amount of such
repayment or refund plus any interest received by, or credited to, such Tax
Indemnitee on such amounts net of Taxes thereon plus the amount of any net tax
savings actually realized by such Tax Indemnitee as a result of the payment made
to the Lessee; provided, however, that: (A) such Tax Indemnitee shall not be
obligated to make such payment with respect to any net tax savings to the extent
that the amount of such payment would exceed (x) all prior indemnity payments
(excluding costs and





                                       77
<PAGE>

expenses incurred with respect to contests) made by the Lessee with respect to
such Tax pursuant to this Section 12.2 and less (y) the amount of all prior
payments by such Tax Indemnitee to the Lessee hereunder with respect to such Tax
(but any such excess shall be applied against, and reduce pro tanto, any future
payment due such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 12.2); (B) if there is
(1) a subsequent loss of any such tax savings or refund realized by the Tax
Indemnitee or (2) a reduction of an amount otherwise payable to a Tax Indemnitee
hereunder as a result of any such tax savings or refund, such loss or reduction
shall be treated as a Tax for which the Lessee must indemnify such Tax
Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 12.2 without regard to the exclusions set
forth in Sections 12.2(b) and 12.2(c), other than the exclusions set forth in
Sections 12.2(b)(4)(A), (7) and (13); and (C) no payment shall be made by any
Tax Indemnitee while a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing.

                  (f) Tax Savings. If, by reason of any payment made to or for
the account of a Tax Indemnitee by the Lessee pursuant to this Section 12.2,
such Tax Indemnitee at any time realizes a reduction in any Taxes for which the
Lessee is not required to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this Section
12.2 and which was not taken into account previously in computing such payment
by the Lessee to or for the account of such Tax Indemnitee, then such Tax
Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Lessee an amount equal to such actual
reduction in Taxes, plus the amount of any additional reduction in Taxes of such
Tax Indemnitee attributable to the payment made by such Tax Indemnitee to the
Lessee pursuant to this sentence. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, (A)
such Tax Indemnitee shall not be obligated to make such payment with respect to
any net tax savings to the extent that the amount of such payment would exceed
(x) all prior indemnity payments (excluding costs and expenses incurred with
respect to contests) made by the Lessee with respect to such Tax pursuant to
this Section 12.2 and less (y) the amount of all prior payments by such Tax
Indemnitee to the Lessee hereunder with respect to such Tax (but any such excess
shall be applied against, and reduce pro tanto, any future payment due such Tax
Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 12.2); (B) if there is a (i) subsequent loss
of any such tax savings or refund realized by the Tax Indemnitee or any tax
savings taken into account for purposes of determining "After-Tax Basis" or (ii)
a reduction of an amount otherwise payable to a Tax Indemnitee hereunder as a
result of any such tax savings or refund, such loss or reduction shall be
treated as a Tax for which the Lessee must indemnify such Tax Indemnitee
pursuant to this Section 12.2 without regard to the exclusions set forth in
Sections 12.2(b) and 12.2(c), other than the exclusions set forth in Sections
12.2(b)(4)(A), (7) and (13); and (C) no payment shall




                                       78

<PAGE>

be made by any Tax Indemnitee while a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing.

                  (g) Definition of Owner Participant. For purposes of this
Section 12.2, the term "Owner Participant" and the term Tax Indemnitee as
applied to the Owner Participant shall include any member of an affiliated
group, within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code (or any successor
provision thereof), of which the Owner Participant is, or may become, a member,
if consolidated, joint or combined returns are filed for such affiliated group
for federal, state or local income tax purposes. The Owner Participant
undertakes on behalf of such other members of its affiliated group to perform or
cause to be performed all obligations of such affiliated group hereunder.

         12.3 No Guarantee. Nothing in Section 12.1 or 12.2 shall be construed
as a guaranty by the Lessee of the useful life or residual value in the
Undivided Interest or as a guaranty of the Secured Notes.

         12.4 Opinion in Connection with Refunding of Senior Notes or
Adjustments to Rent Percentages. In connection with any refunding or refinancing
of the Secured Notes pursuant to Section 15 of this Agreement or any adjustment
of the Basic Rent Percentages pursuant to Section 4 of the Lease to which the
proviso set forth in Section 4.2 of the Lease applies, if the Lessee shall fail
to provide the Owner Participant with an opinion of tax counsel selected by the
Lessee but reasonably acceptable to the Owner Participant in form and substance
to the effect that such refunding (or refinancing) or adjustment, as the case
may be, more likely than not will not result in a greater risk of an
unindemnified tax liability on the part of the Owner Participant, then the
Lessee shall provide the Owner Participant with tax indemnity in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant (including credit
support).

SECTION 13. TRANSFER OF OWNER PARTICIPANT'S INTEREST.

         13.1 Restrictions on Transfer. Without the prior written consent of, so
long as the Lease shall be in effect, the Lessee, and, so long as the Lien of
the Indenture shall be in effect, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Participant
shall not, directly or indirectly, assign, convey or otherwise transfer (whether
by consolidation, merger, sale of assets or otherwise) any of its right, title
or interest in and to the Trust Estate, this Agreement, the Trust Agreement or
any other Operative Document except in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Section 13; provided that in the case of any transfer that occurs while
a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (i) the conditions to
transfer set forth in Sections 13.2 (d) and (e) shall not apply, (ii) the
conditions to transfer set forth in



                                       79

<PAGE>

Section 13.2(a) shall be modified such that the only remaining requirement under
such Section is that the transferee shall have a net worth at the time of
transfer of at least $10,000,000 and (iii) the conditions to transfer in Section
13.2(f) shall be modified such that the Lessee shall not be entitled to require
that the opinion referred to in said Section be in form and substance
satisfactory to the Lessee.

         13.2 Permitted Transfers. The Owner Participant may transfer all or
part of its right, title and interest in and to the Trust Estate (whether or not
the same shall then have been pledged or mortgaged under the Indenture, but
subject to the Lien of the Indenture if then in effect) and in and to this
Agreement and the other Operative Documents to any Person (a "Transferee") only
in compliance with and upon satisfaction of the following conditions:

                  (a) the Transferee (i) shall be, or shall be an Affiliate of,
         a financial institution, leasing company or other institutional
         investor having a tangible net worth at the time of at least
         $75,000,000 (or shall provide a guarantee in form and substance
         reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee of all
         its obligations under the Operative Documents to which it is a party by
         an entity having a tangible net worth at the time of at least
         $75,000,000), or (ii) shall be an Affiliate of the Owner Participant
         that either (x) has a net worth of at least $75,000,000 or (y) has its
         obligations under the Operative Documents guaranteed by the Owner
         Participant (or if at the time of transfer the Owner Participant's
         obligations are guaranteed pursuant to the Guaranty, by the Guarantor)
         pursuant to a guaranty in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
         the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee; and in the case of either (i) or
         (ii) such Transferee shall not be a Competitor of the Lessee;

                  (b) no such transfer shall violate any provision of, or create
         a relationship which would be in violation of, any applicable
         Governmental Rules, including, without limitation, applicable
         securities laws, any agreement to which the Owner Participant or the
         Transferee is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound or
         any Governmental Actions;

                  (c) the Transferee shall enter into an agreement substantially
         in the form of Exhibit B and shall have delivered to the Grantor
         Trustee and the Lessee an Officer's Certificate of the Transferee
         stating that the representations and warranties contained therein shall
         be true and correct on the date of transfer;



                                       80
<PAGE>

                  (d) the transferring Owner Participant shall have provided 10
         Business Days prior written notice of such transfer to the Grantor
         Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee, which notice shall
         specify (i) such information and be accompanied by evidence as shall be
         reasonably necessary to establish compliance with this Section 13 and
         Section 12.7 of the Trust Agreement and (ii) the name and address (for
         the purpose of giving notice as contemplated by the Operative
         Documents) of the Transferee;

                  (e) the transferring Owner Participant shall pay or cause to
         be paid all reasonable fees, out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and
         costs (including, without limitation, legal and other professional fees
         and expenses) incurred by the Grantor Trustee, the Loan Participants,
         the Indenture Trustee or the Lessee in connection with any transfer
         pursuant to this Section 13 (other than fees and expenses incurred in
         unsuccessfully challenging, through any action, suit or proceeding, the
         Owner Participant's right to make such transfer);

                  (f) the transferring Owner Participant or the Transferee shall
         have delivered to the Grantor Trustee and the Lessee and, if the Lien
         of the Indenture shall then be in effect, the Indenture Trustee, an
         opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
         each of them, as to the due authorization, execution, delivery and
         enforceability of the agreement or agreements referred to in clause (c)
         of this Section 13.2, and as to the matters referred to in clause (b)
         of this Section 13.2; and

                  (g) the Transferee shall be a "United States Person" as
         defined in the Code.

         13.3 Request for Acknowledgment. In connection with any proposed
transfer, assignment or assumption under Section 13.2, the Owner Participant may
by notice to the Lessee, the Indenture Trustee and Chadbourne & Parke LLP, at
the addresses set forth for such Persons in Schedule 1 hereto, at least 20
Business Days prior to the anticipated date of the proposed transfer or
assignment, request that the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee acknowledge that
any or all of the conditions precedent or requirements contained in Section 13.2
have been met, and such acknowledgment shall be promptly (and in any event with
respect to each such party no more than 10 Business Days after such notice shall
have been given) granted to the extent that such conditions or requirements are
met. In connection therewith, the Owner Participant shall provide the Lessee and
the Indenture Trustee with (a) an Officer's Certificate of the Owner Participant
signed on behalf of the Owner Participant by a Responsible Officer of the Owner
Participant to the effect that



                                       81
<PAGE>

all of the conditions precedent or requirements contained in Section 13.2 have
been met and (b) all the information necessary, or with any information that the
Lessee or the Indenture Trustee may reasonably request, in order for the Lessee
and the Indenture Trustee to make such determination. If the Lessee or the
Indenture Trustee fails to respond on or prior to the 30th day after receipt of
any such notice, the Lessee or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, shall
be deemed to have given its acknowledgment that such conditions precedent or
requirements have been met.

         13.4 Effect of Transfer. From and after any transfer effected in
accordance with this Section 13, the Owner Participant making such transfer
shall be released, to the extent of the obligations assumed by the Transferee,
from its liability hereunder and under the other Operative Documents to which it
is or is to be a party and under the Agency and Support Agreement in respect of
obligations to be performed on or after the date of such transfer. Upon any
transfer by the Owner Participant in accordance with this Section 13, the
Transferee shall be deemed an "Owner Participant" for all purposes of the
Operative Documents and each reference herein to the Owner Participant making
such transfer shall thereafter be deemed a reference to such Transferee for all
purposes, except as provided in the preceding sentence. In addition, except in
the case of a transfer to an Affiliate of the Owner Participant in accordance
with Section 13.2(a)(ii)(y), upon any transfer made in accordance with this
Section 13, the Guaranty, if any, shall be released to the extent the obligation
of the Owner Participant under the Operative Documents are assumed by the
Transferee or, if applicable a new Guarantor. Any transfer that is not in
accordance with this Section 13 shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall be
null and void; provided that the failure by the transferring Owner Participant
to provide 10 Business Days prior written notice of a transfer in accordance
with Section 13.2(d) shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement if such
failure is cured within 10 days after the earlier of receipt by the Owner
Participant of written notice thereof from the Lessee or the date the Owner
Participant obtains Actual Knowledge of such failure; and provided further that
the failure by the Owner Participant to pay fees and expenses in accordance with
Section 13.2(e) shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement if such failure
is cured within 60 days after the earlier of receipt by the Owner Participant of
written notice thereof from the Lessee, the Grantor Trustee, the Loan
Participants or the Indenture Trustee or the date the Owner Participant obtains
Actual Knowledge of such failure.

SECTION 14. FINANCING FOR MODIFICATIONS.

         14.1 Financing for Modifications. The Lessee shall give the Grantor
Trustee, the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee any required notice of
a Modification to the Production System pursuant to Section 11.6(b) of the
Lease. Upon receipt of such notice, and so long as no Lease Default described in
paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (g) of the definition of Lease Event of Default in
Section 15 of the Lease and no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Owner Participant shall cause the Lessor to finance the cost of
the Lessor's Share of such Modification through the issuance of Additional Notes
under the Indenture, on terms and conditions (including additional credit
support to the extent required by Section 10.14 after giving effect to any
adjustment in Stipulated Loss Value as a result of the issuance of Additional
Notes) mutually acceptable to the Owner Participant and the Lessee; provided
that any issuance and sale by the Grantor Trustee of Additional Notes shall be
in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.08 of
the Indenture (including, without limitation, the condition that such Additional
Notes may not rank senior (but may rank pari passu or junior) in any respect to
other Secured Notes issued under the Indenture).

         On the closing date of any Supplemental Financing, the Basic Rent
Percentages, Stipulated Loss Value Percentages, Termination Value Percentages,
Early Buy-Out Percentages and Fixed Price Purchase Amount shall be adjusted in
accordance with Section 4 of the Lease. No Additional Notes may be issued
without the prior written consent of the Lessee.

SECTION 15. REFUNDING OF SECURED NOTES.

         15.1 Refunding of Secured Notes. Upon compliance with the terms and
conditions of this Section 15, including, without limitation, the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Section 15.2 and in Section 3.05 of the
Indenture, the Lessee shall have the right, at its option and expense, on two
occasions during the Lease Term to cause the Grantor Trustee to refund or
refinance the Secured Notes and/or any Additional Notes then Outstanding (the
"Refunded Secured Notes") through the issuance and sale in the public or private
market of one or more additional series of Secured Notes (the "Refunding Secured
Notes"), in an aggregate principal amount which shall be equal to the unpaid
principal amount of the Refunded Secured Notes plus any accrued and unpaid
interest on the Refunded Secured Notes not paid by Lessee as contemplated in
clause (d) of this Section 15.1, the proceeds of such issuance and sale to be
applied to prepay or redeem the principal amount of such Refunded Secured Notes
and subject to the following conditions:


                                       83

<PAGE>

                  (a) the expenses of any such refunding or refinancing
         (including, without limitation, any premium payable with respect to the
         Secured Notes) shall be borne by the Lessee;

                  (b) the Owner Participant will not suffer any unindemnified
         adverse tax consequences (as determined in accordance with and subject
         to Section 12.4) and Owner Participant will receive an opinion of its
         counsel and reasonably acceptable to the Lessee to such effect;
         provided, however, that, in the absence of a change in applicable tax
         law, Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service published revenue
         ruling, revenue procedure or notice after the Closing Date, the Secured
         Notes are "qualified nonrecourse indebtedness" and any such refinancing
         taken together with each other refinancing, that does not (i) result in
         an increase in principal amount greater than 5.0% of the remaining
         principal amount of the Secured Notes or, as applicable any Additional
         Notes or (ii) increase in term or average life that exceeds the
         remaining term or average life, as applicable, of the original Secured
         Notes by more than six months, shall be treated as not causing a
         material adverse tax effect under Section 861 of the Code;

                  (c) the appropriate parties will enter into a note purchase
         agreement providing for the issuance and sale by the Grantor Trustee or
         such other party as may be appropriate on the date specified in such
         agreement (for the purposes of this Section 15.1, the "Refunding Date")
         of Refunding Secured Notes the proceeds of which shall be used to repay
         all of the Outstanding Refunded Secured Notes on the Refunding Date;

                  (d) if the Refunding Date is during the Basic Lease Term, the
         Lessee and the Grantor Trustee will amend the Lease such that if the
         Refunding Date is not a Basic Rent Payment Date, the Lessee shall on
         the Refunding Date prepay that portion of the next succeeding
         installment of Basic Rent to the extent necessary to pay the aggregate
         interest accrued on the Refunded Secured Notes not payable with the
         proceeds of the Refunding Secured Notes;

                  (e) the Grantor Trustee will enter into an agreement to
         provide for the securing thereunder of the Refunding Secured Notes in
         like manner as the Refunded Secured Notes and/or will enter into such
         amendments and supplements to the Indenture as may be necessary to
         effect a refunding or refinancing under this Section 15.1, which
         agreements, amendments and/or supplements shall be satisfactory in form
         and substance to the Owner Participant;



                                       84
<PAGE>

                  (f) the identity of the Owner Participant shall not be
         disclosed in offering materials used in connection with such refunding
         or refinancing pursuant to a public offering;

                  (g) unless otherwise agreed by the Owner Participant, the
         Lessee shall pay to the Grantor Trustee as Supplemental Rent an amount
         equal to the Premium, if any, payable in respect of the Refunded
         Secured Notes and all reasonable fees, costs, expenses of such
         refunding or refinancing, including, without limitation, the Owner
         Participant's out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable counsel fees and
         expenses;

                  (h) the Lessee shall cause a legal opinion in form and
         substance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant, the Grantor
         Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee to be
         addressed to the Owner Participant, the Grantor Trustee, the Indenture
         Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee with respect to federal or state
         securities laws and insofar as such laws relate to the refunding or
         refinancing; and

                  (i) such additional documents, certificates, opinions as shall
         be reasonably requested by, and acceptable to, the Grantor Trustee and
         the Indenture Trustee, including, but not limited to, such documents,
         financing statements and opinions as are reasonably necessary to
         confirm that the refinancing of all Secured Notes of the series as to
         which the refinancing is occurring is being carried out.

         In connection with any such refunding or refinancing, the Basic Rent
Percentages, Stipulated Loss Value Percentages, Termination Value Percentages
and the Early Buy-Out Percentages and the amount of Credit Support shall be
adjusted in accordance with Section 4 of the Lease. The Secured Notes may not be
refunded or refinanced without the prior written consent of the Lessee.

         15.2 Notice. The Lessee shall give the other parties to this Agreement
at least 90 days' prior written notice of any desired refunding or refinancing
pursuant to Section 15.1, which notice shall set forth to the extent practicable
the proposed terms and conditions of such refunding or refinancing, including
the desired date therefor. The Lessee, the Grantor Trustee, the Owner
Participant and, as necessary, the Indenture Trustee and the Loan Participants,
shall consult thereafter on the good faith negotiation of such terms and
conditions to the end that, subject to the provisions of this Section 15, the
final terms and conditions of such refunding shall be agreed among the parties
thereto in due course thereafter. The Lessee will provide notice promptly to
such Persons in the event that it determines not to



                                       85
<PAGE>

proceed with such proposed refunding or refinancing pursuant to Section 15.1.

         15.3 Rights of Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 15, in no event shall the Owner Participant have any
obligation to initiate or structure any refunding or refinancing of Secured
Notes or to take, or to cause the Grantor Trustee to take, any action in
connection therewith other than such as may be requested by the Lessee, the
Owner Participant or the Indenture Trustee as provided in this Section 15.

SECTION 16. BENEFICIAL INTEREST PURCHASE OPTION.

         16.1 Option to Purchase. In the event and at the time that the Lessee
has the right to purchase all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to
the Undivided Interest pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Lease, the Lessee in lieu
of exercising such right may elect to purchase the right, title and interest of
the Owner Participant in and to the Trust Estate (the "Beneficial Interest") at
a purchase price equal to the excess of (i) the applicable purchase price
payable under Section 6.1 over (ii) the outstanding principal and accrued
interest on the Secured Notes as of the applicable purchase date (after giving
effect to the payment of all amounts required to be paid by the Lessee pursuant
to Section 16.2(b)) (the "Beneficial Interest Purchase Price"). It is intended
among the parties hereto that the purchase of the Beneficial Interest by the
Lessee shall not effect a merger of the Lessee's interest, as lessee, in the
Lease and the beneficial interest in the Trust Estate to be purchased by the
Lessee. Such purchase shall be consummated pursuant to an assignment and
assumption agreement which shall at a minimum preserve Owner Participant's
rights which are expressly stated to survive any purchase.

         16.2 Notice of Election; Manner of Purchase Transfer After Purchase.
(a) In order to exercise its right to purchase the Beneficial Interest pursuant
to Section 16.1, the Lessee shall notify the Owner Participant irrevocably in
writing no later than 90 days prior to the applicable purchase date under
Section 6.1 of the Lease that it desires to purchase the Beneficial Interest.

                  (b) On the date of purchase, upon receipt by the Owner
Participant of the Beneficial Interest Purchase Price, and all Basic Rents due
by the Lessee to or distributable to the Owner Participant on or prior to such
date of purchase (but excluding any Basic Rent payable in advance on such date
of purchase) and all Supplemental Rent due by the Lessee to or distributable to
the Owner Participant to and including such date of purchase (without giving
effect to any applicable grace periods), the Owner Participant shall transfer
the Beneficial Interest free and



                                       86
<PAGE>

clear of all Liens to the Lessee pursuant to an instrument of conveyance in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee.

                  (c) Each of the Participants, the Grantor Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee, at the cost and expense of the Lessee, will cause to be
promptly and duly taken, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further
acts, documents and assurances as the Lessee reasonably may request in order to
carry out the intent and purposes of this Section 16 and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

                  (d) As a condition to the Lessee's right to purchase the
Beneficial Interest pursuant to Section 16.1 (unless the Lessee shall assume the
obligations of the Grantor Trustee pursuant to the next sentence), on the date
of purchase the Lessee shall have provided to the Indenture Trustee an opinion
of counsel for the Lessee, dated the date of purchase, which, subject to usual
or customary exceptions, shall be to the effect that upon consummation of such
purchase, this Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Lease constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Lessee, enforceable against the
Lessee in accordance with its terms except as the same may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and by general principles of equity,
and except as limited by applicable laws that may affect the remedies provided
for in the Lease, which laws, however, do not in the opinion of such counsel
make the remedies provided for in the Lease inadequate for the practical
realization of the rights and benefits provided for in the Lease. In the event
the Lessee is unable to provide such opinion, concurrently with the purchase of
the Beneficial Interest the Lessee shall assume the obligations of the Grantor
Trustee under the Secured Notes and under the Indenture in accordance with and
with the effect provided in Section 3.04 of the Indenture and Section 11.6
hereof.

Agreement nor the Indenture may be amended, waived, supplemented or modified to

jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering
unenforceable any remaining terms and provisions hereof, and any such invalidity
or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties shall

tax liability of the recipient or deemed recipient of such payment (which net
increase shall be calculated by taking into account any reduction in such taxes
resulting from any tax benefits currently realized by the recipient as a result
of the event giving rise to such payment) shall be equal to the amount required
to be paid. In calculating the amount payable by reason of this provision, all
foreign, federal, state and local income taxes payable and tax benefits realized
shall be determined on the assumption that (A) in the case of the Owner
Participant, (i) for Federal income tax purposes, the Owner Participant has a
sufficient U.S. Federal tax base to be taxable on all income at the highest
marginal net income tax rate then applicable to corporate taxpayers taxed on the
same basis as the Owner Participant that are then in effect and that all
corresponding tax benefits are utilized at the highest marginal U.S. Federal tax
rate then applicable to corporate taxpayers taxed on the same basis as the Owner
Participant that are then in effect; and (ii) for state income tax purposes, the
Owner Participant is taxable on all income and utilizes all corresponding tax
benefits at the assumed state income tax rate as set forth in the Tax Indemnity
Agreement; and (B) in all other cases, (i) the recipient has a sufficient U.S.
Federal and state income tax base to be taxable on all income at the highest
marginal net income tax rates then applicable to corporate taxpayers taxed on
the same basis as the recipient that are then in effect in the applicable
jurisdictions and that all corresponding tax benefits are utilized at the
highest marginal U.S. Federal and state rates then applicable to corporate
taxpayers taxed on the same basis as the recipient that are then in effect in
the applicable jurisdiction; and (ii) state income taxes are payable, and state
tax benefits are realized, in the jurisdiction in which the recipient has its
principal place of business.

         "Agency and Support Agreement" shall mean the Agency and Support

<PAGE>

the delivery of written notification as specified in the Operative Documents by
the Lessee to the Lessor or the Owner Participant, as the case may be, or by the
Owner Participant or the Lessor, as the case may be, to the Lessee, that it
desires to obtain an appraisal with respect to such amount, value or period. If
required by the terms of the applicable Operative Documents, such parties shall
first attempt to agree on such matter. If such parties are unable to agree on
such matter within the time period specified in the applicable Operative
Document, or if such parties are not required to attempt to agree, such parties
shall thereupon consult for the purpose of selecting a mutually acceptable
Independent appraiser. If within 10 days from the date the parties are required
to so consult, they are unable to agree upon the appointment of a mutually
acceptable Independent appraiser, then each of such parties shall appoint an
Independent appraiser, and such Independent appraisers shall jointly determine
such matter. If one party does not so appoint an Independent appraiser, then the
Independent appraiser appointed by the other shall determine such matter as the
sole appraiser. If such two Independent appraisers cannot agree on such matter
within 20 days, such matters shall be determined by such two Independent
appraisers and a third Independent appraiser chosen within 10 days after such
20-day period by such two Independent appraisers or, if such three Independent
appraisers fail to reach an agreement, the determination of the appraiser that
differs most from the second highest determination shall be excluded (unless
such difference is less than ten percent from either of the other
determinations), the remaining two determinations shall be averaged (or all
three shall be averaged, if the third determination is not discarded due to the
preceding parenthetical) and such average shall constitute the determination of
the appraisers. If such two Independent appraisers fail to agree upon the
appointment of a third Independent appraiser within the allotted time period,
such appointment shall be made by the New York City office of the American
Arbitration Association or any organization successor thereto, upon the request
of any such parties from a panel of arbitrators having familiarity with assets
similar to the assets comprised by the Production System. The determination of
the appraisers so chosen shall be given within 20 days of the appointment of
such third appraiser, and, to the extent such determination relates to the
calculation of the Fair Market Rental Value or Fair Market Sales Value under the
Lease, the appraisers shall, in making such determination, apply methodologies
consistent (after taking into account then current facts and circumstances) with
those applied in connection with the Final Appraisal. Fees and expenses of the
appraisers appointed in connection with an Appraisal Procedure shall be paid by
the Lessee, except that if the Appraisal Procedure is utilized in connection
with the actual purchase by the Lessee of the Undivided Interest pursuant to
Section 6.1(a) of the Lease or in



                                      A-4

         WHEREAS, upon adoption of this Plan, the Board terminated the 1993 Plan
effective as of December 31, 2002;

         WHEREAS, notwithstanding such termination of the 1993 Plan, Awards will
still be granted for the Performance Period that ended on December 31, 2002
pursuant to and in accordance with the 1993 Plan;

         WHEREAS, except as specifically provided in this Plan, such termination
of the 1993 Plan will have no effect on unpaid Deferred Incentive Compensation
Awards (as defined in, and granted pursuant to, the 1993 Plan), which Awards
will continue to be governed by the terms of the 1993 Plan; and

         WHEREAS, in considering the termination of the 1993 Plan and the
adoption of this Plan, the Board took into account the value of the overriding
royalty interests dedicated to the Employee Incentive Override Pool (as defined
in the 1993 Plan) under the 1993 Plan from and after the date of termination of
the 1993 Plan and determined that such value has been incorporated into this
Plan;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for the purpose
described below, the Board has adopted, effective as of the date first written
above, the terms and provisions governing this Plan as follows:

                                       I.
                                     PURPOSE

         This Plan is intended to provide a means whereby employees of the

involvement in the development and financial success of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries, to attract and retain employees of outstanding
competence and ability and to encourage them to remain with and devote their
best efforts to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to reward
such employees for outstanding performance, thereby advancing the interests of
the Company and its stockholders.

<PAGE>
                  (vi) in the discretion of the Committee, the amount (or any
portion thereof) by which the aggregate amount of Awards granted with respect to
any previous Performance Period exceeded the amount of the Redetermined
Incentive Pool for such Performance Period, but only if any such amount has not
previously reduced an Incentive Pool pursuant to this clause (vi).

         (b) As soon as administratively feasible after the end of a Performance
Period, the Committee shall determine the amount of the Incentive Pool with
respect to such Performance Period. If the financial information for such
Performance Period is not final at the time that the Committee meets to
determine the amount of the Incentive Pool, the Committee may use the then best
available estimates of such financial information to determine the amount of the
Incentive Pool. Such determination shall be in writing and shall be filed with
the appropriate records of the Company.

                                       V.
                                 GRANT OF AWARDS

         (a) Subject to Article VIII(a), the aggregate amount of Awards granted
to Eligible Employees with respect to a particular Performance Period shall be
equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of the Incentive Pool for such Performance
Period and (ii) an amount recommended by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company that is no less than 85% of the amount of the Incentive Pool for such
Performance Period.

         (b) At any time and from time to time after the determination of the
Incentive Pool with respect to a Performance Period and prior to the February 28
following the end of the such Performance Period, the Committee shall grant
Awards to those Eligible Employees that the Committee, in its discretion,
determines should receive Awards. Subject to paragraph (a) above, the amount of
such Awards shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion. The
Committee shall consider the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company in making such determinations.

         (c) Each Award shall be designated as a Current Award or a Deferred
Award. An Eligible Employee may be granted both a Current Award and a Deferred
Award with respect to a single Performance Period.

         (a) The Company shall maintain a separate Deferred Award Account for
each employee who has been granted a Deferred Award under this Plan. If an
employee receives more than one Deferred Award, a separate Deferred Award
Account shall be maintained for each Award. An employee's Deferred Award Account
shall be debited and credited as provided in this Article VI and in Article VII.

         (b) Promptly after the determination by the Committee of the amount of
any Deferred Award to an Eligible Employee, there shall be credited to the
Deferred Award Account of such employee the amount of such award.

                                       5
<PAGE>
         (c) The balance in each Deferred Award Account shall accrue interest,
beginning on the March 1 following the Performance Period for which the related
Deferred Award was granted and continuing for so long as any balance remains in
such Deferred Award Account, at the Designated Rate from time to time in effect.
Interest shall be computed on a daily basis using a 365 or 366 day year, as the
case may be, applied to the balance in such Deferred Award Account. Interest
shall be credited to Deferred Award Accounts as of November 30 of each year
unless otherwise provided by this Plan.

                                      VII.
                           PAYMENT OF DEFERRED AWARDS

         (a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, each Deferred Award shall be paid
in four annual installments, with each installment consisting of 25% of such
Deferred Award plus interest credited to the applicable Deferred Award Account
with respect to such amount. The first installment shall be paid on the next
December 1 following the end of the Performance Period with respect to which the
Award was granted (the "FIRST INSTALLMENT DATE"). The second, third and fourth
installments shall be paid on the first, second and third anniversaries,
respectively, of the First Installment Date. The applicable Deferred Award
Account shall be debited for all amounts paid pursuant to this paragraph (a).

         (b) If an employee terminates employment with the Company or any
Subsidiary prior to receiving payment of all Deferred Awards granted to such
employee (together with any interest credited with respect thereto), the
following provisions shall govern the payment or forfeiture of such amounts:

                  (i) Each Grandfathered Employee who voluntary terminates
employment or who is involuntarily terminated other than for Cause shall be
vested in the full amount (including interest to the date of payment) remaining,
if any, in all Deferred Award Accounts for such employee at the time of such
employee's termination of employment.

                  (ii) Each Retiring Employee shall be vested in the full amount
(including interest to the date of payment) remaining, if any, in all Deferred
Award Accounts at the time of such employee's retirement.

                  (iii) Unless otherwise expressly provided by the Committee,
each employee who (A) is not a Grandfathered Employee or a Retiring Employee who
terminates employment with the Company or any Subsidiary for any reason other
than death or permanent disability or (B) is a Grandfathered Employee who is
involuntarily terminated for Cause shall forfeit any and all Deferred Awards
remaining to be paid to such employee under this Plan and any credited but
unpaid interest in any Deferred Award Account for such employee and such
employee shall not be entitled to receive any further payments under this Plan.

                  (iv) If an employee's employment with the Company or any
Subsidiary terminates by reason of such employee's death or permanent
disability, the Company shall pay to the estate of such employee or to such
employee, as the case may be, the full amount (including interest to the date of
payment of such amount) remaining, if any, in all Deferred Award Accounts for
such employee at the time of such employee's death or permanent disability. Such

                                       6
<PAGE>
payment shall be made within 90 days after the Company is notified of such
employee's death or permanent disability.

                  (v) If a former employee dies while still eligible to receive
payment for Deferred Awards, the Company shall pay to the estate of such former
employee the full amount (including interest to the date of payment of such
amount) remaining, if any, in all Deferred Award Accounts for such employee at
the time of such employee's death. Such payment shall be made within 90 days
after the Company is notified of such employee's death.

                  (vi) A leave of absence authorized by the Company or any
Subsidiary shall not be considered a termination of employment for purposes of
this Article VII or the definition of Grandfathered Employee.

                  (vii) All affected Deferred Award accounts shall be debited
for all amounts paid or forfeited pursuant to this paragraph (b).

                  (viii) Any amount remaining in any Deferred Award Account for
a former employee not forfeited pursuant to clause (iii) above shall be paid no
later than the time that such amount would have been paid pursuant to paragraph
(a) above but may, at the option of the Company, be paid (together with interest
to the date of payment) earlier.

         (c) All amounts (including interest to the date of payment of such
amounts) remaining, if any, in each Deferred Award Account at the time of a
Change of Control shall (i) automatically vest, (ii) not be subject to
forfeiture pursuant to paragraph (b) above and (iii) be paid to the employee to
which each such Deferred Award Account relates at the time of such Change of
Control.

         (d) An employee may provide the Company with a written designation of a
beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any payments of Awards that would
otherwise be paid to such employee's estate hereunder. Any such designation may
be changed or revoked by written notice to the Company.

                                     VIII.
                       DURATION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

         (a) The Board shall have the right to amend this Plan from time to
time, to terminate it entirely or to direct the discontinuance of Awards either
temporarily or permanently. However, no amendment, discontinuance or termination
of this Plan shall operate to annul an Award that has already been made to an
employee unless otherwise provided by the terms of this Plan. The term of this
Plan shall be from its Effective Date until terminated by the Board.

         (b) In furtherance, and not in limitation, of paragraph (a) above, in
contemplation of or upon a Change of Control or at any other time determined by
the Board, this Plan may be restructured or converted into a severance or other
plan and such restructured or converted plan may, among any other alterations or
changes determined by the Board in its sole discretion, (i) alter the
eligibility requirements for awards under such plan, (ii) provide for a
Performance Period that is shorter or longer, (iii) change the provisions
regarding the forfeiture of Deferred Awards, (iv) change the definition of
Adjusted Net Income, (v) change the percentage of

                                       7
<PAGE>
Adjusted Net Income included in the Incentive Pool or (vi) provide that less
than all of the Incentive Pool must be paid in Awards to Eligible Employees.

                                      IX.
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         (a) Neither this Plan nor any grant of Awards under this Plan shall
confer on any employee the right to continued employment by the Company or any
Subsidiary, or affect in any way the right of the Company or such Subsidiary to
terminate the employment of such employee at any time. Any question as to
whether and when there has been a termination of an employee's employment and
the cause of such termination shall be determined by the Committee, and its
determination shall be final.

         (b) Except to the extent set forth herein as to the rights of the
estates or beneficiaries of employees to receive payments, Awards under this
Plan are non-assignable and non-transferable and are not subject to
anticipation, adjustment, alienation, encumbrance, garnishment, attachment or
levy of any kind.

         (c) None of the establishment of this Plan, the granting of Awards or
the establishment of Deferred Award Accounts shall be deemed to create a trust.
This Plan and all unpaid awards shall constitute an unfunded, unsecured
liability of the Company to make payments in accordance with the provisions of
this Plan, and no person or entity shall have any security or other interest in
any assets of the Company, in any Deferred Award Account or otherwise.

         (d) The existence of this Plan and the Awards granted hereunder shall
not affect in any way the right or power of the Board or the stockholders of the
Company to authorize or consummate any merger or consolidation of the Company,
the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any sale, lease, exchange or
other disposition of all or any part of its assets or business or any other
corporate act or proceeding.

         (e) Neither the officers nor the directors of the Company nor the
members of the Committee shall under any circumstances have any liability with
respect to this Plan or its administration except for gross and intentional
malfeasance. The officers and directors of the Company and the members of the
Committee may rely upon opinions of counsel as to all matters, including the
creation, operation and interpretation of this Plan.

         (f) No portion of this Plan shall be effective at any time when such
portion violates an applicable state or federal law, regulation or governmental
order or directive which is subject to sanctions, whether direct or indirect.
