Item 1. Business.

                                  THE COMPANY



      The Company is a diversified financial services holding company
principally engaged in personal and commercial lines of property and casualty
insurance, banking and lending, manufacturing and real estate activities. The
Company concentrates on return on investment and cash flow to build long-term
shareholder value, rather than emphasizing volume or market share. Additionally,
the Company continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing
operations and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to
maximize shareholder value.

      Shareholders' equity has grown from a deficit of $7,657,000 at December
31, 1978 (prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Company by
the Company's Chairman and President), to a positive shareholders' equity of
$1,853,159,000 at December 31, 1998, equal to a book value per common share of
the Company (a "Common Share") of negative $.11 at December 31, 1978 and $29.90
at December 31, 1998.

      In 1998, the Company announced that it was considering the payment of a
significant cash dividend. The Company has received a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service providing that any gain realized on such a dividend (up to a
maximum of approximately $812,000,000) would be treated as a capital gain. The
Company anticipates that, prior to the date of its 1999 Annual Meeting scheduled
for May 5, 1999, its Board of Directors will declare a dividend in an aggregate
amount of approximately $812,000,000, minus amounts paid to repurchase Common
Shares from March 17, 1999 through the date of declaration. Payment of such
dividend would require the Company to make an offer to purchase all of its
outstanding 8-1/4% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2005 and its 7-7/8% Senior
Subordinated Debentures due 2006, outstanding in the aggregate principal amount
of $235,000,000, at a purchase price of 101% of principal, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing these
Debentures. These offers would be required to be made within five business days
after the payment of such dividend, unless the terms of the Debentures can be
modified on terms that are acceptable to the Company.

      As of December 31, 1998, the Company owned a 30% interest in Caja de
Ahorro y Seguro S.A. ("Caja"), a holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged
in property and casualty insurance, life insurance, workers' compensation
insurance and banking in Argentina. During 1998, the Company's previously
announced agreement to sell substantially all of its interest in Caja to its
Argentine partner was restructured. In March 1999, the Company sold all of its
interest in Caja to Assicurazioni Generali Group, an Italian insurance company,
for $126,000,000 in cash and a $40,000,000 collateralized note maturing April
2001 from its Argentine partner. The Company will record a pre-tax gain of
approximately $120,000,000 in its first quarter 1999 results of operations in
connection with this transaction.

      In February 1999, the Company sold its entire interest in its Russian
joint venture to its joint venture partner, PepsiCo, Inc. for consideration of
approximately $39,190,000. Although the Company will recognize a pre-tax gain of
approximately $29,545,000 in the first quarter 1999 results of operations, when
combined with the Company's share of the joint venture's losses since inception,
the Company's net loss from this investment is approximately $40,310,000. For
more information concerning this transaction, see Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of
this Report.

      In February 1999, the Company sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Sperry
and Hutchinson Company, Inc. (through which the Company had conducted a trading
stamps business) and will reflect a pre-tax gain of approximately $19,000,000 in
its first quarter 1999 results of operations.


<PAGE>
      In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company acquired a 95.4% interest in
Fidei S.A., a French company listed on the Paris Stock Exchange that is engaged
directly and through subsidiaries in real estate activities, for approximately
$62,300,000. In connection with this acquisition, the Company entered into
currency swap agreements to hedge approximately $55,000,000 of its foreign
currency exposure.

      In September 1998, the Company reinsured substantially all of its life
insurance business to Allstate Life Insurance Company ("Allstate") and a
subsidiary thereof in an indemnity reinsurance transaction (the "Reinsurance
Transaction"). In December 1998, the Company agreed to sell its life insurance
subsidiaries, Charter National Life Insurance Company ("Charter") and
Intramerica Life Insurance Company ("Intramerica"), to Allstate. Consummation of
this transaction, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 1999, is
subject to regulatory approval and the satisfaction of certain other conditions.
The transaction is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of approximately
$20,000,000, principally resulting from the recognition of deferred gains from
prior reinsurance transactions. The consolidated financial statements of the
Company included in this Report reflect the life insurance operations as
discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements for prior
periods have been restated to be consistent with such presentation.

      In 1998, the Company declared a special pro rata dividend to shareholders
of record on August 25, 1998 relating to the stock of HomeFed Corporation
("HomeFed"), a publicly held real estate development company. For additional
information concerning this dividend, see Item 5, "Market for Registrant's
Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters" of this Report.

      The Company's insurance operations consist of personal and commercial
property and casualty insurance primarily conducted through Empire Insurance
Company ("Empire") and Allcity Insurance Company ("Allcity"). For the year ended
December 31, 1998, these insurance operations accounted for 57% of the Company's
revenues from continuing operations and at December 31, 1998, 25% of the
Company's assets.

      The Company's insurance operations have a diversified investment portfolio
of securities, of which approximately 84% are issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
Treasury or by U.S. governmental agencies or are rated "investment grade" by
Moody's Investors Service Inc. ("Moody's") and/or Standard & Poor's Corporation
("S&P").

      The Company's banking and lending operations principally consist of making
instalment loans to niche markets primarily funded by customer banking deposits
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The Company's
principal lending activities consist of providing collateralized personal
automobile loans to individuals with poor credit histories.

      The Company's manufacturing operations manufacture and market plastic
netting used for a variety of purposes including, among other things,
construction, agriculture, packaging, carpet padding and filtration.

      The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have tax loss carryforwards.
The amount and availability of the tax loss carryforwards are subject to certain
qualifications, limitations and uncertainties as more fully discussed in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

      As used herein, the term "Company" refers to Leucadia National
Corporation, a New York corporation organized in 1968, and its subsidiaries,
except as the context otherwise may require.

                 FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

      In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information"
("SFAS 131"), which requires a "management" approach for segment disclosure. The
management approach designates the internal organization that is used by
management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
source of the Company's reportable segments. SFAS 131 also requires disclosures
about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company's
reportable segments consist of its operating units, which offer different
products and services and are managed separately. These reportable segments are:
property and casualty insurance, banking and lending, manufacturing and other
operations. The property and casualty insurance operations provide personal and
commercial lines of insurance primarily to niche markets in the New York
metropolitan area. The banking and lending operations principally make
collateralized personal automobile instalment loans to individuals who have
difficulty obtaining credit, at interest rates above those charged to
individuals with good credit histories. Such loans are primarily funded by
deposits insured by the FDIC. The manufacturing operations manufacture and
market proprietary plastic netting used for a variety of purposes. Other
operations primarily consist of real estate activities. Associated companies
consists of entities which the Company does not control but has the ability to
exercise significant influence over and which are accounted for on the equity
method of accounting. The information in the following tables for corporate
assets primarily consists of investments, notes receivable from the sale of
certain businesses and cash and cash equivalents. Corporate revenues primarily
consist of investment income on the above corporate assets. Corporate assets,
revenues, overhead expenses and interest expense are not allocated to the
operating units. The Company's business is conducted principally in the United
States; foreign operations and investments have not been material.

      Certain information concerning the Company's segments for 1998, 1997 and
1996 is presented in the following table.

                         PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

General

      The Company's principal property and casualty insurance operations are
conducted through the Empire Group, which consists of Empire and Allcity. The
Empire Group specializes in personal and commercial property and casualty
insurance business primarily in the New York metropolitan area. The Empire Group
provides personal automobile and homeowners insurance and commercial insurance
coverage for vehicles (including medallion and radio-controlled livery
vehicles), multi-family residential real estate, workers' compensation and
various other business classes. The Empire Group is rated "B+" (very good) by
A.M. Best Company ("Best") and rated "BBB+" (good) by S&P. As with all ratings,
Best and S&P ratings are subject to change at any time.

      In 1998, a new president and chief executive officer was named at the
Empire Group and, effective in 1999, the business was reorganized into three
divisions: the Small Business Division, the Personal Lines and Residual Market
Division, and the Mid-Market Division. Each of these divisions has separate
management teams responsible for all marketing, sales and underwriting decisions
within their divisions. The reorganization is designed to provide a greater
degree of accountability for underwriting results and to create a closer
relationship with agents and customers of the Empire Group. The Small Business
Division will primarily focus on commercial package products for small
businesses; the Personal Lines and Residual Market Division will primarily
concentrate on personal automobile and homeowners insurance; and the Mid-Market
Division will focus on commercial auto, commercial package and workers'
compensation insurance for larger accounts.

      For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, net earned premiums
for the Empire Group were $228,600,000, $275,000,000 and $326,400,000,
respectively. The decline in the Empire Group's net earned premiums is primarily
due to the continuing reduction in the assigned risk business and reductions in
certain commercial lines. During the year ended December 31, 1998, approximately
56%, 30% and 14% of net earned premiums of the Empire Group were derived from
personal and commercial automobile lines, other commercial lines and other
personal lines, respectively. Substantially all of the Empire Group's policies
are written in New York for a one-year period. The Empire Group is licensed in
New York to write most lines of insurance that may be written by a property and
casualty insurer. The Empire Group is also licensed to write insurance in
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire and New Jersey.

      The voluntary business of the Empire Group is produced through general
agents, local agents and insurance brokers, who are compensated for their
services by payment of commissions on the premiums they generate. There are
seven general agents, one of which is owned by Empire, and approximately 379
local agents and insurance brokers presently acting under agreements with the
Empire Group. These agents and brokers also represent other competing insurance
companies. The Empire Group's owned general agent is its largest producer and
generated approximately 12% of its total premium volume for the year ended
December 31, 1998.

      The Empire Group has acquired blocks of assigned risk business from other
insurance companies (the "service business") relating to private passenger and
commercial automobile insurance. These contractual arrangements, which are
negotiated for one or two year periods, provide for fees paid to the Empire
Group within parameters established by the New York Insurance Department.

      On a quarterly basis, the Empire Group reviews and adjusts its estimated
loss reserves for any changes in trends and actual loss experience. Included in
the Empire Group's results for 1998 was approximately $42,000,000 for reserve
strengthening related to losses from prior accident years. The Empire Group will



                                     5
<PAGE>
continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves and record future
adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate. Beginning in 1996, the Empire
Group has taken certain steps to improve its operations, including systems
enhancements and actions relating to pricing and improved underwriting and
claims handling; these efforts have continued into 1999. In addition, the Empire
Group may initiate additional changes in the future. The Company believes that
the results of these efforts taken to date will not be known for some time,
given the nature of the property and casualty insurance business and the
inherently long period of time involved in settling claims.

      Set forth below is certain statistical information for the Empire Group
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
and statutory accounting principles ("SAP"). The Loss Ratio is the ratio of net
incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to net premiums earned. The Expense
Ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses (policy acquisition costs,
commissions, and a portion of administrative, general and other expenses
attributable to underwriting operations) to net premiums written, if determined
in accordance with SAP, or to net premiums earned, if determined in accordance
with GAAP. A Combined Ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit and a
Combined Ratio above 100% indicates an underwriting loss. The Combined Ratio
does not include the effect of investment income.

      Industry Combined Ratios may not be fully comparable as a result of, among
      other things, differences in geographical concentration and in the mix of
      property and casualty insurance products.

(b)   For 1998, the difference in the accounting treatment for curtailment
      gains relating to defined benefit pension plans was the principal reason
      for the difference between the GAAP Combined Ratio and the SAP Combined
      Ratio.  For 1996, a change in the statutory accounting treatment for
      retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements was the principal reason
      for the difference between the GAAP Combined Ratio and the SAP Combined
      Ratio.  Additionally for all three years, the difference relates to the
      accounting for certain costs which are treated differently under SAP and
      GAAP.  For further information about the Empire Group's Combined Ratios,
      see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

      Liabilities for unpaid losses, which are not discounted (except for
certain workers' compensation liabilities), and loss adjustment expenses ("LAE")
are determined using case-basis evaluations, statistical analyses and estimates
for salvage and subrogation recoverable and represent estimates of the ultimate
claim costs of all unpaid losses and LAE. Liabilities include a provision for
losses that have occurred but have not yet been reported. These estimates are
subject to the effect of trends in future claim severity and frequency
experience. Adjustments to such estimates are made from time to time due to
changes in such trends as well as changes in actual loss experience. These
adjustments are reflected in current earnings.

      The Empire Group relies upon standard actuarial ultimate loss projection
techniques to obtain estimates of liabilities for losses and LAE. These
projections include the extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by
business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation
and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon historical
patterns. In addition, methods based upon average loss costs, reported claim
counts and pure premiums are reviewed in order to obtain a range of estimates
for setting the reserve levels. For further input, changes in operations in
pertinent areas including underwriting standards, product mix, claims management
and legal climate are periodically reviewed.

      In the following table, the liability for losses and LAE of the Empire
Group is reconciled for each of the three years ended December 31, 1998.
Included therein are current year data and prior year development.

      The following table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities
from 1988 through 1998 for the Empire Group. The liability line at the top of
the table indicates the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded
as of the dates indicated. The middle section of the table shows the
re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as
of the end of each succeeding year. As more information becomes available and
claims are settled, the estimated liabilities are adjusted upward or downward
with the effect of decreasing or increasing net income at the time of
adjustment. The lower section of the table shows the cumulative amount paid with
respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding
year.

      The "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" represents the aggregate change
in the estimates over all prior years. For example, the initial 1988 liability
estimate indicated on the table of $222,814,000 has been



                                        8
<PAGE>
re-estimated during the course of the succeeding ten years, resulting in a
re-estimated liability at December 31, 1998 of $210,837,000, or a redundancy of
$11,977,000. If the re-estimated liability exceeded the liability initially
established, a cumulative deficiency would be indicated.

      In evaluating this information, it should be noted that each amount shown
for "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" includes the effects of all changes in
amounts for prior periods. For example, the amount of the redundancy
(deficiency) related to losses settled in 1992, but incurred in 1988, will be
included in the cumulative redundancy (deficiency) amount for 1988, 1989, 1990
and 1991. This table is not intended to and does not present accident or policy
year loss and LAE development data. Conditions and trends that have affected
development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the
future. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to extrapolate future
redundancies or deficiencies based on these tables.

see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" of this Report.

Investments

      Investment activities represent a significant part of the Company's
insurance related revenues and profitability. Investments are managed by the
Company's investment advisors under the direction of, and upon consultation
with, the Company's investment committees.

      The Company's insurance subsidiaries have a diversified investment
portfolio of securities, substantially all of which are rated "investment grade"
by Moody's and/or S&P or issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by
governmental agencies. The Company's insurance subsidiaries do not generally
invest in less than "investment grade" or "non-rated" securities, real estate or
mortgages, although from time to time they may make such investments in amounts
not expected to be material.

      The composition of the Company's insurance subsidiaries' investment
portfolio as of December 31, 1998 and 1997 was as follows:

                                                   1998         1997

Reinsurance

      The Empire Group's maximum retained limit was $500,000 for workers'
compensation; for other property and casualty lines, the Empire Group's maximum
retained limit was $300,000 for 1998, 1997 and 1996. Additionally, the Empire
Group has entered into certain excess of loss and catastrophe treaties to
protect against certain losses. The Empire Group's retention of lower level
losses in such treaties is $7,500,000 for 1999, and was $7,500,000 for 1998,
$5,000,000 for 1997 and $3,000,000 for 1996.

      Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its
primary liability for the full amount of the policy liability, it does make the
assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded.
The Company's reinsurance generally has been placed with certain of the largest
reinsurance companies, including (with their respective Best ratings) American
Re-Insurance Company (A++), General Reinsurance Corporation (A++) and Zurich
Reinsurance (North America), Inc. (A). The Company has reinsured substantially
all of its discontinued life insurance operations pursuant to the Reinsurance
Transaction with Allstate and certain other transactions. As mentioned above,
the Company has agreed to sell its remaining life insurance subsidiaries to
Allstate, and expects to close this sale in the second quarter of 1999. The
Company believes its reinsurers to be financially capable of meeting their
respective obligations. However, to the extent that any reinsuring company is
unable to meet its



                                     11
<PAGE>
obligations, the Company's insurance subsidiaries would be liable for the
reinsured risks. The Company has established reserves, which the Company
believes are adequate, for any nonrecoverable reinsurance.

Competition

      The insurance industry is a highly competitive industry, in which many of
the Company's competitors have substantially greater financial resources, larger
sales forces, more widespread agency and broker relationships, and more
diversified lines of insurance coverage. Additionally, certain competitors
market their products with endorsements from affinity groups, while the
Company's products are unendorsed, which may give these other companies a
competitive advantage. Federal administrative, legislative and judicial activity
may result in changes to federal banking laws that increase the ability of
national banks to offer insurance products in direct competition with the
Company. The Company is unable to determine what effect, if any, such changes
may have on the Company's operations.

      The Company believes that property and casualty insurers generally compete
on the basis of price, customer service, consumer recognition, product design,
product mix and financial stability. The industry has historically been cyclical
in nature, with periods of less intense price competition generating significant
profits, followed by periods of increased price competition resulting in reduced
profitability or loss. The current cycle of intense price competition has
continued for a longer period than in the past, suggesting that the significant
infusion of capital into the industry in recent years, coupled with larger
investment returns has been, and may continue to be, a depressing influence on
policy rates. In addition, the Company is experiencing increased competition
from low cost insurance providers that write personal lines business on a direct
response basis through direct mail and telemarketing. The profitability of the
property and casualty insurance industry is affected by many factors, including
rate competition, severity and frequency of claims (including catastrophe
losses), interest rates, state regulation, court decisions and judicial climate,
all of which are outside the Company's control.

Government Regulation

      Insurance companies are subject to detailed regulation and supervision in
the states in which they transact business. Such regulation pertains to matters
such as approving policy forms and various premium rates, minimum reserves and
loss ratio requirements, the type and amount of investments, minimum capital and
surplus requirements, granting and revoking licenses to transact business,
levels of operations and regulating trade practices. Insurance companies are
required to file detailed annual reports with the supervisory agencies in each
of the states in which they do business, and are subject to examination by such
agencies at any time. Increased regulation of insurance companies at the state
level and new regulation at the federal level is possible, although the Company
cannot predict the nature or extent of any such regulation or what impact it
would have on the Company's operations.

      The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has adopted
model laws incorporating the concept of a "risk based capital" ("RBC")
requirement for insurance companies. Generally, the RBC formula is designed to
measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory capital in relation to the risks
inherent in its business. The RBC formula is used by the states as an early
warning tool to identify weakly capitalized companies for the purpose of
initiating regulatory action. The Company's continuing insurance operations' RBC
ratio as of December 31, 1998 exceeded minimum requirements. The NAIC also has
adopted various ratios for insurance companies which, in addition to the RBC
ratio, are designed to serve as a tool to assist state regulators in discovering
potential weakly capitalized companies or companies with unusual trends. While
the Company's continuing insurance operations had certain "other than normal"
NAIC ratios for the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company believes that
there are no material underlying problems or weaknesses in its insurance
operations and that it is unlikely that material adverse regulatory action will
be taken.




                                     12
<PAGE>
      The Company's insurance subsidiaries are members of state insurance funds
which provide certain protection to policyholders of insolvent insurers doing
business in those states. Due to insolvencies of certain insurers in recent
years, the Company's insurance subsidiaries have been assessed certain amounts
which have not been material and are likely to be assessed additional amounts by
state insurance funds. The Company believes that it has provided for all
anticipated assessments and that any additional assessments will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of
operations.

                              BANKING AND LENDING

      The Company's banking and lending operations principally are conducted
through American Investment Bank, N.A. ("AIB"), a national bank subsidiary, and
American Investment Financial ("AIF"), an industrial loan corporation. AIB and
AIF take money market and other non-demand deposits that are eligible for
insurance provided by the FDIC. AIB and AIF had deposits of $189,782,000 and
$198,582,000 at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. AIB and AIF currently
have several deposit-taking and lending facilities in the Salt Lake City area.
The funds generated by the deposits are primarily used to fund consumer
instalment loans.

      The Company's consolidated banking and lending operations had outstanding
loans (net of unearned finance charges) of $185,183,000 and $202,938,000 at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. At December 31, 1998, 76% were loans
to individuals generally collateralized by automobiles; 12% were instalment
loans to consumers, substantially all of which were collateralized by real or
personal property; 5% were unsecured loans to individuals acquired from others
in connection with investments in limited partnerships; 4% were unsecured loans
to executives and professionals, generally with good credit histories; and 3%
were loans to small businesses.

      It is the Company's policy to charge to income an allowance for losses
which, based upon management's analysis of numerous factors, including current
economic trends, aging of the loan portfolio and historical loss experience, is
deemed adequate to cover reasonably expected losses on outstanding loans. At
December 31, 1998, the allowance for loan losses for the Company's entire loan
portfolio was $9,398,000 or 5.1% of the net outstanding loans, compared to
$10,199,000 or 5% of net outstanding loans at December 31, 1997.

      Collateralized personal automobile instalment loans are made to
individuals who have difficulty obtaining credit, at interest rates above those
charged to individuals with good credit histories. In determining which
individuals qualify for these loans, the Company takes into account a number of
highly selective criteria with respect to the individual as well as the
collateral to attempt to minimize the number of defaults. Additionally, the
Company closely monitors these loans and takes prompt possession of the
collateral in the event of a default. For the three year period ended December
31, 1998, the Company generated $146,085,000 of these loans ($72,848,000 during
1998). Due in part to the recent failures of some of the Company's competitors,
the Company has been able to increase its new loan volume at acceptable risk
levels. In addition, during 1998 the Company purchased a $36,900,000 portfolio
of such loans. The Company intends to continue to acquire additional portfolios
of such loans that meet the Company's underwriting standards if they can be
purchased on attractive terms. During 1998, AIB and AIF sold substantially all
of their executive and professional loan portfolios for aggregate proceeds of
$89,500,000.

      The Company's banking and lending operations compete with banks, savings
and loan associations, credit unions, credit card issuers and consumer finance
companies, many of which are able to offer financial services on very
competitive terms. Additionally, substantial national financial services
networks have been formed by major brokerage firms, insurance companies,
retailers and bank holding companies. Some competitors have substantial local
market positions; others are part of large, diversified organizations.




                                     13
<PAGE>
      The Company's principal banking and lending operations are subject to
detailed supervision by state authorities, as well as federal regulation
pursuant to the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and regulations
promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission. The Company's banking operations
are subject to federal and state regulation and supervision by, among others,
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), the FDIC and the
State of Utah. AIB's primary federal regulator is the OCC, while the primary
federal regulator for AIF is the FDIC.

      The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 ("CEBA") places certain
restrictions on the operations of AIB and restricts further acquisitions of
banks and savings institutions by the Company. CEBA does not restrict AIF as
currently operated.

                                 MANUFACTURING

      Through its plastics division, the Company manufactures and markets
proprietary plastic netting used for a variety of purposes including, among
other things, construction, agriculture, packaging, carpet padding and
filtration. The plastics division markets its products both domestically and
internationally, with approximately 13% of its 1998 sales exported to Europe,
Latin America, Japan and Australia. New product development focuses on niches
where the division's proprietary technology and expertise can lead to
sustainable competitive economic advantages. For the years ended December 31,
1998, 1997 and 1996, the plastics division's revenues were approximately
$56,600,000, $50,900,000 and $47,600,000, respectively.

      The plastics division is subject to domestic and international
competition, generally on the basis of price, service and quality. Additionally,
certain products are dependent on cyclical industries, including the
construction industry. The Company holds patents on certain improvements to the
basic manufacturing processes and on applications thereof. The Company believes
that the expiration of these patents, individually or in the aggregate, is
unlikely to have a material effect on the plastics division.

                               OTHER OPERATIONS

      The Company has a 90% interest in two operating wineries, Pine Ridge
Winery in Napa Valley, California and Archery Summit in the Willamette Valley of
Oregon. Pine Ridge, which was acquired in 1991, has been an operating winery
since 1981, while Archery Summit was started by the Company in 1993. These
wineries produce and sell super-ultra-premium wines. During 1998, the wineries
sold approximately 62,000 9-liter equivalent cases of wine generating revenues
of approximately $8,987,000. Since acquisition, the Company's investment in
winery operations has grown, principally to fund the Company's acquisition of
land for vineyard development and to increase production capacity and storage
facilities at both of the wineries. It can take up to five years for a new
vineyard property to reach full production and, depending upon the varietal
produced, up to an additional two years before the wine can be sold. At December
31, 1998, the Company's combined investment in these wineries was approximately
$49,000,000.

      At December 31, 1998, the carrying value of the Company's real estate
investments totaled $397,404,000. Of such amount, approximately $245,870,000
consists of real estate assets held by the Company's 95.4% French subsidiary,
Fidei. These assets consisted of 150 buildings (primarily office buildings
located in Paris, France and its environs) totaling more than 3,500,000 square
feet of space. The Company acquired Fidei to maximize its value by marketing all
of its real estate holdings for sale. The remainder of the Company's real estate
investments consist of a variety of domestic projects, some of which are in the
process of development and all of which are available for sale. Included in the
Company's domestic real estate is an office complex located on Capitol Hill in
Washington, D.C. This complex consists of two office buildings with a total of
630,000 square feet of rentable office and retail space and two underground
garages. A comprehensive renovation upgrade to the building is in process. The
D.C. Government has signed a ten year lease for the



                                     14
<PAGE>
space and full occupancy is anticipated in the second quarter of 1999. At
December 31, 1998, the Company's investment in this complex had a carrying value
of $60,200,000.

                               OTHER INVESTMENTS

      The Company owns equity interests representing more than 5% of the
outstanding capital stock of each of the following domestic public companies at
December 31, 1998: Carmike Cinemas, Inc. ("Carmike") (approximately 6% of Class
A shares), GFSI Holdings, Inc. ("GFSI") (approximately 6%), Jordan Industries,
Inc. ("JII") (approximately 10%) , Jordan Telecommunications Products, Inc.
("JTP") (approximately 10%) and MK Gold Company ("MK Gold") (approximately 46%).

      During 1998, the Company's previously announced agreement to sell
substantially all of its interest in Caja to its Argentine partner was
restructured, and in March 1999, the Company sold all of its interest in Caja to
Assicurazioni Generali Group for $126,000,000 in cash and a $40,000,000
collateralized note maturing April 2001 from its Argentine partner. The Company
will record a pre-tax gain of approximately $120,000,000 in its first quarter
1999 results of operations in connection with this transaction.

      A subsidiary of the Company is an owner in The Jordan Company LLC and
Jordan/Zalaznick Capital Company. These entities each specialize in structuring
leveraged buyouts in which the owners are given the opportunity to become equity
participants. Since 1982, the Company has invested an aggregate of $68,021,000
in these entities and related companies and, through December 31, 1998, has
received $104,456,000 (including cash, interest bearing notes and other
receivables) relating to the disposition of investments and management and other
fees. At December 31, 1998, through these entities, the Company had interests in
JII, JTP, Carmike, GFSI and a total of 21 other companies, which in total are
carried in the Company's consolidated financial statements at $27,564,000.

      For further information about the Company's business, reference is made to
Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations," of this Report and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 2. Properties.

      Through its various subsidiaries, the Company owns and utilizes in its
operations two offices in Salt Lake City, Utah used for corporate and banking
and lending activities (totaling approximately 77,000 sq. ft.). In addition, a
subsidiary of the Company owns a facility (totaling approximately 158,500 sq.
ft.) primarily used for manufacturing located in Georgia.

      The Company and its subsidiaries lease numerous manufacturing,
warehousing, office and headquarters facilities. The facilities vary in size and
have leases expiring at various times, subject, in certain instances, to renewal
options. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.


      On May 11, 1994, a shareholder of the Company filed a purported derivative
action entitled Pinnacle Consultants, Ltd. v. Leucadia National Corporation, et
al. (C.A. No. 94 Civ. 3496) against the Company's current Board of Directors and
two former directors, John W. Jordan II and Melvin Hirsch. The action, which was
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
alleged certain Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act, securities
law, conversion and fraud claims. On December 10, 1996, the Second Circuit Court
of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court dismissing these claims.




                                       15
<PAGE>
      On May 13, 1997, Pinnacle filed a purported derivative complaint in New
York State Supreme Court. The action, entitled Pinnacle Consultants, Ltd. v.
Leucadia National Corp., et al. (no. 602470/97), is substantially similar to the
federal court complaint that was dismissed in 1996. Pinnacle has alleged claims
for fraud, waste, breach of fiduciary duty and conversion against the same
current and former Leucadia directors who were named as defendants in the
federal court action. Defendants' motion to dismiss was granted in part and
denied in part. This decision is being appealed to the Appellate Division, First
Department, by Pinnacle and the defendants. The appeal remains sub judice.

      In addition to the foregoing, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties
to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary, routine
litigation incidental to their business or not material to the Company's
consolidated financial position.

      The Company does not believe that any of the foregoing actions will have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or consolidated
results of operations.

      (b)   Holders.

      As of March 12, 1999, there were approximately 3,685 record holders of the
Common Shares.

      (c)   Dividends.

      The Company paid a cash dividend of $.25 per Common Share on December 31,
1997. The payment of dividends in the future is subject to the discretion of the
Board of Directors and will depend upon general business conditions, legal and
contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors that the
Board of Directors may deem to be relevant.

      The HomeFed Dividend. The Company acquired a 41.2% interest in HomeFed in
1995. HomeFed is a publicly traded real estate development company (OTC
(Non-NASDAQ): "HFDC") with its principal office at 1903 Wright Place, Suite 220,
Carlsbad, California 92008 (telephone number 706-918-8200).

      In 1998, the Company distributed to its shareholders of record on August
25, 1998 (the "HomeFed Dividend Holders") a pro rata dividend of all of the
beneficial interests in a trust that holds 41.2% of the common stock of HomeFed
and contracts to increase that ownership to 89.6% of HomeFed. This dividend
resulted in 1998 dividend income to the HomeFed Dividend Holders of $.1426 for
each Common Share of the Company held on August 25, 1998, even though no
physical distribution was made because the trust interests are uncertificated. A
Form 1099-DIV was sent to HomeFed Dividend Holders reflecting this distribution.



                                       18
<PAGE>
      The Company anticipates that, following effectiveness of a registration
statement to be filed with respect to the HomeFed shares, the HomeFed Dividend
Holders will receive 1.0 share of HomeFed common stock for each 1.26 Common
Shares of the Company owned of record on August 25, 1998. The Company expects
that the distribution of HomeFed securities will be made in the third quarter of
1999.

      In connection with the declaration of dividends or the making of
distributions on, or the purchase, redemption or other acquisition of Common
Shares, the Company is required to comply with certain restrictions contained in
certain of its debt instruments. The Company's regulated subsidiaries are
restricted in the amount of distributions that can be made to the Company
without regulatory approval. For further information see Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
included in this Report.

(b)   The Combined Ratio does not reflect the effect of investment income. For
      1998, the difference in the accounting treatment for curtailment gains
      relating to the defined benefit pension plans was the principal reason for
      the difference between the GAAP Combined Ratio and the SAP Combined Ratio.
      For 1996 and 1995, a change in the statutory accounting treatment for
      retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements was the principal reason for
      the difference between the GAAP Combined Ratios and the SAP Combined
      Ratios. Additionally in 1998, 1997 and 1996, the difference relates to the
      accounting for certain costs which are treated differently under SAP and
      GAAP.

(c)   Source: Best's Aggregates & Averages, Property/Casualty, 1998 Edition.
      Industry Combined Ratios may not be fully comparable as a result of, among
      other things, differences in geographical concentration and in the mix of
      property and casualty insurance products.

(d)   Premium to Surplus Ratio was calculated by dividing statutory property and
      casualty insurance premiums written by statutory capital at the end of the

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
         Results of Operations.

      The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's
consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of
operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


Parent Company Liquidity

      Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose
assets principally consist of the stock of its several direct subsidiaries and
cash and liquid investments. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention and
disposition of its existing operations and investigates possible acquisitions of
new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, while the
Parent does not have any material arrangement, commitment or understanding with
respect thereto (except as disclosed in this Report), further acquisitions,
divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible. Its
principal sources of funds are its available cash resources, bank borrowings,
public financings, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its
subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and borrowings
and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries. It has no
substantial recurring cash requirements other than payment of interest and
principal on its debt, tax payments and corporate overhead expenses. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, excluding those amounts held by its regulated subsidiaries and
collateralizing letters of credit, totaled approximately $1,219,000,000. In
addition, the book value of the principal amount of promissory notes received
from Conseco, Inc. upon the 1997 sale of the Colonial Penn Life Group was
$400,000,000 at December 31, 1998.

      In 1998, the Company announced that it was considering the payment of a
significant cash dividend. The Company has received a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service providing that any gain realized on such a dividend (up to a
maximum of approximately $812,000,000) would be treated as a capital gain. The
Company anticipates that, prior to the date of its 1999 Annual Meeting scheduled
for May 5, 1999, its Board of Directors will declare a dividend in an aggregate
amount of approximately $812,000,000, minus amounts paid to repurchase Common
Shares from March 17, 1999 through the date of declaration. Payment of such
dividend would require the Company to make an offer to purchase all of its
outstanding 8-1/4% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2005 and its 7-7/8% Senior
Subordinated Debentures due 2006, outstanding in the aggregate principal amount
of $235,000,000, at a purchase price of 101% of principal, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing these
Debentures. These offers would be required to be made within five business days
after the payment of such dividend, unless the terms of the Debentures can be
modified on terms that are acceptable to the Company.

      Except for the Euro denominated debt of Fidei, which is described below,
the Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and its
non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to certain of its
subsidiaries. These borrowings have primarily been made from banks through
various credit agreement facilities and through public financings. The Company
borrowed $62,300,000 under its $100,000,000 bank credit facility to fund the
purchase price of Fidei, including expenses. In addition, the Company entered
into currency swap agreements to hedge approximately $55,000,000 of its foreign
currency exposure. The counterparties to these currency swap agreements are
major financial institutions, which management believes are able to fulfill
their obligations. The swap agreements mature in tranches in March 2000 and
September 2001. At December 31, 1998, $65,500,000 was outstanding under the bank
credit facility.

      During 1998, the Company's Board of Directors increased to 6,000,000 the
maximum number of its Common Shares that the Company is authorized to purchase.
Through December 31, 1998, the Company repurchased in the open market 1,996,400
Common Shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $58,071,000. From January
1, 1999 through March 12, 1999, the Company acquired 1,738,570 Common Shares for
an aggregate cost of approximately $52,119,000. As a result, as of March 13,
1999, the Company is authorized to repurchase 3,788,717 Common Shares.

      At December 31, 1998, a maximum of approximately $25,200,000 was available
to the Parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiaries without regulatory
approval. Additional amounts may be available to the Parent in the form of loans
or cash advances from regulated subsidiaries, although no amounts were
outstanding at December 31, 1998 or borrowed to date in 1999. There are no
restrictions on distributions from the non-regulated subsidiaries. The Parent
also receives tax sharing payments from subsidiaries included in its
consolidated income tax return, including certain regulated subsidiaries.
Because of the tax loss carryforwards available to the Parent and certain
subsidiaries, together with current interest deductions and corporate expenses,
the amount paid by the Parent for income taxes has been substantially less than
tax sharing payments received from its subsidiaries. Payments from regulated
subsidiaries for dividends, tax sharing payments and other services totaled
approximately $1,295,600,000 (including $1,230,000,000 relating to the sales of
the Colonial Penn companies in 1997) for the year ended December 31, 1998.

      Based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the Company
believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable
conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment
opportunities. Since 1993, the Company's senior debt obligations have been rated
as investment grade by S&P and Duff & Phelps Inc. Ratings issued by bond rating
agencies are subject to change at any time.

Consolidated Liquidity

      In 1998, net cash was used for operations, principally to purchase
investments classified as trading and for the payment of income taxes, partially
offset by the repayment of the Company's bridge financing to PIB, its Russian
joint venture described below. In 1997, net cash was used for operations
principally to fund the Company's capital commitments and bridge financing to
PIB, and for the purchase of investments classified as trading.

      In December 1998, a subsidiary of the Company repurchased for $42,200,000
plus accrued interest, $51,800,000 liquidation amount of 8.65% trust issued
preferred securities of Leucadia Capital Trust I, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company. The difference between the book value and the amount paid was
credited directly to shareholders' equity.

      During 1998, the Company's previously announced agreement to sell
substantially all of its interest in Caja to its Argentine partner was
restructured and, in March 1999, the Company sold all of its interest in Caja to
Assicurazioni Generali Group, an Italian insurance company, for $126,000,000 in
cash and a $40,000,000 collateralized note maturing April 2001 from its
Argentine partner. The Company will record a pre-tax gain of approximately
$120,000,000 in its first quarter 1999 results of operations in connection with
this transaction.

      In September 1998, the Company reinsured, retroactive to January 1, 1998,
substantially all of its remaining life insurance business to Allstate and a
subsidiary thereof in an indemnity reinsurance transaction. While the premium
received on this transaction was approximately $28,675,000, the gain on the
reinsurance transaction was deferred and is being amortized into income based
upon actuarial estimates of the premium revenue of the underlying insurance
contracts. In December 1998, the Company signed an agreement to sell its



                                       23
<PAGE>
remaining life insurance subsidiaries, Charter and Intramerica, to Allstate for
statutory surplus at the date of sale (approximately $62,200,000 at December 31,
1998), plus $3,575,000. The transaction is expected to result in a pre-tax gain
of approximately $20,000,000, principally resulting from recognition of deferred
gains from prior reinsurance transactions (including the September 1998 Allstate
transaction described above). The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals
and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter
of 1999.

      As of December 31, 1998, the Company's consolidated debt was $722,601,000
as compared to $352,872,000 as of December 31, 1997. This increase is primarily
related to the Company's acquisition of 95.4% of Fidei in 1998. At December 31,
1998, the principal amount of Fidei's Euro denominated outstanding debt, all of
which is non-recourse to the Company, was approximately $249,400,000
(approximately 213,656,000 Euros). Inasmuch as Fidei's Euro demoninated assets
will be sold over time and such assets are presently funded with Fidei's Euro
demoninated debt, the Company has determined not to acquire a currency hedge for
Fidei's Euro denominated debt.

      In 1996, the Company formed PIB, a joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., to be
the exclusive bottler and distributor of PepsiCo beverages in a large portion of
central and eastern Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakstan. The Company contributed
$79,500,000 to PIB for a 75% equity interest. Effective as of January 30, 1998,
the Company entered into an agreement with PepsiCo, pursuant to which, among
other things, PIB repaid in full the Company's $77,705,000 bridge financing
(which was funded in 1997) and the Company's equity interest in PIB was reduced
to 37.9%. The agreement relieved the Company of any future funding obligation
with respect to PIB and created an option, exercisable by either the Company or
PepsiCo, pursuant to which PepsiCo was obligated to purchase all of the
Company's interest in PIB (the "Option") for $37,000,000, plus interest. In
February 1999, PepsiCo exercised the Option for approximately $39,190,000,
including interest, and the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately
$29,545,000. However, when combined with the Company's share of the joint
venture losses since inception, the Company's net loss from this investment was
approximately $40,310,000.

      The investment portfolios of the Company's insurance subsidiaries are
principally fixed maturity investments; the balance of their portfolio consists
largely of preferred securities. Of the fixed maturity securities, the majority
consists of those rated "investment grade" or U.S. governmental agency issued or
guaranteed obligations, although limited investments in "non-rated" or rated
less than investment grade securities have been made from time to time.

       Principally as a result of changes in market interest rates during 1998,
the unrealized gain on investments at the end of 1997 of approximately
$5,630,000 (net of taxes) decreased to an unrealized loss of approximately
$982,000 (net of taxes) as of December 31, 1998. While this has resulted in a
decrease in shareholders' equity, it had no effect on results of operations or
cash flows.

      The Company provides collateralized automobile loans to individuals with
poor credit histories. Prior to 1998, the Company's loan volume was in decline
primarily as a result of heavy competition in this line of business. However, in
1998, the Company began to see growth in its automobile lending business as it
expanded into new locations and developed new programs. The Company also
benefited from the decline in competition due to the failure of certain
competitors and a reduction in capital available for securitizations. In
addition, in December 1998, the Company purchased a $36,900,000 sub-prime
automobile portfolio. The Company's investment in automobile loans was
$140,400,000, $77,607,000 and $96,338,000 at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. During 1998, the Company's banking and lending subsidiaries sold
substantially all of their executive and professional loan portfolios for
aggregate proceeds of $89,500,000 and reported a pre-tax gain on these sales of
approximately $6,500,000.




                                       24

      The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have loss carryforwards and
other tax attributes. The amount and availability of tax loss carryforwards are
subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. As described
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, significant additional
amounts of loss carryforwards may be available under certain circumstances. In
order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose
limitations on the use of these carryforwards, the Company's certificate of
incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a
person or entity from accumulating at least five percent of the Common Shares
and the ability of persons or entities now owning at least five percent of the
Common Shares from acquiring additional Common Shares.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Property and Casualty Insurance

      The Company's most significant operation is its insurance business, where
it is a provider of property and casualty insurance primarily in the New York
metropolitan area. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company's insurance
segment contributed 57% of total revenues from continuing operations and, at
December 31, 1998, constituted 25% of total assets.

      Net earned premium revenues of the Empire Group were $228,600,000,
$275,000,000 and $326,400,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively. In 1998, the decrease in earned premium revenues was
primarily due to a decline in the number of assigned risk automobile pool
contracts acquired due to competition and the depopulation of the assigned risk
automobile pools ($24,600,000) and a reduction in certain lines, principally
voluntary commercial automobile ($8,500,000), private passenger automobile
($6,000,000), commercial package policies ($4,300,000) and workers' compensation
($3,700,000), due to tighter underwriting standards, reunderwriting and
increased competition. In 1997, the decline in earned premium revenues was
primarily due to the depopulation of the assigned risk pools ($31,700,000) and a
reduction in certain commercial lines, principally voluntary commercial
automobile ($10,200,000) and workers' compensation ($8,800,000) due to
competition, reunderwriting and repricing. In addition, earned premium revenues
were reduced in 1997 by $5,500,000 to record premiums due under retrospectively
rated reinsurance contracts written for 1995 and prior accident years. The
Empire Group re-estimated the premium due based upon its then current estimate
of loss ratios for 1995 and prior accident years. Partially offsetting these
reductions was an increase in certain voluntary personal lines, principally
private passenger automobile and homeowners.

      The Empire Group's combined ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were
as follows:


                                       Year Ended December 31,
                                       -----------------------
                                     1998       1997        1996
                                     ----       ----        ----

      GAAP                          129.3%     118.5%      114.7%
      SAP                           134.0%     117.8%      107.9%



      The Empire Group's combined ratios increased in 1998 primarily due to the
reduction in premium volume at a rate greater than the reduction in net
underwriting and other costs. In addition, the reduction in servicing fees in
1998 negatively affected the expense ratios. Included in the Empire Group's
results for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were approximately $42,000,000, $27,000,000 and
$28,000,000, respectively, for reserve strengthening related to losses from
prior accident years.




                                       25
<PAGE>
      During 1998, the Empire Group reviewed the adequacy of the reserves
carried for its open claims' files, focusing on workers' compensation,
commercial auto and other commercial liability lines of business. Such reviews
are part of the Empire Group's normal ongoing practice. Particular emphasis
during this review was placed on reserves carried for the workers' compensation
line of business. As part of the review, substantially all open workers'
compensation claim files were reviewed for every accident year up to and
including 1998. The Empire Group also conducted a comprehensive review of
reserves carried for other commercial liability lines of business in which
approximately 28% of the open claim files were reviewed, with a primary focus on
accident years 1995 to 1997. As a result of these reviews, the Empire Group
revised its assumptions regarding average claims costs and probable ultimate
losses and, accordingly, reserves were strengthened by $13,000,000 for workers'
compensation and $14,000,000 for other commercial liability lines of business.
Additionally, during 1998, the Empire Group reorganized the commercial auto
claims department. As part of this realignment, more complex claims files were
reviewed by the most experienced claims examiners and assumptions regarding
average claims severity and probable ultimate losses were revised and reserves
were strengthened by $14,000,000 for commercial automobile lines of business.

      The 1997 reserve strengthening included approximately $11,000,000 for
commercial package lines of business and approximately $7,000,000 for voluntary
commercial automobile lines of business. During 1997, the Empire Group reviewed
the adequacy of the reserves carried for its open claims' files, as part of its
normal ongoing practice, focusing on the commercial package, general liability
and commercial automobile lines of business. As a result of this review and the
continued unfavorable development of prior accident years losses, particularly
the 1992 through 1994 accident years, the Empire Group revised its assumptions
regarding future increases in average claims severity and reserves were
strengthened.

      The 1996 reserve strengthening included approximately $20,000,000, for
voluntary commercial automobile lines of business and approximately $8,000,000
for commercial package lines of business. Beginning in 1992, the Empire Group
entered into new market segments of the voluntary commercial business, including
specialty programs for sanitation trucks, gas stations, fuel oil deliveries and
limousines. Initially, the Empire Group based its loss ratio estimate upon its
experience with similar lines of business, industry statistics and standard
actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques, which consider expected loss
ratios. During 1996, claims began to develop unfavorably and the Empire Group
used such claim development to revise the assumptions that formed the basis of
actuarial studies and reserves were increased. With respect to commercial
package lines, general liability claims for business written in 1992 through
1994 also developed unfavorably. These claims showed an increased frequency of
losses as well as an increase in the time between the date the loss occurred and
when the loss was reported compared to prior experience. General liability
claims are susceptible to the emergence of losses over an extended period of
time.

      For the lines of business discussed above, as well as all other property
and casualty lines of business, the Company employs a variety of standard
actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques, statistical analyses and
case-basis evaluations to estimate its liability for unpaid losses. The
actuarial projections include an extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred
by business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of
inflation and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon
historical patterns. These estimates are performed quarterly and consider any
changes in trends and actual loss experience. Any resulting change in the
estimate of the liability for unpaid losses, including those discussed above, is
reflected in current year earnings during the quarter the change in estimate is
identified.

      The reserving process relies on the basic assumption that past experience
is an appropriate basis for predicting future events. The probable effects of
current developments, trends and other relevant matters are also considered.
Since the establishment of loss reserves is affected by many factors, some of
which are outside the Company's control or affected by future conditions,
reserving for property and casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process
requiring the use of informed estimates and judgements. As additional experience
and



                                       26
<PAGE>
other data become available and are reviewed, the Company's estimates and
judgements may be revised. While the effect of any such changes in estimates
could be material to future results of operations, the Company does not expect
such changes to have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition.

      In management's judgment, information currently available has been
appropriately considered in estimating the Company's loss reserves. The Company
will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves on a quarterly
basis, incorporating any future changes in trends and actual loss experience,
and record adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate.

Manufacturing

      In December 1997, the Company completed the disposition of certain of its
manufacturing operations. As a result, since December 1997, the Company's
manufacturing operations solely have consisted of its plastics division. In
1998, the gross profit for the plastics division increased by 14% to
approximately $21,400,000. This increase was primarily due to greater sales in
most of the division's product lines and lower raw material costs. The decline
in manufacturing revenues during the last three years was due to the sale of
certain divisions and the discontinuance of certain non-performing product lines
in 1997 and prior years. The Company recorded charges of $4,300,000 in 1997 and
$3,700,000 in 1996 for losses on sales and shutdown expenses, which are
primarily reflected in the caption "Selling, general and other expenses."

Banking and Lending

      Finance revenues and operating profits reflect the level of consumer
instalment loans, and for 1998, the sale of substantially all of the Company's
executive and professional loan portfolio which resulted in a pre-tax gain of
approximately $6,500,000, as discussed above. In addition, automobile loan
losses declined in 1998 and 1997. In 1997, operating profit was also adversely
affected by $3,500,000 in costs to settle litigation related to a lending
program that is in liquidation. In 1996, operating profit was also affected by
increased interest expense on customer banking deposits.

Other

      In 1998, investment and other income increased by approximately
$16,300,000 primarily due to increased interest income ($63,700,000), the sale
of the Company's executive and professional loan portfolio referred to above
($6,500,000) and increased income from real estate activities ($8,800,000),
partially offset by reduced gains from sales of real estate and other assets
($40,700,000) and reduced income relating to the service business ($19,100,000).
In 1997, investment and other income increased by approximately $81,800,000,
primarily due to increased gains from sales of real estate properties
($63,500,000) including the sale of a New York City office building and
increased interest income ($28,100,000) including earnings on the proceeds from
the sales of the Colonial Penn Life Group and Colonial Penn P&C Group. Such
increases were partially offset by reduced trading stamp and miscellaneous other
revenues in 1997 and a litigation settlement gain recorded in 1996.

      During 1998, due to declines in values that were deemed other than
temporary, the Company recorded a pre-tax writedown of approximately $75,000,000
related to its investments in Russian and Polish debt and equity securities.
Such writedowns are reflected in the caption "Net securities gains (losses)." At
December 31, 1998, the remaining book value of the Company's investments in
these debt and equity securities was approximately $19,000,000.

      Equity in income (losses) of associated companies improved in 1998 as
compared to 1997 primarily due to a reduction of approximately $48,400,000 in
the Company's equity losses related to PIB resulting from



                                       27
<PAGE>
discontinuance of the equity method of accounting in early 1998 and income from
an investment partnership of approximately $30,800,000. In December 1997, the
Company invested $20,000,000 to acquire a limited partnership interest in this
partnership. The partnership currently is in the process of liquidating and
making final distributions. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of
income to be realized from this investment will be significant in 1999. Equity
in losses of associated companies increased in 1997 as compared to 1996
primarily due to start-up losses from the Company's equity investment in PIB of
$50,481,000 in 1997 as compared to $17,104,000 in 1996. The equity in losses of
associated companies included losses from the Company's investment in MK Gold of
$4,251,000 in 1997 and $6,478,000 in 1996 and a write-off of $6,540,000 in 1996,
representing the Company's investment in an unsuccessful well drilled by its
Siberian oil exploration joint venture.

      Interest expense primarily reflects the level of external borrowings
outstanding throughout the periods. The reduction in interest expense in 1997
was primarily due to the decline in such borrowings.

      The decrease in selling, general and other expenses in 1998 as compared to
1997 principally reflects decreased expenses of the manufacturing segment
principally as a result of the sale of certain divisions in 1997, decreased
pension expense due to the recognition of net curtailment gains of $6,500,000, a
1997 charge for estimated costs to settle litigation relating to a lending
program that is in liquidation and lower provisions for bad debts. The decrease
in selling, general and other expenses in 1997 as compared to 1996 principally
reflects the Empire Group's decreased expenses related to reduced premium
volume, decreased operating expenses of real estate properties, decreased
expenses relating to certain investment activities and lower provisions for bad
debts. This decrease was partially offset by the losses recorded by the
manufacturing segment related to sold divisions and the charge for estimated
costs to settle litigation relating to a lending program that is in liquidation.

      Income taxes for 1998 reflect a benefit of approximately $39,000,000 for a
change in the Company's estimated 1997 federal tax liability and the favorable
resolution of certain contingencies. The 1997 and 1996 income tax benefits were
greater than the expected normal corporate tax rate primarily due to the
favorable resolution of certain contingencies.

      As discussed above, in December 1998, the Company signed an agreement to
sell its remaining life insurance subsidiaries, Charter and Intramerica, to
Allstate. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary
closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 1999. In
1998, the Company classified these life insurance operations as discontinued
operations and the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been
restated to be consistent with such presentation.

      The number of shares used to calculate basic earnings (loss) per share was
63,409,000, 62,205,000 and 60,301,000 for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The
number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings (loss) per share was
63,510,000, 62,205,000 and 60,301,000 for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. For
diluted per share amounts, the Company's 5-1/4% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures due 2003 (which were redeemed in 1997) were not assumed to have been
converted since the effect of such assumed conversion would have been to
increase earnings per share.

Year 2000 and Information Technology Systems

      The Company is in the process of evaluating its information technology
systems to determine the potential impact of the Year 2000. The Year 2000 issue
is the result of computer programs being written using two digits (rather than
four) to define the applicable year. Any programs that have time-sensitive
software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year
2000, which could result in miscalculations or



                                       28
<PAGE>
system failures. As a result, before the end of 1999, computer hardware and
software may need to be upgraded with new hardware and software which can
distinguish 21st century dates from 20th century dates.

      Since 1996, the Company has been evaluating its Year 2000 readiness. Its
program to address its Year 2000 readiness consists of (i) the preparation of an
inventory of all computer related hardware and software, all non-computer
related hardware that may have embedded technology and all third parties that
are material to the Company's business operations, (ii) the identification of a
senior officer at each of the Company's operating subsidiaries and significant
investments to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Year 2000
program and reporting on compliance therewith to the Company's senior
management, (iii) the identification of mission critical aspects of the
Company's business, and assessment of the Year 2000 readiness of such mission
critical systems and components, (iv) the development of a plan to upgrade,
repair or replace systems as required for Year 2000 compliance, (v) the
development of a plan to test the readiness of all critical systems, (vi) making
inquiry of material third parties as to the state of their Year 2000 compliance,
and (vii) as appropriate, the development of a contingency plan for either
non-compliant internal systems or non-compliant material third parties. Where
appropriate, outside consultants have been engaged to advise the Company on its
Year 2000 readiness. Substantially all of the Company's operations have
completed the inventory and identification process and are in the process of
upgrading and testing critical systems. The Company's primary focus during the
balance of 1999 will be on continued testing of mission critical systems and
software provider upgrades, as well as monitoring the readiness of material
third parties.

      In 1996, the Empire Group began to evaluate its information technology
systems and their ability to support future business needs. This led to a
decision to acquire new policy management and accounting systems. These systems
provide enhanced functionality and improved processing for underwriting, claims,
billing, collection, reinsurance, reporting and accounting and are designed to
be Year 2000 compliant. The Empire Group anticipates that these new systems will
be fully implemented in 1999 and that any non-compliant programs will become
compliant during 1999. All but one of the manufacturing operation's material
systems (involving the storage of historical information) have tested as being
Year 2000 compliant. The Company is exploring alternative systems to maintain
this information. Until an acceptable replacement for this system can be found,
the Company can maintain these records in hard copy. The banking and lending
operations have successfully completed testing of mission critical systems and
testing of non-mission critical systems is currently underway. In addition,
deposit customers have been sent letters to inform them about the Year 2000
issue and to educate them about the progress made in addressing this issue.

      The Year 2000 issue may affect other entities with which the Company
transacts business. The Company has made inquiry of third parties with whom it
has material relationships as to the Year 2000 compliance of such third parties.
Many of such parties have reported plans to be fully compliant by the end of
1999 and most have reported substantial progress at the end of 1998. However, at
this time the Company cannot predict the effect of the Year 2000 on its material
third parties or the impact any deficiency in the Year 2000 readiness of such
parties could have on the Company.

      Through December 31, 1998, expenses incurred by the Company in connection

acquisition of new systems, which was not motivated by Year 2000 concerns) did
not exceed $500,000. Based upon current information, the Company does not expect
that the Year 2000 issue will have a material effect on its consolidated
financial position or consolidated results of operations.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

      The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk and
uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in
the forward-looking statements.

      The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk
related to its investment portfolio, its borrowing activities and the banking
and lending activities of certain subsidiaries. The Company does not enter into
material derivative financial instrument transactions.

      The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available
for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the
Company's investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised
approximately 90% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31,
1998. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or
are U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although limited
investments in "non-rated" or rated less than investment grade securities have
been made from time to time. The estimated weighted average remaining life of
these fixed income securities was approximately 2.5 years at December 31, 1998.
The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are
subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates
increase. At December 31, 1998, the Company's portfolio of trading securities
was not material. The Company manages the investment portfolio of its insurance
subsidiaries to preserve principal, maintain a high level of quality, comply
with applicable insurance industry regulations and achieve an acceptable rate of
return. In addition, the Company considers the duration of its insurance
reserves in comparison with that of its investments.

      The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed
interest rate debt and the Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of its subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities
of the Company. Generally, the fair market value of debt and preferred
securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and
the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.

      The Company's banking and lending operations are subject to risk resulting
from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between
the amount of the interest-earning assets and the amount of interest-bearing
liabilities that are prepaid/withdrawn, mature or reprice in specified periods.
The principal objectives of the Company's banking and lending asset/liability
management activities are to provide maximum levels of net interest income while
maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to
facilitate funding needs. The Company utilizes an interest rate sensitivity
model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate
risk that is present. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate
scenarios on the projected net interest margin over the ensuing twelve-month
period. Derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, may be
used to modify the Company's indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed
to be appropriate based on risk management policies and the Company's current
economic outlook. Counterparties to such agreements are major financial
institutions, which the Company believes are able to fulfill their obligations;
however, if they are not, the Company believes that any losses are unlikely to
be material.

      The following table provides information about the Company's financial
instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes
in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table
presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates. For the variable rate
notes receivable and variable rate borrowings, the weighted average interest
rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting
date. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the
table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Company's
historical experience of loan prepayments and prepayments of mortgage-backed
securities. For banking and lending's variable rate products, the weighted
average variable rates are based upon the respective pricing index at the
reporting date. For money market

deposits that have no contractual maturity, the table presents principal cash
flows based on the Company's historical experience and management's judgment
concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors. For interest rate swaps, the
table presents notional amounts by contractual maturity date.

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


March 8, 1999


To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Leucadia National Corporation


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under item 14(a) (1) (2) of this Form 10-K, present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Leucadia National Corporation and
Subsidiaries at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index
appearing under item 14(a) (1) (2) of this Form 10-K, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Nature of Operations:

The Company is a diversified financial services holding company engaged in
personal and commercial lines of property and casualty insurance, principally in
the New York metropolitan area, banking and lending and manufacturing,
principally in markets in the United States, and real estate activities. The
Company's principal operations are its insurance businesses, of which its
principal personal lines insurance products are automobile insurance and
homeowners insurance. The Company's principal commercial lines are property and
casualty products provided for vehicles (including medallion and
radio-controlled livery vehicles), multi-family residential real estate,
workers' compensation and various other business classes.

The Company's banking and lending operations principally consist of making
instalment loans to niche markets primarily funded by deposits insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company's manufacturing operations
manufacture and market proprietary plastic netting used for a variety of
purposes.

In 1998, the Company classified as discontinued operations its life insurance
subsidiaries, Charter National Life Insurance Company ("Charter") and
Intramerica Life Insurance Company ("Intramerica"). Prior period financial
statements have been restated to conform with this presentation.

2.  Significant Accounting Policies:

(a) Use of Estimates in Preparing Financial Statements: The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

(b) Consolidation Policy: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all majority-owned and controlled entities. All
significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in
consolidation.

Investments in entities which the Company does not control but has the ability
to exercise significant influence are accounted for on the equity method of
accounting.

Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to be consistent with
the 1998 presentation and for discontinued operations.

(c) Statements of Cash Flows: The Company considers short-term investments,
which have maturities of less than three months at the time of acquisition, to
be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments of
$323,305,000 and $414,833,000 at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

(d) Investments: At acquisition, marketable debt and equity securities are
designated as either i) held to maturity, which are carried at amortized cost,
ii) trading, which are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and
losses reflected in results of operations, or iii) available for sale, which are
carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a
separate component of shareholders' equity, net of taxes. Held to maturity
investments are made with the intention of holding such securities to maturity,
which the Company has the ability to do. Estimated fair values are principally
based on quoted market prices.


                                       F-7
<PAGE>
2.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:

Investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary
are written down to estimated net realizable values. The writedowns are included
in "Net securities gains (losses)" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
cost of securities sold is based on average cost.

The Company's investments in Russian and Polish equity securities ($18,992,000
and $51,025,000 as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively), none of which
is held by the insurance or banking subsidiaries, do not have readily
determinable fair values. Given the uncertainties inherent in investing in the
emerging markets of Russia and Poland, the Company is accounting for these
investments under the cost recovery method, whereby all receipts are applied to
reduce the investment. Quarterly, the Company reviews its investment in Russian
and Polish equity securities to determine that the carrying amount is
realizable. In performing such reviews, the Company considers current market
prices, prior sale transactions, the current political and economic environment
and other factors. These investments are included in "Other investments" in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 1998, due to declines in values that were
deemed other than temporary, the Company recorded a pre-tax writedown of
approximately $75,000,000 related to its investments in Russian and Polish debt
and equity securities. Such writedowns are reflected in the caption "Net
securities gains (losses)."

(e) Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements: Property, equipment and
leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and
amortization ($76,397,000 and $67,116,000 at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively). Depreciation and amortization are provided principally on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, if less,
the term of the underlying lease.

(f) Income Recognition from Insurance Operations: Premiums on property and
casualty insurance products are recognized as revenues over the term of the
policy using the monthly pro rata basis.

(g) Policy Acquisition Costs: Policy acquisition costs principally consist of
commissions, premium taxes and other underwriting expenses (net of reinsurance
allowances). If recoverability of such costs from future premiums and related
investment income is not anticipated, the amounts not considered recoverable are
charged to operations.

Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms of
the related policies.

(h) Reinsurance: In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce
the loss that may arise from catastrophes and to limit losses from large
exposures by reinsuring certain levels of risk with other insurance enterprises.
Catastrophe reinsurance treaties serve to reduce property and casualty insurance
risk in geographic areas where the Company is exposed to natural disasters,
primarily the New York metropolitan area. Reinsurance contracts do not
necessarily legally relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders.

Reinsurance recoverables are reported as assets net of provisions for
uncollectible amounts. Premiums earned and other underwriting expenses are
stated net of reinsurance.

(i) Policy Reserves and Unearned Premiums: Liabilities for unpaid losses and
loss adjustment expenses ("LAE") applicable to the property and casualty
insurance operations are determined using case basis evaluations, statistical
analyses for losses incurred but not reported and estimates for salvage and
subrogation recoverable and represent estimates of ultimate claim costs and loss
adjustment expenses. As more information becomes available and claims are
settled, the


                                       F-8
<PAGE>
2.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:

estimated liabilities are adjusted upward or downward with the effect of
decreasing or increasing net income at the time of adjustment.

(j) Income Taxes: The Company provides for income taxes using the liability
method. The future benefit of certain tax loss carryforwards and future
deductions is recorded as an asset and the provisions for income taxes are not
reduced for the benefit from utilization of tax loss carryforwards. A valuation
allowance is provided if deferred tax assets are not considered more likely than
not to be realized.

(k) Derivative Financial Instruments: The Company enters into interest rate
agreements to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on its customer
banking deposits. The difference between the amounts paid and received is
accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense (the accrual
accounting method). Cash flows related to the agreements are classified as
operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consistent
with the interest payments on the underlying debt. The Company also enters into
currency rate swap agreements to hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Gains and losses on such hedges are reported as a component of shareholders'
equity. The Company does not have material derivative financial instruments.

(l) Translation of Foreign Currency: Foreign currency denominated investments
and financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange
rates, except that revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange
rates during each reporting period; resulting translation adjustments are
reported as a component of shareholders' equity. Net foreign exchange gains
(losses) were not material.

(m) Recently Issued Accounting Standard: In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"), which will be
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. The Company is
reviewing the impact of the implementation of SFAS 133 on the Company's
financial position and results of operations.


3.  Acquisitions:

In 1996, the Company formed a joint venture, Pepsi International Bottlers
("PIB") with PepsiCo, Inc. to be the exclusive bottler and distributor of
PepsiCo beverages in a large portion of central and eastern Russia, Kyrgyzstan
and Kazakstan. The Company contributed $79,500,000 to PIB for a 75% equity
interest. Effective as of January 30, 1998, the Company entered into an
agreement with PepsiCo, pursuant to which, among other things, PIB repaid in
full the Company's $77,705,000 bridge financing and the Company's equity
interest in PIB was reduced to 37.9%. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company no
longer had any ability to influence PIB; effective February 1, 1998, the Company
discontinued accounting for this investment under the equity method of
accounting. The agreement relieved the Company of any future funding obligation
with respect to PIB and created an option exercisable by either the Company or
PepsiCo, pursuant to which PepsiCo was obligated to purchase all of the
Company's interest in PIB (the "Option") for $37,000,000, plus interest. In
February 1999, PepsiCo exercised the Option for approximately $39,190,000,
including interest. The Company will recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately
$29,545,000 in the first quarter of 1999. However, when combined with the
Company's share of the joint venture losses since inception, the Company's net
loss from this investment was approximately $40,310,000.

The Company's investment in PIB is included in the caption "Investments in
associated companies."

                                       F-9

3.  Acquisitions, continued:

In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company acquired a 95.4% interest in Fidei
S.A., a French company listed on the Paris Stock Exchange that is engaged
directly and through subsidiaries in real estate activities, for approximately
$62,300,000, including expenses. In connection with this acquisition, the
Company entered into currency swap agreements to hedge approximately $55,000,000
of its foreign currency exposure. The counterparties to these currency swap
agreements are major financial institutions, which management believes are able
to fulfill their obligations. The swap agreements mature in tranches in March
2000 and September 2001.


4.  Investments in Associated Companies:

The Company has investments in several Associated Companies that have adopted
various fiscal year-ends. The Company records its portion of the earnings of
such companies based on fiscal periods ended up to three months prior to the end
of the Company's reporting period.

The following table provides certain summarized data with respect to the
Associated Companies accounted for on the equity method of accounting included
in 1998, 1997 and 1996 results of operations. (Amounts are in thousands.)

In December 1997, the Company invested $20,000,000 to acquire a limited
partnership interest in an investment partnership. During 1998, the Company
recognized income from this partnership of approximately $30,800,000. The
partnership currently is in the process of liquidating and making final
distributions. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of income to be
realized from this investment will be significant in 1999.

As of December 31, 1998, the Company owned a 30% interest in Caja de Ahorro y
Seguro S.A. ("Caja"), a holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in
property and casualty insurance, life insurance, workers' compensation insurance
and banking in Argentina. During 1998, the Company's previously announced
agreement to sell substantially all of its interest in Caja to its Argentine
partner was restructured, and in March 1999, the Company sold all of its
interest in Caja to Assicurazioni Generali Group, an Italian insurance company,
for $126,000,000 in cash and a $40,000,000 collateralized note

6. Discontinued Operations:

In September 1998, the Company reinsured, retroactive to January 1, 1998,
substantially all of its life insurance business to Allstate Life Insurance
Company ("Allstate") and a subsidiary thereof in an indemnity reinsurance
transaction. While the premium received on this transaction was approximately
$28,675,000, the gain on the reinsurance transaction was deferred and is being
amortized into income based upon actuarial estimates of the premium revenue of
the underlying insurance contracts. In December 1998, the Company signed an
agreement to sell its life insurance subsidiaries, Charter and Intramerica, to
Allstate for statutory surplus at the date of sale (approximately $62,200,000 at
December 31, 1998), plus $3,575,000. This transaction is expected to result


                                      F-12

6. Discontinued Operations, continued:

in a pre-tax gain of approximately $20,000,000, principally resulting from
recognition of deferred gains from prior reinsurance transactions, including the
reinsurance transaction described above. The transaction is subject to
regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close
in the second quarter of 1999.

In September 1997, the Company completed the sale of the Colonial Penn Life
Group to Conseco, Inc. for $460,000,000, including $400,000,000 in notes
maturing on January 2, 2003 collateralized by non-cancelable letters of credit
and $60,000,000 in cash. These companies were principally engaged in the sale of
graded benefit life insurance policies through direct marketing and agent-sold
Medicare supplement insurance. The Company reported a pre-tax gain of
approximately $271,750,000 on the sale. In connection with the sale of the
Colonial Penn Life Group, the Company reinsured certain life insurance policies
for a premium of $25,000,000. The gain on this reinsurance transaction was
deferred and is being amortized into income based on actuarial estimates of the
premium revenue of the underlying insurance contracts. Upon the closing of the
sale to Allstate described above, the remaining deferred gain will be recognized
in income.

In November 1997, the Company completed the sale of the property and casualty
insurance business of the Colonial Penn P&C Group to General Electric Capital
Corporation for total cash consideration of $1,018,100,000, plus $14,300,000 for
retention of certain employee benefit liabilities. The Group's primary business
was providing private passenger automobile insurance to the mature adult
population through direct response marketing. The Company reported a pre-tax
gain of approximately $589,950,000 on the sale.

At December 31, 1998 the Company had an unsecured bank credit facility of
$100,000,000 which bears interest based on the prime rate or LIBOR and matures
in November 2002. $65,500,000 was borrowed under this bank credit facility as of
December 31, 1998.

The Euro denominated debt, which is non-recourse to the Company, is entirely
related to the acquisition of Fidei.

The most restrictive of the Company's debt instruments require maintenance of
minimum Tangible Net Worth and limit Indebtedness, as defined in the agreements.
In addition, the debt instruments contain limitations on dividends, investments,
liens, contingent obligations and certain other matters. As of December 31,
1998, cash dividends of approximately $579,000,000 would be eligible to be paid
under the most restrictive covenants.

The Company reported extraordinary losses on early extinguishment of its 5 1/4%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2003 (the "5 1/4% Debentures") and its
10 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2002 of $3,165,000 ($2,057,000 after taxes
or $.03 per share) in 1997 and $10,520,000 ($6,838,000 after taxes or $.11 per
share) in 1996.

Approximately $10,470,000 of the manufacturing division's net property,
equipment and leasehold improvements are pledged as collateral for the
Industrial Revenue Bonds; and approximately $94,030,000 of other assets
(primarily investments and property) are pledged for other indebtedness
aggregating approximately $49,182,000.

Interest rate agreements are used to manage the potential impact of changes in
interest rates on customer banking deposits. Under interest rate swap
agreements, the Company has agreed with other parties to pay fixed rate interest
amounts and receive variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an
agreed notional amount. The variable interest rate portion of the swaps is a
specified LIBOR interest rate. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the notional
amounts of the Company's interest rate swaps were $60,000,000 and $25,000,000,
respectively. These interest rate swaps expire in 2003 and require fixed rate
payments of 5.07%. The Company would have been required to pay $292,000 at
December 31, 1998 and $636,000 at December 31, 1997 to retire these agreements.
The LIBOR rate at December 31, 1998 was 5.07%. Changes in LIBOR interest rates
in the future will change the amounts to be received under the agreements as
well as interest to be paid under the related variable debt obligations. In
connection with

11.  Indebtedness, continued:

the acquisition of Fidei, the Company borrowed $62,300,000 under its bank credit
facility and entered into currency swap agreements to hedge approximately
$55,000,000 of its foreign currency exposure. The swap agreements mature in
tranches in March 2000 and September 2001.

Counterparties to interest rate and currency swap agreements are major financial
institutions, which management believes are able to fulfill their obligations.
Any losses due to default by the counterparties are likely to be immaterial.

The aggregate annual mandatory redemptions of debt during the five year period
ending December 31, 2003 are as follows (in thousands): 1999 - $99,142; 2000 -
$870; 2001 - $71,170; 2002 - $8,006; and, 2003 - $97,803.

The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings (primarily customer
banking deposits) was 5.8% and 5.9% at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

12.  Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust:

In January 1997, the Company sold $150,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount of
8.65% trust issued preferred securities of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Leucadia
Capital Trust I (the "Trust"). These Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities have an effective maturity date of January 15, 2027 and
represent undivided beneficial interests in the Trust's assets, which consist
solely of $154,640,000 principal amount of 8.65% Junior Subordinated Deferrable
Interest Debentures due 2027 of the Company. Considered together, the "back-up
undertakings" of the Company related to the Trust's preferred securities
constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the Trust's
obligations under the preferred securities. During 1998, a subsidiary of the
Company repurchased $51,800,000 aggregate liquidation amount of the 8.65% trust
issued preferred securities for $42,200,000, plus accrued interest. The
difference between the purchase price and the book value was credited directly
to shareholders' equity, net of taxes.


13. Common Shares, Stock Options and Preferred Shares:

The Board of Directors from time to time has authorized acquisitions of the
Company's Common Shares. In October 1998, the Company's Board of Directors
increased to 6,000,000 the maximum number of shares that the Company is
authorized to purchase. During the three year period ended December 31, 1998,
the Company acquired 2,111,193 Common Shares at an average price of $29.23 per
Common Share. From January 1, 1999 through March 12, 1999, the Company acquired
1,738,570 Common Shares at an average price of $29.98 per Common Share. As a
result, as of March 13, 1999, the Company is authorized to repurchase 3,788,717
Common Shares.

The Company has a fixed stock option plan which provides for grants of options
or rights to non-employee directors and certain employees up to a maximum grant
of three hundred thousand shares to any individual in a given taxable year. The
plan provides for the issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights at
not less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of
grant. Options generally become exercisable in five equal annual instalments
starting one year from date of grant. No stock appreciation rights have been
granted.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation", ("SFAS 123"), establishes a fair value method for accounting for
stock-based compensation plans, either through recognition in the statements of
income or disclosure. As permitted, the Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and
related Interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized in the statements of income for its
stock-based compensation plans. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock
option plans been recorded in the statements of income consistent with the
provisions of SFAS 123, the Company's net income and earnings per share for
1998, 1997 and 1996 would not have been materially different from those
reported.

date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions: (1) expected volatility of 20.0% for 1998, 20.3% for 1997 and 25.3%
for 1996 (2) risk-free interest rates of 5.6% for 1998, 6.1% for 1997 and 6.0%
for 1996; (3) expected lives of 4.0 years for 1998 and 3.7 years for 1997 and
1996; and (4) dividend yields of .7% for 1998 and .9% for 1997 and 1996.

The valuation allowance principally relates to capital loss carryforwards,
certain acquired tax loss carryforwards, the usage of which is subject to
certain limitations and certain other matters which may restrict their
utilization, and unrealized capital losses. Upon the closing of the sale of the
Company's interest in Caja (see Note 4), the valuation allowance will be reduced
by approximately $30,000,000 due to the availability of capital loss
carryforwards to offset a portion of the capital gain.

16.  Income Taxes, continued:

Reflected above as recognition of additional tax benefits, are reductions to the
Company's income tax provision for the favorable resolution of certain
contingencies and, in 1998, for a change in the Company's 1997 estimated federal
income tax liability. The valuation allowance applicable to the deferred income
tax asset gives effect to the possible unavailability of certain income tax
deductions. During 1998, 1997 and 1996 certain matters were favorably resolved
and the Company reduced the valuation allowance as reflected in the above
reconciliation. However, during 1998, the valuation allowance was also increased
by approximately $38,000,000 for capital losses.

At December 31, 1998, the Company had tax loss carryforwards of $15,000,000,
which are available to reduce federal income tax payments for the entire
consolidated group, and certain of the Company's subsidiaries had tax loss
carryforwards of $47,000,000, which can only be used to reduce federal income
tax payments for the group that generated the carryforward. The tax loss
carryforwards of the Company and its subsidiaries have been reflected in the
deferred tax liability after applying the statutory federal income tax rate less
any applicable tax sharing payments to the Internal Revenue Service. The tax
loss carryforwards of the Company expire primarily in 2010. The tax loss
carryforwards of the Company's subsidiaries expire in 2002 and 2003. In
addition, at December 31, 1998 the Company had capital loss carryforwards of
$110,000,000 which expire in 2002 and 2003.

Limitations exist under the tax law which may restrict the utilization of the
tax loss carryforwards. In addition, the capital loss carryforwards can only be
used to offset capital gains. These limitations are considered in the
determination of the valuation allowance.

Under certain circumstances, the value of the carryforwards available could be
substantially reduced if certain changes in ownership were to occur. In order to
reduce this possibility, the Company's certificate of incorporation includes
restrictions which prohibit transfers of the Company's Common Stock under
certain circumstances.

In connection with the sale of certain of the Company's operations in recent
years, the Company had indemnified the purchasers for certain tax matters. The
Company does not believe that such indemnification obligation will result in any
additional material liability to the Company.

17.  Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits:

The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans covering employees of
certain units who meet age and service requirements. Benefits are generally
based on final average salary and years of service. The Company funds its
pension plans in amounts sufficient to satisfy minimum ERISA funding
requirements. Effective December 31, 1998, the Company froze its defined benefit
pension plans which resulted in the recognition of approximately $6,500,000 of
net curtailment gains.

A summary of activity with respect to the Company's pension plans for 1998 and
1997 is as follows (in thousands):

17.  Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits, continued:

The projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1998 and 1997 was determined
using an assumed discount rate of 6.75% and 7.0%, respectively, and, for 1997,
an assumed compensation increase rate of 4.3%. The assumed long-term rate of
return on plan assets was 7.5% and 7.4% at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

The Company also has defined contribution pension plans covering certain
employees. Contributions and costs are a percent of each covered employee's
salary. Amounts charged to expense related to such plans were $1,057,000,
$1,202,000 and $1,340,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.

Several subsidiaries provide certain health care and other benefits to certain
retired employees under plans which are currently unfunded. The Company pays the
cost of postretirement benefits as they are incurred. Amounts charged (credited)
to expense (principally amortization of a curtailment gain in 1998 and 1997 and
interest in 1996) related to such benefits were $(1,990,000) in 1998,
$(2,851,000) in 1997 and $1,355,000 in 1996.

A summary of activity with respect to the Company's postretirement plans for
1998 and 1997 is as follows:

                                                     1998            1997

                                                   =======          =======

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 6.75% and 7.0% at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The
assumed health care cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation were between 6.0% and 9.5% for 1998 and 6.9%
and 10.5% for 1997, declining to an ultimate rate of between 5.0% and 6.0% by
2006.

If the health care cost trend rates were increased or decreased by 1%, the
accumulated postretirement obligation as of December 31, 1998 would have
increased or decreased by $823,000 and $729,000, respectively. The effect of
these changes on the aggregate of service and interest cost for 1998 would be
immaterial.


18.  Commitments:

The Company and its subsidiaries rent office space and office equipment under
non-cancelable operating leases with terms generally varying from one to twenty
years. Rental expense (net of sublease rental income) charged to operations was
$7,680,000 in 1998, $7,307,000 in 1997 and $8,583,000 in 1996. Aggregate minimum
annual rentals (exclusive of real estate taxes, maintenance and certain other

                                      F-26

charges) relating to facilities under lease in effect at December 31, 1998 are
as follows (in thousands): 1999 - $7,144; 2000 - $6,982; 2001 - $6,912; 2002 -
$6,772; 2003 - $6,495; and thereafter - $103,802. Future minimum sublease rental
income relating to facilities under lease in effect at December 31, 1998 are as
follows (in thousands): 1999 - $848; 2000 - $863; 2001 - $868; 2002 - $876; 2003
- - $883; and thereafter - $4,049.

Included in the amounts shown above are the gross future minimum annual rental
payments relating to a twenty year lease which the Empire Group entered into
beginning November 1998 for its executive and administrative offices. These
offices are in an office building in which the Company has an equity interest.
The above amounts have not been reduced for the Company's share of rental income
due to its equity participation in this office building. In connection with this
equity investment, the Company has committed to invest up to $25,000,000, of
which $5,000,000 is currently invested.

In connection with the sale of certain subsidiaries, the Company has made or
guaranteed the accuracy of certain representations given to the acquiror. No
material loss is expected in connection with such matters.

In connection with the sale of the Colonial Penn P&C Group, the Company provided
the purchaser with a $100,000,000 non-cancelable letter of credit to
collateralize certain indemnification obligations. This letter of credit is
collateralized by certain deposits of the Company aggregating approximately
$105,000,000.

The insurance and the banking and lending subsidiaries are limited by regulatory
requirements and agreements in the amount of dividends and other transfers of
funds that are available to the Company. Principally as a result of such
restrictions, the net assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on
transfer of funds to the Company were approximately $293,888,000 at December 31,
1998.

19.  Litigation:

The Company is subject to various litigation which arises in the course of its
business. Based on discussions with counsel, management is of the opinion that
such litigation will have no material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position of the Company or its consolidated results of operations.

Options to purchase 886,730 and 1,144,431 weighted average shares of common
stock were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted (loss) per
share, as those options were antidilutive.

Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 1996, and for the period
January 1, 1997 through April 11, 1997, the 5 1/4% Debentures, which were
convertible into 3,478,260 Common Shares, were outstanding. Such debentures were
not included in the computation of diluted (loss) per share, as those debentures
were antidilutive.

21.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The following table presents fair value information about certain financial
instruments, whether or not recognized on the balance sheet. Where quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value
or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by
the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash
flows. The fair value amounts presented do not purport to represent and should
not be considered representative of the underlying "market" or franchise value
of the Company. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of
each class of the financial instruments described below are as follows:


                                      F-28
<PAGE>
21.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments, continued:

(a) Investments: The fair values of marketable equity securities, fixed maturity
securities and investments held for trading purposes (which include securities
sold not owned) are substantially based on quoted market prices, as disclosed in
Note 7.

(b) Cash and cash equivalents: For cash equivalents, the carrying amount
approximates fair value.

(c) Notes receivable on the sale of the Colonial Penn Life Group: The fair value
of variable rate note receivable is estimated to be the carrying amount.

(d) Loan receivables of banking and lending subsidiaries: The fair value of
loan receivables of the banking and lending subsidiaries is estimated by
discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans
would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the same remaining
maturities.

(e) Investments in associated companies: For 1998, the fair value of Caja is
based upon the sales price as discussed in Note 4. For 1997, the fair value of
Caja was estimated to be the carrying amount. The fair values of a foreign power
company are principally estimated based upon quoted market prices. The carrying
value of the remaining investments in associated companies approximates fair
value.

(f) Customer banking deposits: The fair value of customer banking deposits is
estimated using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining
maturities.

(g) Long-term and other indebtedness: The fair values of non-variable rate debt
are estimated using quoted market prices and estimated rates which would be
available to the Company for debt with similar terms. The fair value of variable
rate debt is estimated to be the carrying amount.

22.  Segment Information:

In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information"
("SFAS 131"), which requires a "management" approach for segment disclosure. The
management approach designates the internal organization that is used by
management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
source of the Company's reportable segments. SFAS 131 also requires disclosures
about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.

For information with respect to the Company's segments, see "Financial
Information about Industry Segments" in Item 1 of the Report, which is

                         Report of Independent Auditors

To the Partners of
Gotham Partners Acquisition I, L.P.

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition of Gotham
Partners Acquisition I, L.P. (the "Partnership"), including the condensed
schedule of investments, as of December 31, 1998, and the related statements of
income, changes in partners' capital and cash flows for the year then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Gotham Partners Acquisition I,
L.P. at December 31, 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

                          Notes to Financial Statements

                                December 31, 1998



1. ORGANIZATION

Gotham Partners Acquisition I, L.P. (the "Partnership") was organized as a
limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware and commenced
operations on October 22, 1997. The Partnership's investment objective is to
achieve maximum capital appreciation through investments in securities of
McDonald's Corp. (the "Company"). In order to achieve its objective, the
Partnership may invest in the shares of the capital stock of the Company and any
options, warrants, convertible securities or derivative instruments related to
the Company and in the securities resulting from any spin-off, reorganization,
merger or recapitalization of the Company.

GPA I, L.L.C. (the "General Partner") makes all investment decisions on behalf
of the Partnership and is solely responsible for the development and
implementation of the Partnership's investment policy and strategy.

The Partnership is in the process of liquidating its investments and
distributing the capital to the partners. Once all of the capital has been
distributed, the Partnership will be terminated.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Partnership records its securities transactions on a trade date basis.
Securities listed on a national securities exchange are valued at their last
reported sales price. Securities for which no such market prices are available
are valued at fair value by the General Partner on a reasonable basis and in
good faith. At December 31, 1998, over-the-counter options totaling $10,044,480
were valued at their estimated fair values using prices furnished by the
counterparty to the respective contracts.

Net income was allocated in accordance with the terms of the Partnership
Agreement.

No Federal, state or local income taxes have been provided since the partners
are individually liable for the taxes on their share of the Partnership's
income.


                                                                             7

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)



2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The fair value of the Partnership's assets and liabilities which qualify as
financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
"Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments," approximates the
carrying amounts presented in the statement of financial condition.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

3. DUE FROM BROKER

Due from broker represents cash balances with the clearing broker.

4. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

The Partnership is engaged in trading over-the-counter stock options with
certain counterparties. These financial instruments expose the Partnership to
credit risk arising from the potential inability of counterparties to perform
under the terms of the contracts.

All securities transactions of the Partnership listed on a national securities
exchange are cleared by a major U.S. securities firm pursuant to a customer
agreement. At December 31, 1998, all of the investments in equity securities and
due from broker are positions with and amounts due from this broker.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

All options are reported at fair value and changes in fair values are reflected
in the statement of income. The average monthly fair value of options held
during the year was $67,672,760. The fair value of options held at December 31,
1998 was $10,044,480. Net realized and unrealized gains on options held during
the year was $91,714,634.


                                                                             8

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)



6. INCENTIVE ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTIONS

The General Partner is entitled to an incentive allocation of 20% of the net
capital appreciation attributable to a limited partner's capital account at the
end of each measuring period, defined in the Partnership Agreement, in part, to
be the period beginning on the date of admission and ending on the date
designated as the record date as of which a distribution is to be made to such
limited partner. Each limited partner is entitled to a 15% compounded annual
preferred return, as defined in the Partnership Agreement, on its capital
investment during the measuring period before the General Partner is allocated
an incentive allocation. Upon satisfaction of the preferred return, the General
Partner receives priority allocations to "catch up" to a 20% share of net
capital appreciation during the measuring period. After the preferred return and
the "catch up" allocations, any remaining net capital appreciation is allocated,
at the end of each measuring period, 80% to the limited partner and 20% to the
General Partner. In the event of a partial distribution being made to all
limited partners on a pro rata basis, the General Partner is not entitled to its
full incentive allocation, but rather a partial incentive allocation based on
the amount being distributed. The General Partner, in its sole discretion, may
elect to waive all or any portion of the incentive allocation with respect to
any one or more limited partners.

August 31, 1998 was designated as the end of the first measuring period.
Accordingly, the Partnership distributed $91,045,377 to the limited partners on
September 14, 1998. In connection with the pro rata distribution, the General
Partner received an incentive allocation of $4,690,515, of which $2,954,623 was
paid to the General Partner on September 14, 1998. The remaining $1,735,892 of
the General Partner's incentive allocation was distributed to the General
Partner on October 22, 1998, along with $1,758,423, the General Partner's pro
rata share of the Partnership's earnings from September 1, 1998 to October 21,
1998.

Because the Partnership Agreement provides that incentive allocations can only
be made at the end of a measuring period, no incentive allocation of the net
capital appreciation from September 1, 1998 through December 31, 1998 is
reflected in the financial statements.

January 21, 1999 was designated as the end of the second measuring period.
Accordingly, the Partnership distributed $37,263,233 to the limited partners on
January 22, 1999. In connection with the pro rata distribution, the General
Partner received an incentive allocation of $5,247,250, which was paid to the
General Partner on January 22, 1999.


                                                                             9

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)



The Partnership intends to make final distributions to all partners once all
investments have been liquidated and the Partnership's final audit has been
completed.

<PAGE>
John W. Jordan II nor David W. Zalaznick shall, during the term hereof, engage

or corporation employed by the LLC to render or perform a service, or from or
through whom the LLC may make any sale or purchase, shall not prohibit the LLC
from engaging in any transaction with such person, firm or corporation, or
create any duty of legal justification additional to that which would exist if

such fee is comparable to that which would be charged to customers not
affiliated with a Member for similar services.

            (d) The retention by the LLC of the services of any Affiliates of a
Member shall not constitute any such Affiliate a co-partner or joint venturer
with the LLC, and the relationship of the LLC to each such Affiliate shall at
all times remain that of principal and independent contractor, respectively.

Section 2.5. Loans

            Any Member may, but shall not be required to, make loans to the LLC

any greater allocated portion of losses which he or it may sustain as provided
herein.

the Members, for any act or omission on his or its part, or any act or omission
of any employee, agent or attorney-in-fact of the LLC, except for the results of
his or its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The LLC shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Member or Manager (including a Managing
Director) from and against any costs, expenses, damages, claims, and personal
liability including judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement (with the
consent of three members of the Committee) and related expenses (including fees
and expenses of counsel) arising



                                  15
<PAGE>
out of any claim or liability of any nature whatsoever in respect of the assets
or business of the LLC, except where attributable to the gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith of the Member or the Manager (including a
Managing Director).

            (c) The indemnification permitted under Section 420 of the NYLLC Law
shall be in addition to any other rights to which each Member and Manager (an
"Indemnitee") may be entitled under any agreement or vote of the Members, as a
matter of law or otherwise, both (i) as to action in the Indemnitee's capacity
as a Member, Manager or as an officer, director, shareholder, member or partner
of a Member, Manager or of an Affiliate, and (ii) as to action in another
capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such
capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns,
administrators and personal representatives of the Indemnitee.

            (d) The LLC may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of one or
more Indemnitees and other persons against any liability which may be asserted
against, or expense which may be incurred by, any such person in connection with
the LLC's activities, whether or not the LLC would have the power to indemnify
such person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.



                                  16
<PAGE>
            (e) Any indemnification hereunder shall be satisfied only out of the
assets of the LLC, and the Members and the Manager shall not be subject to
personal liability by reason of these indemnification provisions.

            (f) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in
part under this Section 2.6 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction
was otherwise permitted or not prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

            (g) The provisions of this Section 2.6 are for the benefit of each
Indemnitee and his heirs, successors, assigns, administrators and personal
representatives as provided herein, and shall not be deemed to create any rights
for the benefit of any other persons. 

Section 2.7. Other Matters Concerning the Members

            (a) Each Member or Manager may rely on, and shall be protected in
acting or refraining from acting upon, any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture,
or other paper or document reasonably believed by him to be genuine and to have
been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants,

more agents or employees of the LLC and any advice or opinion of any such person
as to matters which such Member reasonably believes to be within such person's
professional or expert competence, and any act or omission, if done or omitted
to be done in reliance upon any such advice or opinion, will be conclusively
presumed to have been done or omitted to be done in good faith and not to
constitute fraud, gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.

<PAGE>
            (d) Whether any assets of the LLC shall be liquidated through sale

articles of dissolution of the LLC; however, a Managing Director shall retain
full authority to direct the disbursement and/or the



                                  32
<PAGE>
distribution of the funds, if any, held pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement (including subsection (a) of Section 5.5), which funds shall be
distributed in accordance with the priorities set forth in subsection (c) of
this Section 5.4.

            (f) No Member shall be personally liable to any other Member for the
return of his or its Capital Contributions or any portion thereof; any such
return shall be made solely from LLC assets in accordance with the priorities
established by this Agreement.

Section 5.5.  Amounts Reserved

            (a) If there is any pending transaction or claim by or against the
LLC as to which the interest or obligation of the LLC therein cannot, in the
judgment of a Managing Director (or the Liquidating Agent), be then ascertained,
then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
if such transaction or claim shall constitute an asset or potential asset of the
LLC, the value or potential value thereof as specified by a Managing Director
with the written consent of three members of the Committee, shall be added to
the valuation of the assets of the LLC for purposes of computing the
distributions to be made pursuant to Section 5.1 and/or Section 5.4 hereof, or
(ii) if such transaction or claim shall constitute a



                                  33
<PAGE>
liability or potential liability of the LLC, then an amount specified by a
Managing Director acting with the written consent of three members of the
Committee as a reserve for any loss or probable loss therefrom shall be deducted
from the valuation of assets of the LLC for purposes of computing the
distributions to be made pursuant to Section 5.1 and/or Section 5.4 hereof,
whether or not such reserve is required to be established therefor for financial
accounting purposes.

            (b) Upon determination by a Managing Director (or the Liquidating
Agent) with the written consent of three members of the Committee that
circumstances no longer require the retention of any sum or assets as provided
in this Section 5.5, a Managing Director (or the Liquidating Agent) shall, at
the earliest practical time pay such sum or deliver such assets, without
interest, in accordance with applicable priorities set forth in this Agreement.

Section 5.6. Special Arrangements

            (a) If the John W. Jordan II Revocable Trust or David W. Zalaznick,
as a Managing Director or any of their respective Affiliates raises a "Fund,"
then Leucadia, Inc. shall have a 10% interest in all profit participations
received by such Managing Director or his Affiliates from such Fund and a 10%
interest in all Net Consulting Fees and



                                  34
<PAGE>
Net Investment Banking Fees (collectively, "Net Fees") received by such Managing
Director or his Affiliates from transactions and/or investee companies of the
Fund, but Leucadia, Inc. shall have no interest in any Management Fees received
by such Managing Director or his Affiliates from such Fund or in any profit
participations, Net Fees or Management Fees received by such Managing Director
or his Affiliates from or in respect of any other fund raised by the Managing
Director or his Affiliates. For example, if such Managing Director or his
Affiliates receives from such Fund a $500,000 asset management fee, $500,000 in
Net Fees and $2,000,000 in profit participation, Leucadia, Inc. shall be
entitled to no part of the asset management fee, $50,000 of the Net Fees
($500,000 x 10% = $50,000) and $200,000 of the profit participation ($2,000,000
x 10% = $200,000) received by the Managing Director or his Affiliates from or in
respect of the Fund. Payments in respect of Leucadia, Inc.'s interest in such
sums shall be made promptly upon receipt thereof by the Managing Director or his
Affiliates from or in respect of the Fund.

            (b) If the LLC is dissolved pursuant to Section 5.04(a) because of
any of the events enumerated therein, then,

<PAGE>
                      (i) in addition to all other sums to which Leucadia, Inc.
            shall be entitled under this Agreement, Leucadia, Inc. shall be
            entitled to receive its pro rata interest in all Net Buyout Fees and
            Net Investment Banking Fees received from Clients pursuant to
            definitive agreements entered into prior to the dissolution of the
            LLC; and

                         LLC COSTS AND EXPENSES

Section 6.1.  Compensation to Managing Directors

            (a)   The LLC shall pay, as a fee (the "Management
Fee") for the services set forth in Section 2.1(a)(iii), the excess of the
Additional Capital Contributions made by Leucadia, Inc. over the expenses of the
LLC (to the extent not reimbursed by Clients) to John W. Jordan II and David W.
Zalaznick in such proportions as they may agree but not in excess of $625,000
per calendar quarter of 1990, $687,500 per calendar quarter of 1991 and $750,000
per calendar quarter of 1992 and thereafter. The Management Fee will be treated
by the LLC as a deduction. Any Managing Director is authorized to make the
payments set forth in this paragraph.

            The Managing Directors shall not receive any other compensation or
fee for services hereunder, except as provided for in this Agreement.

            (b) In 1991, the LLC acquired a controlling interest in Fannie May
Candy Company, a Chicago based candy manufacturer. The LLC will open a Chicago
office to allow the John W. Jordan II Revocable Trust, as a Managing



                                  39
<PAGE>
Director, to monitor the LLC's investment in Fannie May Candy Company as well as
to more closely monitor its continuing investment in Jordan Industries, Inc.,
which is headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. In order to
manage the LLC's increasing Chicago area business investments better, in 1991
Mr. Jordan relocated his permanent residence from New York to Illinois. The
LLC's continued New York business interests, however, requires Mr. Jordan
periodically to return to New York. In recognition of the additional expenses
incurred by Mr. Jordan on behalf of the LLC in maintaining a New York place of
abode for this purpose, and in order to facilitate Mr. Jordan's New York
business trips, as compensation for the expenses Mr. Jordan incurs in continuing
to maintain a New York place of abode for LLC business purposes, it is hereby
agreed that for purposes of Section 6.1(a) hereof, Messrs. Jordan and Zalaznick
agree that the LLC shall pay to Mr. Jordan the first $250,000 of the Management
Fee per calendar year commencing in calendar 1992, with the balance of the
Management Fee to be allocated as agreed upon by Messrs. Jordan and Zalaznick
pursuant to Section 6.1(a). The allocation of $250,000 of the Management Fee
pursuant to this subsection 6.1(b) will be reviewed annually.

other ordinary operating costs and expenses.

            (b) Messrs. Jordan and Zalaznick shall be reimbursed for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in discharging their
functions and responsibilities hereunder.

            (c) The expenses of the LLC, including the management fee, shall be
paid from the Additional Capital Contributions, to the extent thereof.

                         DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENT


            THIS DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into on December 8, 1998 by and between LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION, a
New York corporation (the "Company"), and Joseph S. Steinberg (the "Executive"),
collectively the parties ("Parties").

                                   WITNESSETH:

            WHEREAS, Executive is employed by the Company as President; and

            WHEREAS, in connection with the provision of services to the Company
in his capacity as President the Executive desires to defer the receipt of
certain compensation from the Company to which in the future he may become
entitled, and the Company agrees to do so, in accordance with the terms and
provisions herein contained;

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

            1.    Deferral of Payments.

                  The Company, commencing January 1, 1999 for the calendar year
ending December 31, 1999, shall defer the payment of all compensation to be paid
to the Executive by the Company attributable to services performed or to be
performed by the Executive for the Company at any time. Each deferred payment
shall accrue simple interest (on the basis of a 360-day year), from the first
day of the month immediately following the date on which payment otherwise would
have been made if no deferral had existed (the "First New Month Date") until the
date of actual payment, at a rate of interest equal to the 1-year Treasury bill
rate in effect at each First New Month Date, and the rate of interest shall be
reset on the first day of each subsequent quarter. For purposes hereof, the
quarters for calendar year 1999 shall begin January 1, April 1, July 1, and
October 1.

      All amounts deferred pursuant to this Agreement, including interest, shall
be payable to the Executive in calendar year 2000 by no later than March 15th of
that year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent that the
aggregate deferred payments hereunder (including interest) exceed the maximum
annual amount deductible as compensation by the Company under applicable U.S.
federal




NYFS04...:\30\76830\0198\1651\AGRD018J.41B
<PAGE>
tax laws, the Company may make such payments in two or more installments in
different taxable years to permit the Company to obtain the maximum annual
deduction available.

            The Executive shall fully reimburse the Company for the dollar value
of any benefits provided by the Company to the Executive during calendar year
1999 which, in the absence of such reimbursement obligation, would be taxable as
compensation to the Executive if made available to him by the Company without
such obligation. Such benefits would include, without limitation, the personal
use by the Executive of a Company car, Company airplane, life insurance
premiums, etc. This reimbursement shall include an interest component equal to
the minimum rate permitted to avoid the imposition of any interest under Section
7872 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Amounts to be reimbursed
to the Company under this paragraph shall be paid by Executive upon demand
therefor by the Company, which shall be made in 2000 as promptly as practicable
following availability of the Company's audited financial statements for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.

            The rights of the Executive to the payment of the amounts pursuant
to this Agreement shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured general
creditor of the Company and may not be assigned, pledged or otherwise
transferred by him during his lifetime to any person, whether by operation of
law or otherwise, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar
proceeding. By written notice delivered to the Company, the Executive may
designate (or change a prior designation of) one or more beneficiaries (or his
estate) to receive payment hereunder in the event of his death.

            2.    Withholding.

                  The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall
be entitled to withhold from his compensation all federal, state, local or other
taxes which the Company determines are required to be withheld on amounts
payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. The Executive
further agrees to indemnify the Company and hold it harmless from and against
any and all taxes (and penalties thereon) and interest with respect thereto
arising out of the Executive's failure to pay fully his tax liability pursuant
to any present or future law, regulation or ordinance of the United States of
America or any state, city or municipality therein.

            3.    Governing Law.

                  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in

            4.    Entire Agreement.

Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements, understandings and arrangements, both oral and written,
between the Parties hereto with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement
may not be modified in any manner, except by a written instrument signed by both
the Company and the Executive.

            5.    Notices.

                  Any notice required or permitted to be given under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when

Executive only as provided herein. At any time, by notice in writing from the
Executive to the Company, the Executive may terminate this Agreement whereupon
any compensation earned by the Executive subsequent to such notification shall
not be subject to the provisions hereof. Amounts earned prior to any such
notification shall remain subject to the terms hereof even after such
termination.

            7.    Benefit; Binding Effect.

            This Agreement shall be for the benefit of and binding upon the
Parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, legal
representatives, successors and, where applicable, assigns.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed and delivered

<PAGE>
shall have the right to review such balance sheets and calculation of the
Statutory Capital of the Company and ILIC and comment thereon for a period of 45
days after receipt thereof. Seller agrees that Buyer and its accountants may
have access to the accounting records of Seller relating to its preparation of
the Proposed Balance Sheets and calculation of the Statutory Capital of the
Company and ILIC for the purpose of conducting their review. Any changes in the

into final balance sheets of the Companies as of the Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the "Final Balance Sheets") and a final calculation

Balance Sheets. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on the
manner in which any item or items should be treated in the preparation of the
Final Balance Sheets or calculation of the Statutory Capital of the Company and
ILIC within such 45-day period, separate written reports of such item or items
shall be made in concise form and shall be referred to Arthur Anderson LLP (the
"Third Party Accountant"). The Third Party Accountant shall determine within 14
days the manner in which such item or items shall be treated on the Final
Balance Sheets or calculation of the Statutory Capital of the Company and ILIC,
as the case may be; provided, however, that the dollar amount of each item in
dispute shall be determined between the range of dollar amounts proposed by
Seller and Buyer, respectively. The determinations by the Third Party Accountant
as to the items in dispute shall be in writing and shall be binding and
conclusive on Seller and Buyer and shall be so reflected in the Final Balance
Sheets and the calculation of the Statutory Capital of the Company and ILIC. The
fees, costs and expenses of retaining the Third Party Accountant shall be
allocated by the Third Party Accountant between Seller and Buyer, in accordance
with the Third Party Accountant's judgment as to the relative merits of Seller's
and Buyer's proposals in respect of the disputed items. Such determination shall
be binding and conclusive on Seller and Buyer. Following the resolution of all
disputed items, Seller shall prepare the Final Balance Sheets and calculation of
the Statutory Capital of the Company and ILIC and shall deliver copies of such
balance sheets and such calculation to Buyer.

                  (c) In the event the aggregate amount of the Statutory Capital
of the Company and ILIC reflected on the Closing Balance Sheets is less than the
amount of the Statutory Capital of the Company and ILIC reflected on the Final
Balance Sheets, Buyer shall transfer to Seller additional cash in the amount of
such difference, together with interest thereon from and including the Closing
Date to but not including the date of such transfer computed at an annual rate
equal to the 90-day Treasury rate in effect on the Closing Date. In the event
the aggregate amount of the Statutory Capital of the Company and ILIC reflected
on the Closing Balance Sheets is more than the amount of the Statutory Capital
of the Company and ILIC reflected on the


                                       10
<PAGE>
Final Balance Sheets, Seller shall transfer to Buyer cash in the amount of such
difference, together with interest thereon computed at the annual rate as
specified above from and including the Closing Date to but not including the
date of such transfer. Any transfer of cash required under this Section 2.5(c)
shall be made within ten Business Days of the date of the delivery of the Final
Balance Sheets and calculation of the Statutory Capital of the Company and ILIC

conversion), to such qualification and administration, and except for any such
characterizations as a "modified endowment contract" that individually or in the
aggregate do not have and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material

or ILIC) or (ii) which question the validity of this Agreement or any action
taken by Seller, the Company or ILIC pursuant to this Agreement or the

<PAGE>
Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred that, with or without notice or lapse
of time or both, could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
suspension, lapse or limitation of any of such Insurance Licenses. Neither the
Company nor ILIC has transacted any insurance business in any jurisdiction
requiring an insurance license therefor in which it did not possess such an
insurance license, other than those that the failure to own or hold individually
or in the aggregate with other such failures do not have and cannot reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 4.11(b) sets forth a
true, correct and complete list of the lines of insurance which each of the
Company and ILIC is authorized to write in each of the respective jurisdictions
set forth on Schedule 4.1.

                  4.12. Regulatory Filings. Each of the Company and ILIC has
filed all reports, data, registrations, filings, other information and

Authorities with jurisdiction over the Company or ILIC, as the case may be, or
its business, Properties or assets, in each case except such failures to file
that individually or in the aggregate do not have and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and all required regulatory
approvals in respect thereof are in full force and effect in all material
respects. All such regulatory filings were in compliance in all material
respects with applicable Laws, and no material deficiencies have been asserted
by any such Governmental Authority with respect to such regulatory filings that
have not been satisfied.

                  4.13. Contracts. (a) Schedule 4.13(a) sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of each Contract (collectively, the "Scheduled
Contracts") to which the Company or ILIC is a party or by which either is bound
that is currently in effect or is not otherwise terminable without penalty or
payment on not more than 30 days notice (other than direct insurance policies
written by the Company or ILIC in the ordinary course of business), including
all Contracts relating to: reinsurance or loss portfolio transfers; transactions
between Affiliates; managing general agents; agents and brokers; borrowing of
money; purchase of materials; supplies, equipment, products or services; the use
of trademarks, trade names or copyrights; distribution of insurance products; or
leases (capital or otherwise). The Scheduled Contracts which consist of
transactions under which the Company or ILIC previously sold Subsidiaries or
blocks of its business and under which the Company or ILIC retains
responsibilities, obligations and/or potential liability are set forth on
Schedule 4.13(b) (the "Prior Transactions"). The Scheduled Contracts which
Seller and Buyer have agreed will be terminated as to the Company and/or ILIC,
as applicable, as of the Closing Date are set forth on Schedule 4.13(c).

                  (b) With respect to either the Company's or ILIC's performance
of its obligations under the Scheduled Contracts, no event of default or
non-compliance, or event which with the passage of time, giving of notice or
both, would


                                       19
<PAGE>
constitute such an event of default or non-compliance, has occurred or is
continuing under any such Scheduled Contract. With respect to the performance by
any other party of its obligations under the Scheduled Contracts, to the
Knowledge of Seller, no event of default or non-compliance, or event which with
the passage of time, giving of notice or both, would constitute such an event of
default or non-compliance, has occurred or is continuing under any such
Scheduled Contract.

                  4.14. Finder's Fees. No broker or finder has acted directly or
indirectly for Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, nor has Seller or any of its Affiliates
taken any action in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby so as to give rise to any valid claim against Buyer, the
Company or ILIC for any broker's or finder's fee or other commission or
compensation.

                  4.15. Statutory Statements. (a) Seller has delivered to Buyer

the Missouri Insurance Department for the quarterly period ended September 30,
1998, (iii) the Annual Statements of ILIC as filed with the New York Insurance

the quarterly period ended September 30, 1998, in each case including all
exhibits, interrogatories, schedules and any actuarial opinions, affirmations or
certifications or other supporting documents filed in connection therewith
(collectively, the "Statutory Statements"). The Statutory Statements were
prepared in conformity with SAP prescribed or permitted by the Missouri
Insurance Department with respect to the Statutory Statements of the Company and
the New York Insurance Department with respect to the Statutory Statements of
ILIC, and present fairly the respective statutory financial positions of the
Company and ILIC as at the respective dates thereof and the respective results
of operations of the Company and ILIC for the respective periods then ended. The
Statutory Statements complied in all material respects with all applicable laws,
rules and regulations when filed, and no material deficiency has been asserted
with respect to any Statutory Statements by any Governmental Authority.

                  (b) The amounts shown in the Statutory Statements as reserves
and liabilities for past and future insurance policy and annuity benefits,
losses, claims and expenses under insurance policies and annuities as of the end
of each such year were determined in accordance with generally accepted
actuarial standards consistently applied, were fairly stated in accordance with
sound actuarial principles, were based on actuarial assumptions that were
appropriate for obligations of the Company and ILIC, respectively, and met the
requirements of SAP.

becomes aware of prior to the


                                       28
<PAGE>
Closing Date that would (i) make any of the representations and warranties of

obligations under this Agreement in a timely manner. Buyer shall also promptly

by law, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall allow the other party three Business Days or such shorter amount of time
as is practicable under the circumstances to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance.

                  7.1. Tax Returns Filed and Taxes Paid by Seller. Seller
represents and warrants to Buyer that: (i) all Tax Returns required to be filed
by Seller, the Company or ILIC on or


                                       30
<PAGE>

all such Tax Returns are true, complete and correct in all material respects;
(ii) all Taxes payable by Seller, the Company or ILIC attributable to the
Company or ILIC that are or were due and payable on or before the Closing Date

Company and ILIC in accordance with applicable accounting practices consistently
applied; (iii) except as set forth on Schedule 7.1, no deficiencies for any

neither the Company, ILIC nor any member of Seller's Group has been notified in
writing by any taxing authority of any audit or investigation with respect to

Company or ILIC and with respect to which the applicable statute of limitations
has not expired; (v) except as set forth on Schedule 7.1, there are no
agreements in effect to extend the period of limitations for the assessment or
collection of any Tax imposed on the income, operations or assets of the Company

of which the Company and ILIC are members and will file a federal consolidated

                  7.2. Seller's Non-Foreign Status. Seller is not a foreign
person within the meaning of Section 1445(f)(3) of the Code.

                  7.3. Post-Closing Access to Books and Records and Cooperation.
Buyer will cause the Company and ILIC after the Closing to afford, or will
itself afford, to Seller and its representatives and agents reasonable access
during normal business hours (on terms not unreasonably disruptive to the
business, operations or employees of Buyer, the Company or ILIC) to the Books
and Records pertaining to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and to
the Company's and ILIC's employees and auditors for the purpose of obtaining
information relating to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, to the
extent such access is reasonably necessary as determined by Seller: (i) to
prepare and complete any Tax or other regulatory filings required to be made by

Company or ILIC any inquiry, assessment, contest, proceeding or litigation
("Contest") controlled by Seller under Section 7.4.7 of this Agreement; (iii) to

                                       31
<PAGE>
of Seller which is reasonable under the circumstances. Seller will hold all
information provided to it pursuant to this Section 7.3 (and any information
derived therefrom) in confidence (except to the extent it otherwise becomes
public other than through actions of Seller) and will not disclose any such
information other than (i) as is reasonably necessary in connection with the
Contest or (ii) as required by applicable law or regulation. Buyer will hold
Seller's requests for information, and the contents of Buyer's responses
thereto, in confidence (except to the extent such information otherwise becomes
public other than through the actions of Buyer) and will not disclose any such
information other than (i) to directors, officers, employees, and agents of
Buyer who need to know such information for the purposes for which it was
requested or provided and (ii) as required by applicable law or regulation.

                  7.4.  Liability for Taxes and Related Matters.

                        7.4.1.  Seller's Liability for Taxes.  Except
as provided otherwise in the last sentence of this Section 7.4.1., and except as
otherwise provided in Section 7.5, Seller shall be liable for and shall
indemnify Buyer for all Taxes, (including any obligation imposed on Buyer, the
Company or ILIC to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a
consolidated, combined or unitary basis with respect to a group of corporations
that includes or included the Company or ILIC, and Taxes resulting from the
Company or ILIC ceasing to be members of Seller's Group) to the extent, and only
to the extent, any such Tax is (A) imposed on Seller's Group for any taxable
year and (B) imposed on the Company or ILIC or for which the Company or ILIC may
otherwise be liable (1) for any taxable year or period that ends on or before
the Closing Date, (2) with respect to any taxable year or period beginning
before and ending after the Closing Date, for the portion of such taxable year
or period ending on the Closing Date as determined in accordance with the
principles set forth in Section 7.4.3, (3) arising out of a breach or inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty contained in Section 7.1 (assuming that each
representation and warranty qualified by the terms "material" or "Material
Adverse Effect" were not so qualified), or (4) arising out of a breach of any
covenant contained in this Article 7, in each case, only to the extent in excess
of the aggregate amounts reserved for Taxes on the Final Balance Sheets. Buyer
may not, without Seller's consent, amend any Tax Return of the Company or ILIC
for any taxable period including any portion of time on or prior to the Closing
Date. Seller shall be entitled to a refund of Taxes of the Company or ILIC
received for any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date;
provided, however, that any refund for such periods that results from a
carryback of any loss, deduction or other tax benefit attributable to the
Company or ILIC with respect to a period subsequent to the Closing Date shall be
paid to or retained by the Company, ILIC or Buyer, as the case may be; provided,
further, that if, and only if, any such refund that results from such carryback
affects Seller's ability to obtain a refund for any pre-Closing taxable year or


                                       32
<PAGE>
period, the Company, ILIC or Buyer, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
only fifty percent (50%) of such refund and Seller shall be entitled to the
balance of such refund. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section
7.4.1. or anywhere else in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall in any way alter or affect Buyer's (and its Affiliate's,
excluding the Company or ILIC) obligation and ultimate responsibility to pay or
reimburse the Company (and, thereby, indirectly Seller) any and all amounts of
DAC Taxes and premium Taxes as provided in (A) the Charter Coinsurance
Agreement, (B) the Charter Reinsurance Agreement and (C) the ILIC Coinsurance
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be construed so as not to
subvert or alter such obligations or responsibilities of Buyer and its
Affiliates; provided, however, that no payment to Seller or Seller's Affiliates
shall be required for any Tax attributable to a period after the Closing unless
Seller or its Affiliates is required to make a payment of any such Tax;
provided, further, that no payment to Seller or Seller's Affiliates shall be
required for any amounts of such DAC Taxes or premium Taxes reflected as an
asset or a reduction of a liability (net of any offset) on the Final Balance
Sheets, and only to the extent such amounts, as so reflected on the Final
Balance Sheets, are taken into account in determining Statutory Capital.

                        7.4.2.  Buyer's Liability for Taxes.  Buyer
shall be liable for and shall indemnify Seller for the Taxes of the Company and
ILIC (i) for any taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date, (ii)
with respect to any taxable year or period beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date, for the portion of such taxable year beginning after the Closing
Date as determined in accordance with the principles set forth in Section 7.4.3,
(iii) for any amount for which the Company, ILIC, Buyer or any successor of any
of them remains responsible under Section 7.5, (iv) for amounts that are the
responsibility of Buyer or its Affiliates (or successors) under the Charter
Coinsurance Agreement, the Charter Reinsurance Agreement and the ILIC
Coinsurance Agreement, to the extent such amounts are not reflected as an asset
or a reduction of a liability on the Final Balance Sheets, and only to the
extent such amounts, as so reflected on the Final Balance Sheets, are taken into
account in determining Statutory Capital, and (v) arising out of a breach of any
covenant contained in this Article 7. Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of
Taxes of the Company or ILIC for the periods referred to in clauses (i) and (ii)
of the preceding sentence.

                        7.4.3.  Taxes for Short Taxable Year.  Seller
and Buyer shall close the taxable period of the Company and ILIC as of the close
of business on the Closing Date, unless such action is prohibited by Law. In any
case where applicable law prohibits the Company or ILIC from closing its taxable
year on the Closing Date then, for purposes of Sections 7.4.1, 7.4.2 and 7.4.6,
the determination of the Taxes of the Company and ILIC for the portion of the
year or period ending on, and the portion of


                                       33
<PAGE>
the year or period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined on the
basis of an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be
ratably apportioned on a time basis. The parties hereto expressly recognize that
the allocation of Taxes in the preceding sentence will be determined by
allocating any provision of reserves on the basis of an interim closing of the
books. Seller shall be responsible for Taxes allocable according to this
paragraph to the portion of such year ending on the Closing Date only to the
extent such Taxes exceed the aggregate amount reserved for Taxes on the Final
Balance Sheets.

                        7.4.4.  Adjustment to Purchase Price.  Any
payment by Buyer or Seller under Section 7.4 will be an adjustment to the
Purchase Price unless a determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code,
except that no appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court shall be required) with respect
to such payment causes any such payment not to constitute an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for income tax purposes.

                        7.4.5.  Pre-Closing Taxes.  Seller shall
(i) timely prepare and file all Tax Returns of the Company and ILIC required to
be filed for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
timely pay or cause to be paid any Tax due thereon. Seller shall prepare such
Tax Returns on a basis consistent with past practices. In the case of any such
Tax Return required to be signed by the Company or ILIC, Seller shall provide
such Tax Returns to Buyer at least 5 Business Days prior to the due date,
including any extensions for the filing thereof, together with such tax
information reasonably relevant to such Tax Returns (including any supporting
schedules, workpapers and information as to the method of computing separate
taxable income or other relevant measure of income of the Company and ILIC), and
Buyer shall cause the Company or ILIC, as the case may be, duly to execute such
Return and return it to Seller at least three Business Days prior to the due
date thereof. Notwithstanding this Section 7.4.5, liability for the Taxes due on
such Tax Returns shall be determined in accordance with the other provisions of
this Article 7.

                        7.4.6.  Post-Closing Taxes.  (a)  Buyer shall
(i) timely prepare and file all Tax Returns of the Company and ILIC required to
be filed for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date and (ii) timely
pay or cause to be paid any Tax due thereon.

                  (b) Buyer shall timely prepare and file all Tax Returns of the
Company and ILIC required to be filed for any taxable period beginning prior to
the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date. Liability for the Taxes due
on such Tax Returns shall be determined in accordance with the principles set
forth in Section 7.4.3.


                                       34
<PAGE>
                  (c) The provisions of this Section 7.4.6(c) shall apply to all
Taxes and Tax Returns covered by this Article 7. Buyer and Seller shall share
information and cooperate in all matters (including securing proper signatures)
related to the filing of Tax Returns. In cases where one party prepares a Tax
Return (the "Preparer") but another party is liable for part of the Tax on such
Tax Return (the "Liable Party"), the Preparer shall pay the appropriate amount
of Tax to the taxing authority and provide written notice requesting payment of
the portion of Tax due from the Liable Party. Such notice shall be provided at
least 10 Business Days prior to the due date of the Tax Return (including any
extensions for the filing thereof) and shall include the Tax Return together
with such Tax information reasonably relevant to such Tax Return, including
supporting schedules, workpapers and information as to the method of computing
separate taxable income or other relevant measure of income of the Company and
ILIC. Payment from the Liable Party to the Preparer shall be made within 7
Business Days of the receipt of such written notice, provided, however, that
payment shall not be due prior to three Business Days before the time the Tax
payment is due to the taxing authority. If the parties do not agree on the
amount of the payment, the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in Section
2.5(b) shall be utilized. Any late payment of Tax from the Liable Party to the
Preparer shall bear interest at the overpayment rate set forth in Section
6621(a)(1) of the Code.

                  7.4.7. Contest Provisions. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller
in writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of Buyer's Affiliates or Subsidiaries, the
Company or ILIC of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or
foreign Tax audits or assessments which may affect the Tax liabilities of the
Company or ILIC for which Seller could be required to indemnify Buyer pursuant
to Section 7.4.1 (assuming, for this purpose, no exception to or limitation on
such indemnity obligation attributable to the existence of any reserve for Taxes
on the Final Balance Sheet), provided that failure to comply with this provision
shall not affect Buyer's right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent
such failure results in an increase in the amount for which Seller is liable
under Section 7.4.1 or otherwise results in a Loss to Seller or a Seller
Affiliate. Seller shall have the sole right to represent and control the
Company's and ILIC's interests in any Contest relating to taxable periods ending
on or before the Closing Date, or relating to any claim for Taxes which could be
subject to indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section 7.4.1. other than Taxes
described in the next paragraph, and to employ counsel of its choice at its
expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to settle
after the Closing Date, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes which would materially adversely affect the
liability for Taxes of Buyer, the Company or ILIC for any period (including, but
not limited to, the imposition of income tax deficiencies, the reduction of
asset basis or cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or
depreciation periods, the


                                       35
<PAGE>
denial of amortization or depreciation deductions or the reduction of loss or
credit carryforwards) without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall not be necessary to the extent
that Seller has indemnified Buyer against the effects of any such settlement.

            Seller shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the
defense of any claim for Taxes for a year or period ending after the Closing
Date which may be subject to indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section 7.4.1
and, with the written consent of Buyer and at its sole expense, may assume the
entire defense of such Tax claim if assumption of such defense is permitted by
law. Neither Buyer, the Company, nor ILIC may agree to settle any Tax claim for
the portion of the year or period ending on the Closing Date which may be the
subject of indemnification by Seller under Section 7.4.1 without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Buyer shall have the sole right to represent the Company's or ILIC's interests
in the defense of any claim for Taxes relating to taxable periods beginning on
or after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be
entitled to settle after the Closing Date, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which would materially adversely
affect the liability for Taxes of Seller, the Company or ILIC for any period for
which Seller must indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 7.4.1 (including, but not
limited to, the imposition of income tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset
basis or cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation
periods, the denial of amortization or depreciation deductions or the reduction
of loss or credit carryforwards) without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall not be necessary to
the extent that Buyer has indemnified Seller against the effects of any such
settlement.

                  7.5. Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax
sharing agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or involving the
Company or ILIC shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence or anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company,
ILIC and Buyer (and any successor thereto) shall continue to be obligated, even
after the Closing Date, to pay Seller any amounts owing under the Tax Allocation
Agreements for any amount of Taxes for which a reserve or accrual has been
established and reflected on the Final Balance Sheets.

                  7.6. Section 338(h)(10) Election. (a) Buyer and Seller shall
make a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and under any
comparable or equivalent provisions of state or local law with respect to the
purchase of the Shares by Buyer (the "Election"). Seller and Buyer shall report,
in connection with the determination of Taxes, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Election, including the
reasonable determination of the fair market value of the assets of the Company
and ILIC and the


                                       36
<PAGE>
allocation of the deemed purchase price among the assets of the Company and ILIC
within the meaning of Section 338(h)(10) of the Code.

                  (b) Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing
of all forms and documents required in connection with the Election. In
connection with the Election, not later than 20 Business Days prior to the
required due date thereof, Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of (i) a
properly executed Form 8023 (or any successor form), (ii) all attachments
required to be filed therewith pursuant to the Code and (iii) any comparable
forms and attachments with respect to any applicable state or local elections
being made pursuant to the Election. Seller shall execute and deliver to Buyer
within 120 days of the required due date therefor, such documents or forms as
are required by any Tax laws to properly complete the Election. Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate fully with each other and make available to each other such Tax
data and other information as may be reasonably required by Seller or Buyer in
order to prepare any documents, forms, or information, or to timely file the
Election and any other required statements or schedules. Buyer shall promptly
execute and deliver to Seller any amendments made to Form 8023 (or any successor
form) (and any comparable state and local forms) subsequent to the filing of the
Election and any attachments which are required to be filed under applicable
law, including any amendments to Form 8023 (or any successor form) necessitated
by any indemnification payments made pursuant to Section 8.1 or 7.4.1.

                  (c) Buyer shall comply with all of the requirements of Section
338(h)(10) of the Code. Seller shall take no action which is inconsistent with
the requirements for filing the Election under the Code.

                  (d) To the extent permitted by state or local laws, the
principles and procedures of this Section 7.6 shall also apply with respect to a
Section 338(h)(10) election or equivalent or comparable provision under state or
local law.

                  (e) Buyer shall have no liability to Seller for, and shall not
be deemed to have indemnified, under any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, Seller from and against, for or in respect of, any Taxes which may be
imposed upon or assessed against Seller as a result of the Election.

                  7.7. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Obligations.
The representations, warranties and obligations of the parties set forth in this
Article 7 shall survive the Closing, shall be unconditional and absolute and
shall remain in effect, in each case, until termination of the applicable period
of limitations with respect to Taxes, plus 90 days.

                  7.8. Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall be liable for and shall pay
all excise, sales, use, transfer (including real property transfer or gains),
stamp, documentary, filing,


                                       37
<PAGE>
recordation and other similar taxes which may be imposed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any transfer taxes
imposed by reason of the Section 338(h)(10) election), together with any
interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto. Each party hereto hereby
agrees to file all necessary documentation (including, but not limited to, all
Tax Returns) with respect to all such amounts in a timely manner.

                  7.9. Continuation of Reinsurance Agreements. Buyer expressly
covenants that the Charter Coinsurance Agreement, the Charter Reinsurance
Agreement and the ILIC Coinsurance Agreement will continue in full force and
effect until at least the day after the Closing Date.

                  7.10. Indemnification Payments Net of any Tax Benefit.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if any payment by one
party to the other party with respect to a single item under this Article 7 or
under Article 8 hereof exceeds (or would exceed but for this Section 7.10)
$25,000, the amount of such payment shall be reduced by the amount of any tax
benefit actually realized or reasonably expected to be realized by the payee as
a result of either the payment or the circumstances underlying or giving rise to
the payment, provided, however, any such tax benefit shall be reduced by any tax
cost resulting to the payee as a result of the receipt of such indemnity
payment.

            8.    INDEMNIFICATION.

                  8.1. Indemnification by Seller. (a) Subject to the provisions
of Sections 8.3 and 8.5 and Article 10 of this Agreement, Seller hereby agrees
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, the Company and ILIC and their
respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, agents, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against, for and in
respect of any and all Losses which any of them may sustain based upon, arising
out of or otherwise in respect of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement (other than the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in Article 7, the
indemnification obligations of which are governed by Article 7) or in any
schedule, certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant hereto
(assuming that each representation and warranty qualified by the terms
"material" or "Material Adverse Effect" were not so qualified and without regard
to the Knowledge of Seller), (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of
Seller contained in this Agreement (other than the covenants of Seller contained
in Article 7, the indemnification obligations of which are governed by Article
7), (iii) any matter relating to or arising out of the Prior Transactions
(including any indemnification obligations (including product tax compliance
indemnification obligations and indemnification obligations for any liability
arising from the Teter lawsuit set forth on Schedule 4.10) of the Company or
ILIC


                                       38
<PAGE>
with respect thereto), (iv) any matter relating to or arising out of Market
Conduct Activities arising as a result of any acts, errors or omissions prior to
the Closing Date by the Company or ILIC, any of their respective Affiliates or
any of their respective officers, employees, agents or representatives, (v) any
guaranty fund assessments for insolvencies occurring prior to the Closing Date
to the extent such assessments are not reflected on the Final Balance Sheets,
(vi) any liability of the Company or ILIC incurred on or before the Closing
Date, not paid as of such date and not reflected on the Final Balance Sheets or
(vii) the failure of any policies listed on Schedule 4.9(a) to qualify as "life
insurance contracts" under, and to be administered in accordance with, Section
101 or Section 7702 of the Code, or the characterization of any such contract as
a "modified endowment contract" within the meaning of Section 7702A of the Code,
except for any such contract that qualifies and is administrated as a modified
endowment contract, and with respect to which the policyholder acknowledged and
agreed, before the date of issuance of such contract (or if any such contract
became a modified endowment contract upon conversion subsequent to the date of
issuance, before the date of conversion), to such qualification and
administration. Notwithstanding anything in Article 7 or this Article 8 to the
contrary, in no event shall Seller be obligated to indemnify, defend or hold
harmless any Buyer Indemnitee with respect to (i) any Losses arising as a result
of any acts, errors or omissions by Buyer or Allstate NY, or any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer or Allstate NY and any
breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer or Allstate NY contained in (A) the
Charter Coinsurance Agreement, (B) the Charter Reinsurance Agreement, (C) the
Administrative Service Agreement, dated as of September 2, 1998, between Buyer
and the Company, (D) the ILIC Coinsurance Agreement, (E) the Administrative
Services Agreement, dated as of September 2, 1998, between Allstate NY and ILIC,
and (F) the Purchase Agreement or (ii) any Policy Liabilities (as such term is
used in the Charter Coinsurance Agreement, the Charter Reinsurance Agreement and
the ILIC Coinsurance Agreement); provided, however, that all obligations and
responsibilities of Seller under the Purchase Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect without regard to this Agreement.

                  (b) For purposes hereof, "Loss" and/or "Losses" shall mean any
and all losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs or expenses, including
interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and
disbursements, after deducting all amounts received by the indemnified party as
a recovery under any insurance policy or bond. Without limiting the generality
thereof, Losses arising out of or related to Market Conduct Activities include:
the cost to the Indemnified Party of any obligation (whether arising out of a
judgment or a settlement) to increase crediting rates, to credit cash or other
account values, to provide one or more additional coverages, to forgive future
premium payments, to make a policy loan at a discount from contractual rates, or
to provide any other benefits to current or former policyholders; the costs


                                       39
<PAGE>
of administering a global settlement, including costs of communicating with
policyholders; the costs of any individualized arbitration process provided for
as part of a settlement or judgment, including all costs of administering such a
process and of awards granted therein; the costs of any employees or facilities
to the extent dedicated to devising or facilitating a settlement; and the fees
and expenses of counsel for third parties agreed or required to be paid by the
Indemnified Party.

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by Buyer of notice of (i) any
demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would give rise to
a Loss with respect to which a Buyer Indemnitee would be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.1 or (ii) any claim or the
commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or
investigation (an "Asserted Liability") that may result in a Loss with respect
to which a Buyer Indemnitee would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 8.1, Buyer shall give notice thereof to Seller, describing in
reasonable detail such demand, claim, circumstances or Asserted Liability, the
provision or provisions under this Agreement under which the right to
indemnification is asserted and the specific circumstances thereof, and
indicating the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may
be suffered by such Buyer Indemnitee in connection therewith. Buyer's failure to
give notice of any such demand, claim, circumstances or Asserted Liability to
Seller in a prompt manner will not be deemed a waiver of the Buyer Indemnitee's
right to indemnification hereunder for Losses in connection herewith, but the
amount of indemnification to which the Buyer Indemnitee is entitled shall be
reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Buyer Indemnitee's Losses would have
been less had such notice been given promptly.

                  8.2. Buyer's Obligation to Indemnify. (a) Subject to the
provisions of Section 8.3 and 8.5 and Article 10 of this Agreement, Buyer hereby
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and Seller's officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates, agents, successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against, for and in respect of any and all
Losses which any of them may sustain based upon, arising out of or otherwise in
respect of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any schedule, certificate, instrument or
other document delivered pursuant hereto (assuming that each representation and
warranty qualified by the terms "material" or "material adverse effect" were not
so qualified and without regard to the Knowledge of Buyer), or (ii) any breach
of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement (other than
the covenant of Buyer contained in Article 7, the indemnification obligations of
which are governed by Article 7).

                  (b) Promptly after receipt by Seller of notice of (i) any
demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would give rise to
a Loss with respect to which a Seller Indemnitee would be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this


                                       40
<PAGE>
Section 8.2 or (ii) an Asserted Liability that may result in a Loss with respect
to which a Seller Indemnitee would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 8.2, Seller shall give notice thereof to Buyer, describing in
reasonable detail such demand, claim, circumstances or Asserted Liability, the
provision or provisions under this Agreement under which the right to
indemnification is asserted and the specific circumstances thereof, and
indicating the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may
be suffered by such Seller Indemnitee in connection therewith. Seller's failure
to give notice of any such demand, claim, circumstances or Asserted Liability to
Buyer in a prompt manner will not be deemed a waiver of the Seller Indemnitee's
right to indemnification hereunder for Losses in connection herewith, but the
amount of indemnification to which the Seller Indemnitee is entitled shall be
reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Seller Indemnitee's Losses would
have been less had such notice been given promptly.

                  8.3. Right to Contest Third Party Claims. (a) Defense
(including the right to settle or compromise) of any Asserted Liability,
including selection of counsel (subject to the consent of Buyer, for all Buyer
Indemnities or of Seller, for all Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the sole power to direct,
investigate and control such defense, shall be by the indemnifying party, if
within 30 days after receiving the notice required under Section 8.1(c) or
Section 8.2(b), as the case may be, the indemnifying party gives written notice
to Buyer on behalf of all Buyer Indemnities, or Seller on behalf of all Seller
Indemnitees, as the case may be, stating that the indemnifying party intends to
dispute and defend against such Asserted Liability at its own cost and expense.
The indemnified party shall make no payment in respect of such Asserted
Liability to any third party as long as the indemnifying party is conducting a
good faith and diligent defense.

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall at
all times have the right to fully participate in such defense at its own cost
and expense directly or through counsel. If no such notice of intent to dispute
and defend is given by the indemnifying party, or if such diligent good faith
defense is not being or ceases to be conducted, the Buyer on behalf of all Buyer
Indemnitees, or Seller on behalf of all Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, (x)
shall, at the expense of the indemnifying party, undertake the defense of such
Asserted Liability with one counsel selected by Buyer on behalf of all Buyer
Indemnities, or Seller on behalf of all Seller Indemnities, as applicable, and
(y) shall have the right to compromise or settle the same exercising reasonable
business judgment with the consent of the indemnifying party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            (c) Except as provided herein, Buyer on behalf of all Buyer
Indemnitees, and Seller on behalf of all Seller Indemnitees, as applicable,
shall have the right to consent to


                                       41
<PAGE>
any settlement or compromise of any Asserted Liability, which consent shall not
be withheld unreasonably. If the indemnified party refuses to consent to a bona
fide compromise or settlement that the indemnifying party desires to agree to
(the "Bona Fide Settlement"), the indemnified party may continue to pursue the
defense of such Asserted Liability, free of any participation by the
indemnifying party and at the sole expense of the indemnified party; provided
that in such event, the obligation of the indemnifying party to the indemnified
paty will equal the lesser of (i) the amount of such Bona Fide Settlement or
(ii) the actual out-of-pocket amount that the indemnified party is obligated to
pay as a result of the indemnified party's continued defense of such Asserted
Liability, plus the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
indemnified party after the date of notice from the indemnified party of its
refusal to consent to a Bona Fide Settlement (the "Refusal Date") in connection
with such Asserted Liability, minus the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
indemnifying party incurred after the Refusal Date by the indemnifying party in
connection with such Asserted Liability. The indemnifying party shall give the
indemnified party such notice of the Bona Fide Settlement as is reasonable under
then existing circumstances and the indemnified party shall notify the
indemnifying party of its consent or lack of consent to such Bona Fide
Settlement within a reasonable period of time under then existing circumstances.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the indemnifying party shall
have the right to settle all claims of third parties for which indemnification
is payable hereunder without the consent of the indemnified party so long as
such settlement releases the indemnified party from all liability for or in
connection with such action, is exclusively on monetary terms, does not
materially and adversely impair the ability of the indemnified party to carry on
its business and does not contain any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the
indemnified party.

            (d) The indemnified party shall make available all information and
assistance that the indemnifying party may reasonably request and shall
cooperate with the indemnifying party in such defense. Any failure to make
available such information and/or to cooperate shall reduce the amount, if any,
by which the indemnified party's Losses would have been reduced had such
information been made available or such cooperation been provided.

                  8.4. Indemnification for Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in
this Article 8 to the contrary, any indemnifiable Loss or third party claims
based on, attributable to or resulting from any misrepresentation or the breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Seller in Article 7, or
the failure to comply with any covenant or agreement on the part of the parties
hereto contained in Article 7, will be governed exclusively by Article 7.

                  8.5. Limitations on Indemnification. (a) If any party seeking
indemnification under this Article 8 (an


                                       42
<PAGE>
"indemnified party") recovers from any third party (including insurers) all or
any part of any amount paid to it by an indemnifying party (herein so called)
pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2, such indemnified party shall promptly pay over
to the indemnifying party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the
full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery, including
any taxes and net of any tax benefit resulting from such recovery and payment),
but not in excess of any amount previously so paid by the indemnifying party. If
an indemnified party recovers from any third party (including insurers) any
amount as to which indemnification may be claimed pursuant to Section 8.1 or
8.2, such indemnified party shall have no right to claim indemnification for
such amount from the indemnifying party.

            (b) The indemnified party shall prosecute diligently and in good
faith any claim for indemnification with any applicable third party (including
insurers), but such attempt shall not be a condition precedent to the
indemnified party seeking to collect any indemnification payment pursuant to
Section 8.1 or 8.2.

            9.    TERMINATION.

                  9.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing: (i) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer or (ii)
by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
June 30, 1999; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under Section 9.1(ii) will not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date.

                  9.2. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with
no liability on the part of any party hereto, except with respect to Section
11.8 and the confidentiality provisions set forth in Section 6.3 and except that
nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any prior breach of
this Agreement.

            10.   SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

            Notwithstanding any right of Buyer fully to investigate the affairs
of the Companies, Buyer has the right to rely fully upon the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement or in any other certificate or
instrument delivered at Closing. Each of the representations and warranties of
Seller and Buyer under this Agreement will survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Closing and remain in effect until the expiration of the
twenty-four month period immediately following the Closing Date, except that the
representations and warranties of Seller contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
4.4, 4.9, 4.13, 4.17 and 4.26 shall


                                       43
<PAGE>
survive the Closing and remain in effect indefinitely and the representations
and warranties of Seller contained in Article 7 shall survive the Closing and
remain in effect for the period set forth in Article 7.

            11.   MISCELLANEOUS.

                  11.1. Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be
amended, and none of its provisions may be modified, except expressly by an
instrument signed by the parties hereto. No failure or delay of a party in
exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. No waiver by a party of any provision of this Agreement or
consent to any departure therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by such party, and then such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for
which given.

                  11.2. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by either of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other party. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the
parties hereto and its respective successors and permitted assigns.

                  11.3. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the
Schedules hereto) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior
negotiations, commitments, agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof.

                  11.4. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
law).

                  11.5. Enforcement; Jurisdiction. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
the United States located in the State of New York or any state court sitting in
The City of New York, New York (any such federal or state court, a "New York
Court"), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
to in law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of any


                                       44
<PAGE>
such New York Court, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction or venue by motion or
other request for leave from any such New York Court and (iii) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a New York Court.

                  11.6. Notices. All written notices required under this
Agreement shall be given in writing and shall be deemed to have been given upon
(i) transmitter's confirmation of a receipt of a facsimile transmission, (ii)
confirmed delivery by a standard overnight carrier or when delivered by hand or

                  11.7. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the

invalid, void or unenforceable, each of Seller and Buyer direct that such court
interpret and apply the remainder of this Agreement in the manner that it

Agreement, and in doing so particularly take into account the relative
importance of the term, provision, covenant or restriction being held invalid,
void or unenforceable.

                                 TRUST AGREEMENT


            THIS TRUST AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made this 14th day of
August, 1998, between Leucadia National Corporation ("Leucadia") for the benefit
of its shareholders, and Joseph A.
Orlando (the "Trustee").

            WHEREAS, Leucadia is the beneficial owner of 4,117,986 shares of
common stock of HomeFed Corporation (the "Owned HomeFed Common Stock") which
represents approximately 41% of the outstanding shares of common stock of
HomeFed Corporation ("HomeFed Stock"); and

            WHEREAS, Leucadia has entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated
as of August 14, 1998 (the "Purchase Agreement"), among Leucadia and HomeFed
Corporation, pursuant to which Leucadia is entitled and obligated to purchase
for an aggregate purchase price of $6,670,100, a portion of which has already
been paid (the "Purchase Price") a number of additional shares of common stock
of HomeFed Corporation (the "Additional HomeFed Stock" and together with the
Owned HomeFed Stock, the "HomeFed Stock Interest") such that Leucadia would
beneficially own 87.5% of the outstanding shares of HomeFed Stock, ; and

            WHEREAS, Leucadia wishes to convey all of its right, title and
interest in and to the HomeFed Stock Interest and all of its right, title and

and account of the holders of common shares, par value $1.00 per share, of
Leucadia as of August 25, 1998 (the "Beneficiaries"); and

            WHEREAS, the Trustee has agreed to act as the Trustee under this
Agreement for the purposes herein provided;

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the

                                  THE TRUST

            Section 1.1 All of Leucadia's right, title and interest in and to
the Trust Property is hereby vested in the Trust. Any property that may in the
future be vested in the Trust pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall
thereafter also be considered Trust Property. To the extent any law or
regulation prohibits the transfer of ownership of any of the Trust Property from
Leucadia to the Trustee, the Trustee's interest shall be a lien upon and
security interest in such Trust Property, in trust, nevertheless, for the sole
use and purposes set forth in Section 2.1, and this Agreement shall be deemed a
security agreement granting such interest thereon.

            Section 1.2 Leucadia shall, upon reasonable request of the Trustee,
execute, acknowledge and deliver such further instruments and do such further
acts as may be necessary or appropriate to more effectively vest in the Trust
any portion of the Trust Property intended to be vested herein.


                                  ARTICLE 2

                            PURPOSES OF THE TRUST

            Section 2.1 The purposes of this Trust are (i) to hold the assets
transferred to it by Leucadia on behalf of the Beneficiaries and collect income
derived from such assets, (ii) to close the transaction contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, (iii) to take such other action as is necessary to conserve
and protect the Trust Property, and (iv) to liquidate and distribute the Trust
Property.


                                  ARTICLE 3

                              POWERS OF TRUSTEE

            Section 3.1 The Trustee accepts and undertakes to discharge the
Trust created by this Agreement upon the terms and conditions hereof and agrees,
for the benefit of the Beneficiaries, to exercise such of the rights and powers
vested in it by this Agreement in the same manner, and use the same degree of
care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise and use under
the circumstances in the conduct of



                                     2
<PAGE>
his own affairs, having due regard to the purposes of the Trust set forth in
Article 2 hereof.

            Section 3.2 In accepting the Trust hereby created, the Trustee acts
solely as Trustee hereunder, and all persons having any claim against the
Trustee in connection with its performance of its rights, powers and duties as
such Trustee shall only look to the Trust Property for payment or satisfaction
thereof.

            Section 3.3 The Trustee shall not commingle any of the Trust
Property with its own property or the property of any other person.

            Section 3.4 The Trustee is hereby empowered to:

            (a)   perform all of the obligations and agreements of the Trust 
      provided for in this Agreement;

            (b) make payment under the Purchase Agreement and perform any other
      obligations and agreements under the Purchase Agreement necessary for the
      issuance by HomeFed Corporation of the Additional HomeFed Stock;

            (c) keep and maintain an account in the name of the Trustee for the
      benefit of the Beneficiaries into which the Trustee shall deposit all
      Trust Property consisting of cash or cash equivalents (the "Trust
      Account"); the Trustee shall not permit any person other than the Trustee
      to have authority to make withdrawals from, or to issue drafts against,
      the Trust Account and no Trust Account may be maintained with any bank
      unless such bank has been furnished a copy of this Agreement;

      and others, to assist the Trustee in carrying out its duties hereunder;

            (f) receive additional Trust Property and take all appropriate
      action necessary to preserve the value of Trust Property as the Trustee in
      the reasonable exercise of its discretion shall determine, subject to
      Article 4 hereof;

<PAGE>
      Additional HomeFed Stock and any other shares of common stock of HomeFed
      Corporation that may then be Trust Property as directed in a written
      notice jointly signed by mutual agreement of Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S.
      Steinberg, each of whom is a Beneficiary of the Trust and, accordingly,
      are together thereby acting on behalf of all of the Beneficiaries;

            (h) pay all reasonable and necessary Trust expenses incurred in the
      administration of the Trust, including without limitation, attorneys' fees
      and disbursements, accounting fees, expert fees and other costs and
      expenses arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
      by the Purchase Agreement;

            (i) prepare and deliver written statements or notices, annually or
      otherwise, required by law to be delivered to Beneficiaries; provided that
      the Trustee shall have no obligation to deliver any statements or notices
      to a permitted transferee of a beneficial trust interest unless, prior to
      the date on which the statement or notice is required to be delivered, the
      Trustee receives (1) written notice adequately identifying the permitted
      transferee (including the transferee's name, address and tax
      identification number), and (2) reasonable evidence that the transfer was
      authorized by this Agreement;

            (j) to file and execute, on behalf of the Trust such applications,
      surety bonds, irrevocable consents, appointments of attorney for service
      of process and other papers and documents that shall be necessary or
      desirable to register or establish the exemption from registration of the
      HomeFed Stock Interest, and/or any additional shares of common stock of
      HomeFed Corporation that may become Trust Property, under the Securities
      Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and under state securities
      or blue sky laws and to otherwise assist in the registration of such
      shares of common stock of HomeFed Corporation;

            (k) maintain and preserve the originals of any and all instruments
      and documents pertaining to Trust Property; and

            (l) take any of the foregoing action, and execute any documents
      relating thereto, in the Trustee's own name, on behalf of the Trust.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Trustee
shall not, and is not empowered to, acquire any



                                     4
<PAGE>
property after the date hereof other than the Trust Property (and any proceeds
arising therefrom) or vary the investment of the Trust within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(c)(i).

            Section 3.5 The Trustee shall prepare or have prepared, and file on
behalf of the Trust all United States, federal, state and local income tax
returns and information returns required to be filed by the Trust, and shall
prepare and distribute to the Beneficiaries any reports regarding any income,
gain, deduction, credit or loss of the Trust as are required by applicable law
and, in addition thereto, as the Trustee in its sole discretion may from time to
time determine is appropriate or necessary to enable the Beneficiaries to
determine their respective tax obligations arising out of operations of the
Trust.

            Section 3.6 The Trustee may withhold from the amount distributable
from the Trust at any time to any person such sum or sums as may be sufficient
to pay any taxes which have been or may be imposed on such person or upon the
Trust with respect to the amount distributable or to be distributed under the
income tax laws of the United States or of any state or political subdivision or
entity by reason of any distribution provided for hereunder, wherever such
withholding is determined by the Trustee in its reasonable sole discretion to be
required.

            Section 3.7 The Trustee shall maintain records and books of account
relating to the Trust Property, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied and shall, at all reasonable times, permit any
authorized representative designated by a Beneficiary to have access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to inspect and/or copy (at
Beneficiary's expense payable at the time of copying), the financial records
relating to the Trust Property. The Trustee shall provide to each Beneficiary,
as soon as practicable after each anniversary of its creation and, in addition,
after termination of the Trust, an unaudited financial statement and a report
showing all transactions and the amounts thereof (including all sales or other
dispositions of Trust Property and expenses relating to the operation of the
Trust) consummated during the reporting period.

            Section 3.8 The Trustee may rely upon and shall be protected in
acting or refraining from acting upon any certificates, opinions, statements,
instruments or reports believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper person or persons; provided, however, that the



                                     5
<PAGE>
Trustee shall be under a duty to have examined the same to determine whether or
not such writings conform to the requirements of this Agreement.

            Section 3.9 The Trustee and its agents shall not be liable for any
error of business judgment or with respect to any action taken or omitted to be
taken by them in their capacity as Trustee or agent, unless it shall be proved
that the Trustee or its agents shall have been grossly negligent or shall have
acted with willful misconduct in ascertaining the pertinent facts or in
performing any of their rights, powers or duties hereunder. In the event such
liability is proven, the Beneficiaries shall be entitled to reimbursement of
their reasonable costs, including attorneys' fees and disbursements. The Trustee
makes no representations as to the value or condition of the Trust Property or
any part thereof, or as to the security afforded by this Agreement, or as to the
validity, execution (except its own execution), enforceability, legality or
sufficiency of this Agreement, and the Trustee shall incur no liability or
responsibility in respect of such matters.

            Section 3.10 The Trustee shall have no duty to accomplish any
recording, filing or registration of any instrument (including any financing or
continuation statement or any filing under tax or securities law) or any
rerecording, refiling or reregistration thereof.

            Section 3.11 The Trustee shall be indemnified by and receive
reimbursement from the Trust against and from any and all loss, liability, cost,
damage or expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, which
it may incur or sustain in the exercise and performance of any of its powers and
duties as such Trustee under this Agreement, unless such loss, liability, cost,
damage or expense shall be incurred or sustained as a result of the Trustee's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.


                                  ARTICLE 4

                   PERMITTED INVESTMENTS OF TRUST PROPERTY

            Section 4.1 The cash constituting the remainder of the Purchase
Price shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent
provided in Section 4.2, be invested by the Trustee as soon as practicable after
establishment of the Trust in state or local government securities with a
maturity date on or about June 15, 1999 and the income from which will not
result



                                     6
<PAGE>
in any federal tax liabilities to the Beneficiaries. All investments of Trust
Property shall be made in a manner such that the Trust will at all times be
classified as a grantor trust of which the Beneficiaries are the grantors for
United States federal income tax purposes (each such investment, a "Permitted
Investment"); provided, however, that (i) each Permitted Investment shall be
held solely in the name of the Trustee as Trustee, (ii) to the extent
practicable, the Trustee shall take physical possession of all such securities
and secure them in a safe deposit box registered solely in the name of the
Trustee as Trustee, and (iii) no Permitted Investment may be made unless the
Trustee shall furnish the bank or brokerage firm through which such Permitted
Investment is made with a copy of this Agreement, and such bank shall have
acknowledged to the Trustee in writing that upon the maturity of such Permitted
Investment the proceeds thereof, if not reinvested in a Permitted Investment in
accordance with the instructions of the Trustee, shall be deposited solely in a
Trust Account in accordance with Section 3.4(c).

            Section 4.2 The Trustee may pay litigation and administrative
expenses, deposit money from the Trust Account in one or more FDIC insured
demand deposit accounts at any bank or trust company, excluding that of the
Trustee, which has a capital stock and surplus aggregating at least
$100,000,000; provided that total deposits in each account and with each
institution do not exceed the FDIC insurance limits for such account or
accounts.

            Section 4.3 All Permitted Investments shall be on terms consistent
with the distribution requirements of Article 7 of this Agreement and the other
obligations of the Trust.

            Section 4.4 Any of the foregoing investments purchased with any of
the Trust Property shall be deemed a part of the Trust Property. Any earned
interest, dividends, distributions or gains from Permitted Investments shall be
included in the Trust Property.


                                  ARTICLE 5

                            CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

            Section 5.1 The Trustee may resign as Trustee at any time by giving
prior written notice to Leucadia; provided, however, that such resignation shall
not be effective earlier than sixty (60) days after the date of such notice
unless an



                                     7
<PAGE>
earlier effective date is agreed to by Leucadia and a new Trustee shall have
been appointed.

            Section 5.2 Upon resignation, death, or removal of a Trustee, a
successor trustee (a "Successor Trustee") shall be appointed by Leucadia on
behalf of the Beneficiaries, and the appointment of the Successor Trustee shall
be binding upon all Beneficiaries then holding beneficial interests in the
Trust.

            Section 5.3 Any Successor Trustee shall execute and deliver to the
Beneficiaries and to the predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment, the terms and conditions of which shall be the same as those
contained in this Agreement, and thereupon such Successor Trustee, without
further act, shall be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers,
duties and trusts of the predecessor Trustee in the Trust with like effect as if
originally named as Trustee herein; but nevertheless, upon the written request
of such Successor Trustee, the predecessor Trustee shall (i) execute,
acknowledge and deliver such instruments of conveyance and further assurances
and do such other things as may reasonably be required for more fully and
certainly vesting and confirming unto said Successor Trustee all the right,
title and interest of the predecessor Trustee in and to the Trust Property; (ii)
duly assign, transfer, deliver, account for and pay over to such Successor
Trustee any property or money then held by such predecessor Trustee upon the
trusts herein expressed; and (iii) deliver to such Successor Trustee any and all
records, or copies thereof, in respect of the Trust which it may have.


                                  ARTICLE 6

                            TRUSTEE'S COMPENSATION

            Section 6.1 The Trustee hereby waives any commission or fees for the
performance of its obligations as Trustee under this Agreement.


                                  ARTICLE 7

                        DISTRIBUTIONS TO BENEFICIARIES

            Section 7.1 All Trust Property shall be distributed by the Trustee
to the Beneficiaries, as beneficiaries under the Trust solely in accordance with
Section 7.2, on one or more distribution dates as determined by the Trustee.



                                     8
<PAGE>
            Section 7.2 The Trustee shall not be obligated to make any
distributions of Trust Property prior to July 5, 1999. As promptly as
practicable following the acquisition by the Trust of the Additional HomeFed
Stock under the Purchase Agreement, the Trust shall distribute the HomeFed Stock
Interest (and any other shares of HomeFed Stock that may then be Trust Property)
and any cash then held as Trust Property to the Beneficiaries; provided,
however, that the distribution of such shares of HomeFed Stock from the Trust to
the Beneficiaries shall be pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act, unless the Trustee shall have received an opinion of counsel
to the effect that no such registration statement is required for such
distribution. In the event that the shares of Additional HomeFed Stock are not
purchased by July 31, 1999 and the Purchase Agreement is then terminated, the
Trustee as promptly as practicable shall distribute to the Beneficiaries the
Trust Property then owned by the Trust; provided, however, that the distribution
of shares of the Owned HomeFed Stock from the Trust to the Beneficiaries shall
be pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,
unless the Trustee shall have received an opinion of counsel to the effect that
no such registration statement is required for such distribution. No
certificates representing fractional shares of HomeFed Stock will be distributed
by the Trustee to the Beneficiaries. In lieu of any fractional shares of HomeFed
Stock, (the "Fractional Shares"), the Trustee shall, on behalf of all holders of
such Fractional Shares, (i) determine the number of shares of HomeFed Stock that
would otherwise have been distributed as Fractional Shares, (ii) sell such
shares at the then prevailing market price, and (iii) determine the portion, if
any, of the net proceeds of such sale to which each holder of a Fractional Share
interest is entitled, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds of
the sale of the Factional Shares, by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of the Fractional Share to which such holder of a Fractional Share is
entitled, and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Fractional
Shares to which all holders of Fractional Shares are entitled. As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to
holders of Fractional Shares in lieu of such Fractional Shares, the Trustee
shall distribute such amounts, without interest, to such holders. Any cash
received on distribution in respect of, or proceeds from the sale of, the
HomeFed Stock Interest (or any other shares of HomeFed Stock that may then be
Trust Property) shall be distributed by the Trustee as promptly as practicable.

                           OF RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTION

except by will or under the laws of descent and distribution; (ii) shall not be
evidenced by a certificate or other instrument; (iii) shall not possess any
voting rights; (iv) shall not be entitled to receive any distributions, except
pursuant to Article 7; and (v) shall not represent any equity interest in
HomeFed Corporation.


                                  ARTICLE 9

                           TERMINATION OF THE TRUST

            Section 9.1 Other than the obligations of the Trustee under Section
3.5 hereof, this Agreement and the Trust created hereby shall terminate and this
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect on the earlier to occur of (i)
the date on which all of the Trust Property has been distributed to the
Beneficiaries in accordance with Article 7 or (ii) December 31, 2001.

            Section 9.2 No transfer, by operation of law or death, of the right,
title and interest of any Beneficiary in and to the Trust Property or hereunder
shall operate to terminate this Agreement or the Trust hereunder or entitle any
successor or transferee of such Beneficiary to an accounting (except to the
extent generally required under Section 3.7) or to the transfer to it of legal
title to any part of the Trust Property.


                                  ARTICLE 10

                                 JURISDICTION

            Section 10.1 Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

            Section 11.1 As used in this Agreement (including the recitals
herein), capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to them (such

terms defined or to the feminine, masculine or neuter gender, as the case may
be), unless the context otherwise requires.

            Section 11.2 This Agreement is not intended to create and shall not
be interpreted as creating an association, corporation, partnership or joint
venture of any kind; it is intended to create an investment trust within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-4(c)(i), to be governed and
construed in all respects as a trust without transferable interests; any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved, and any income tax reporting
obligations of the Trust and the Beneficiaries shall be fulfilled, in a manner
consistent with such treatment.

            Section 11.3 Leucadia shall not have or incur any obligation or
liability to any other person on account of any act or failure to act by the
Trustee or any other person.

            Section 11.4 The Trustee shall not assume any liability or incur any
obligation or liability to any other person in connection with the transfer by
Leucadia to the Trustee of the Trust Property, and no delegation of duty of
performance to the Trustee or assumption of liabilities of Leucadia by the
Trustee is intended hereby except as expressly set forth in Section 1.1 of this
Trust Agreement.

            Section 11.5 As promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
Leucadia shall certify to the Trustee the names of the Beneficiaries and the
amount of beneficial interests in the Trust held by each such Beneficiary.
Leucadia shall indemnify, defend and hold the Trustee harmless against claims of
any nature whatsoever with respect to Leucadia's determination of a
Beneficiary's share of beneficial interests in the Trust.

            Section 11.6 This Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time
by the Trustee and Leucadia, without the consent of any holders of beneficial
interests in the Trust, but only (i) to cure any ambiguity, correct or
supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other
provision herein, or to



                                     11
<PAGE>
make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under
this Trust Agreement not inconsistent with the other provisions of this Trust
Agreement, or (ii) to modify, eliminate or add to any provisions of this Trust
Agreement to such extent as shall be necessary to ensure that the Trust will be
classified for United States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust at
all times or to ensure that the Trust will not be required to register as an
"investment company" under the 1940 Act, or be classified as other than a
grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes; provided, however,
that in the case of clause (i), such action shall not adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any holder of a beneficial interest in the
Trust. In all other cases, this Trust Agreement may be amended with the approval
of holders of a majority of beneficial interests in the Trust, except with
respect to changes to the definition of Trust Property, which shall require a
favorable vote of all Beneficiaries. Any amendments to this Trust Agreement
shall become effective upon execution by the Trustee and Leucadia and notice
thereof shall be given to the Beneficiaries.

            Section 11.7 Except as provided herein, the obligations, duties
and/or rights of the Trustee under this Agreement shall not be assignable,
voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law, and any such assignment shall
be void. All covenants and agreements contained herein shall be binding upon and
are personal to the Trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the Trustee and
any Successor Trustee in the same manner.

            Section 11.8 This Agreement, together with the related instruments
expressly referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties,
and all such agreements shall be construed as integrated and complimentary of
each other.

            Section 11.9 Article headings in this Agreement are included for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement
for any other purpose.

            SECTION 11.10 This Agreement, shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws of the State of New York.

            SECTION 11.11 This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall
become effective immediately upon the exchange of executed signature pages,
which may be by facsimile.
