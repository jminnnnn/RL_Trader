     Item 1.   Business.
     ------    --------
                                   THE COMPANY

     GENERAL

          The Company is a diversified financial services holding company
     principally engaged in personal and commercial lines of property and
     casualty insurance, life and health insurance, banking and lending,
     manufacturing and the trading stamps business.  The Company
     concentrates on return on investment and cash flow to build long-term
     shareholder value, rather than emphasizing volume or market share. 
     Additionally, the Company continuously evaluates the retention and
     disposition of its existing operations and investigates possible
     acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value.

          Shareholders' equity has grown from a deficit of $7,657,000 at
     December 31, 1978 (prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest
     in the Company by the Company's Chairman and President), to a positive
     shareholders' equity of $881,815,000 at December 31, 1994, equal to a
     book value per common share of negative $.22 at December 31, 1978 and
     $31.44 at December 31, 1994.

          The Company's principal operations are its insurance businesses,
     where it is a specialty markets provider of property and casualty and
     life insurance products to niche markets.  The Company's principal
     personal lines insurance products are automobile insurance, homeowners
     insurance, graded benefit life insurance marketed primarily to the age
     50-and-over population and variable annuity products.  The Company's
     principal commercial lines are property and casualty products provided
     for multi-family residential real estate, retail establishments and
     taxicabs in the New York metropolitan area.  For the year ended
     December 31, 1994, the Company's insurance segments contributed 79% of
     total revenue and, at December 31, 1994, constituted 78% of
     consolidated assets.

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries have a diversified
     investment portfolio of securities, substantially all of which are
     issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by U.S. governmental
     agencies or are rated "investment grade" by Moody's Investors Service
     Inc. ("Moody's") and/or Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P"). 
     Investments in mortgage loans, real estate and non-investment grade
     securities represented less than 2% of the insurance subsidiaries'
     portfolio at December 31, 1994.  In the recent rising interest rate
     environment, the Company's primary goal has been to preserve
     investment capital.

          The Company's banking and lending operations principally consist
     of making instalment loans primarily funded by customer banking
     deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the
     "FDIC").  The Company has established a niche market for automobile
     loans to individuals with poor credit histories.  The Company's
     manufacturing operations primarily manufacture products for the "do-
     it-yourself" home improvement market and for industrial and
     agricultural markets.

          The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have substantial tax
     loss carryforwards.  The amount and availability of the tax loss
     carryforwards are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and
     uncertainties as more fully discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated
     Financial Statements.

          As used herein, the term "Company" refers to Leucadia National
     Corporation, a New York corporation organized in 1968, and its
     subsidiaries, except as the context otherwise may require.

     acquisition costs, commissions, and a portion of administrative,
     general and other expenses attributable to underwriting operations) to
     net premiums written, if determined in accordance with SAP, or to net
     premiums earned, if determined in accordance with GAAP.  A Combined
     Ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit and a Combined Ratio
     above 100% indicates an underwriting loss.  The Combined Ratio does
     not include the effect of investment income.

      (a)   Source:  Best's Aggregates & Averages, Property/Casualty, 1994 Edition. 
            Industry combined ratios may not be fully comparable as a result of,
            among other things, differences in geographical concentration and in the
            mix of property and casualty insurance products.

      (b)   For 1993, the difference in the treatment of certain costs for GAAP and
            SAP purposes was a principal reason for the difference between the GAAP
            Combined Ratio and the SAP Combined Ratio.  For 1992, the results of
            certain accident and health insurance business, which are reflected in
            the SAP Combined Ratio but are not reflected in the GAAP Combined Ratio,
            included a non-recurring income item which reduced the SAP Combined
            Ratio.  In addition, in 1992 certain income credits were recognized only
            for GAAP purposes.
</TABLE>


     Based on published reports, the Colonial Penn P&C Group's SAP Expense
     Ratio for 1993, the last year for which annual industry data is
     available, is among the lowest in the industry.

          The Colonial Penn P&C Group

          The Colonial Penn P&C Group's primary business is providing
     private passenger automobile and homeowners insurance coverage to the
     mature adult population.  As of December 31, 1994, the Group had
     approximately 352,000 voluntary auto policies in force.  Substantially
     all of the Group's policies are written for a one-year period. 
     However, in many states CPI and Franklin offer a "guaranteed lifetime
     protection" provision to certain qualifying policyholders that ensures
     their policies will be renewed at rates then in effect for their
     classification.

          The Colonial Penn P&C Group primarily markets its insurance
     products to the standard and preferred risk market segments through
     direct response marketing methods.  Direct response marketing includes
     any form of marketing in which a company and a customer deal directly
     with each other, rather than through an insurance agent.  The Colonial
     Penn P&C Group has become a low cost provider of its products to its
     niche markets,

     enabling it to charge competitive rates.  Since acquisition of the
     Colonial Penn P&C Group in 1991, the Company has substantially reduced
     the Group's marketing expenses, which the Company did not believe were
     justified by prior operating results, and also refined its marketing
     efforts.  This strategy has resulted in a decrease in policies in
     force; however, the rate of decline has slowed in each year since
     acquisition.  The Company believes that new business generated in 1995
     will exceed lapsed premiums, although there can be no assurance that
     this will be achieved.

          In recent years, the Colonial Penn P&C Group has acquired blocks
     of private passenger automobile assigned risk business from other
     insurance companies.  In addition to the premiums paid by
     policyholders, the Group also receives fee income from the insurance
     company from which the business was acquired.  The Group's low expense
     ratio enables it to offer competitive rates for this business.  The
     Colonial Penn P&C Group currently has contracts in force covering
     approximately $100,000,000 of annualized written premium.

          Prior to the Company's acquisition of Colonial Penn, CPI wrote as
     primary insurer or as a reinsurer a variety of diverse commercial
     property and casualty insurance business known as "Special Risks." 
     The nature of most of this insurance, which was not written after
     1988, involves exposures which can be expected to develop over a
     relatively long period of time before a definitive determination of
     ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses can be established and
     the relevant reinsurance collected.  Although losses with respect to
     this block of business are particularly difficult to predict
     accurately, the Company believes, based in part upon a


                                        5     <PAGE>

     recently completed independent actuarial review, that it has recorded
     adequate reserves as of December 31, 1994 ($63,700,000, before
     reinsurance).

          The Empire Group

          The Empire Group provides personal insurance coverage to
     automobile owners and homeowners and commercial insurance for
     residential real estate, restaurants, retail establishments, taxicabs
     (both medallion and radio-controlled) and several types of service
     contractors.

          For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, net earned
     premiums and commissions for the Empire Group were $299,200,000,
     $259,400,000 and $243,100,000, respectively.  Substantially all of the
     Empire Group policies are written in New York for a one-year period. 
     The Empire Group is licensed in New York to write all lines of
     insurance that may be written by a property and casualty insurer,
     except residual value, credit, unemployment, animal and marine
     protection and indemnity insurance and ocean marine insurance.

          As is true with the Company's other insurance subsidiaries, the
     Empire Group's marketing strategy emphasizes profitability rather than
     volume.  The voluntary business of the Empire Group is produced
     through general agents, local agents and insurance brokers, who are
     compensated for their services by payment of commissions on the
     premiums they generate.  There are five general agents, one of which
     is owned by Empire, and approximately 396 local agents and insurance
     brokers presently acting under agreements with the Empire Group. 
     These agents and brokers also represent other competing insurance
     companies.

          Like the Colonial Penn P&C Group, the Empire Group also has
     acquired blocks of private passenger automobile and commercial
     automobile assigned risk business from other insurance companies.  The
     Empire Group currently has contracts in force covering approximately
     $100,000,000 of annualized written premiums.  In addition, the Empire
     Group receives a fee as a "servicing carrier," providing
     administrative services, including claims processing, underwriting and
     collection activities, for the New York Public Automobile Pool.  This
     latter arrangement does not involve the assumption of any material
     underwriting risk by the Empire Group.

          Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

          Liabilities for unpaid losses, which are not discounted (except
     for certain workers' compensation liabilities), and loss adjustment
     expenses ("LAE") are determined using case-basis evaluations,
     statistical analyses and estimates for salvage and subrogation
     recoverable and represent estimates of the ultimate claim costs of all
     unpaid losses and LAE.  Liabilities include a provision for losses
     which have occurred but have not yet been reported.  These estimates
     are subject to the effect of trends in future claim severity and
     frequency experience.  Adjustments to such estimates are made from
     time to time due to changes in loss experience and are reflected in
     current earnings.

          The Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries rely
     upon standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques to obtain
     estimates of liabilities for losses and LAE.  These projections
     include the extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by business
     line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation
     and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon
     historical patterns.  In addition, methods based upon average loss
     costs, reported claim counts and pure premiums are reviewed in order
     to obtain a consistent range of estimates for setting the reserve
     levels.  For further input, loss reserve committees periodically
     review changes in operations in pertinent areas including underwriting
     standards, product mix, claims management and legal climate.

      (a)   The liability for losses and LAE at January 1, 1992 excludes

          The Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries'
     liability for losses and LAE as of December 31, 1994 was $933,033,000
     determined in accordance with SAP and $1,068,018,000 determined in
     accordance with GAAP.  The difference principally relates to
     liabilities assumed by reinsurers, which are not deducted from GAAP
     liabilities ($144,113,000), reduced by $4,035,000, net, included in
     accounts other than property and casualty loss reserves for GAAP and
     $5,093,000 for salvage and subrogation.

          The tables below present the development of balance sheet
     liabilities from 1984 through 1994 and include periods prior to
     acquisition for the Empire Group and the Colonial Penn P&C Group. 
     Because of substantial differences in the development of reserves of
     the Empire Group and the Colonial Penn P&C Group, loss and LAE
     development data is presented separately for each group.  The
     liability line at the top of each table indicates the estimated
     liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded as of the dates
     indicated.  The middle section of the table shows the re-estimated
     amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of
     the end of each succeeding year.  As more information becomes
     available and claims are settled, the estimated liabilities are
     adjusted upward or downward with the effect of decreasing or
     increasing net income at the time of adjustment.  The lower section of
     the table shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the
     previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year.  

          The "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" represents the aggregate
     change in the estimates over all prior years.  For example, the
     initial 1984 liability estimate indicated on the Empire Group table
     ($156,434,000) has been re-estimated during the course of the
     succeeding ten years, resulting in a re-estimated liability at
     December 31, 1994 of $140,989,000, or a redundancy of $15,445,000.  If
     the re-estimated liability exceeded the liability initially
     established, a cumulative deficiency would be indicated.  The
     cumulative deficiencies reflected in the Colonial Penn P&C Group table
     are for periods prior to the Company's acquisition of that Group.  The
     Company believes that the Colonial Penn P&C Group's conservatism and
     improved claims management procedures since acquisition in 1991 have
     contributed significantly to the creation of the redundancies included
     in its table below.

          In evaluating this information, it should be noted that each
     amount shown for "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" includes the
     effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods.  For example, the
     amount of the redundancy (deficiency) related to losses settled in
     1988, but incurred in 1984, will be included in the cumulative
     redundancy (deficiency) amount for 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.  This
     table is not intended to and does not present accident or policy year
     loss and LAE development data.  Conditions and trends that have
     affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily
     occur in the future.  Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to
     extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on these tables.

     LIFE INSURANCE

          The principal life insurance products offered during the three
     year period ended December 31, 1994 were "Graded Benefit Life" and
     variable annuity products.  The Company profitably increased sales of
     these products in 1994 and continues to explore the development of
     other new products for its niche markets.  Through its various
     subsidiaries, the Company is licensed in all 50 states, the District
     of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands and
     generally sells its products throughout most of the United States. 
     Total direct life insurance in force as of December 31, 1994 was $2.3
     billion.

          The following table reflects premium receipts on variable annuity
     and other investment oriented products and premiums earned on other
     life and health insurance products.  Variable annuity and other
     investment oriented product premium receipts are not recorded as
     revenue under GAAP but are recorded in a manner similar to a deposit,
     and are included below.

            subsidiaries.

          Life and Health Insurance Products

          Graded Benefit Life.  "Graded Benefit Life" is a guaranteed-issue
     product.  These modified-benefit, whole life policies are offered on
     an individual basis primarily to persons age 50 to 80, principally in
     face amounts of $350 to $10,000, without medical examination or
     evidence of insurability.  Premiums are paid as frequently as monthly. 
     Benefits paid are less than the face amount of the policy during the
     first two years, except in cases of accidental death.  Graded Benefit
     Life is marketed using direct response marketing techniques.  New
     policyholder leads are generated primarily from television
     advertisements.  The Company intends to continue to concentrate its
     marketing efforts towards soliciting new policyholders where the cost
     is justified, upgrading existing policyholders' policy packages and
     obtaining referrals from existing policyholders.

          Investment Oriented Products.  The principal investment oriented
     product offered is a no-load variable annuity ("VA") product.  The VA
     product is marketed as an investment vehicle to individuals seeking to
     defer,
                                        11<PAGE>

     for federal income tax purposes, the annual increase in their account
     balance.  Premiums from this VA product either are invested at the
     policyholders' election in unaffiliated mutual funds where the
     policyholder bears the entire investment risk or in a fixed account
     where the funds earn interest at rates determined by the Company.  The
     Company's VA product is currently marketed in conjunction with
     Scudder, Stevens and Clark, a mutual fund manager.  

          Medicare Supplement Products.  In 1992, the Company decided to
     discontinue actively marketing Medicare supplement products due to
     increased competition in this market.  The increased competition
     resulted from federal and state regulation that mandated
     standardization of such products.  The Company does continue to offer,
     on a profitable basis, renewals of its non-standardized products to
     existing policyholders.  The Company expects its renewals of these
     products will continue to decline in the future.

     INSURANCE OPERATIONS - GENERAL

          Investments

          Investment activities represent a significant part of the
     Company's insurance related revenues and profitability.  Investments
     are managed by the Company's investment advisors under the direction
     of, and upon consultation with, the Company's several investment
     committees.

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries have a diversified
     investment portfolio of securities, substantially all of which are
     rated "investment grade" by Moody's and/or S&P or issued or guaranteed
     by the U.S. Treasury or by governmental agencies.  The Company's
     insurance subsidiaries do not generally invest in less than
     "investment grade" or "non-rated" securities, real estate or
     mortgages, although from time to time they may make such investments
     in amounts not expected to be material.  In the recent rising interest
     rate environment, the Company's primary goal has been to preserve
     investment capital.

          The composition of the Company's insurance subsidiaries'
     investment portfolio as of December 31, 1994 and 1993 was as follows:

          Reinsurance

          Reinsurance is obtained for investment oriented products for face
     amounts in excess of $500,000 per life.  The life insurance
     subsidiaries generally do not obtain reinsurance for the Graded
     Benefit Life products because these policies generally have a low face
     amount.  The Colonial Penn P&C Group obtained reinsurance for casualty
     risks in excess of $2,000,000 in 1994 and 1993, although most Colonial
     Penn P&C Group automobile policies do not have policy limits in excess
     of $100,000 per risk and $300,000 per accident.  The Empire Group's
     maximum retained limit for workers' compensation was $500,000 from
     July 1, 1992 through December 31, 1994 and $200,000 from January 1,
     1992 through June 30, 1992; for other property and casualty lines, the
     Empire Group's maximum retained limit was $225,000 for 1994 and 1993
     and $175,000 for 1992.  

          Additionally, the Company's property and casualty insurance
     subsidiaries have entered into certain excess of loss and catastrophe
     treaties to protect against certain losses.  The Colonial Penn P&C
     Group's retention of lower level losses in such treaties was
     $11,000,000 in 1994 and 1993, and $4,000,000 in 1992.  Although the
     Group has completed its 1995 reinsurance program at acceptable upper
     loss limits, it was unable to obtain 1994 levels of deductibility at
     reasonable cost.  Accordingly, the Group's retention of lower level
     losses was increased to $15,000,000.  The Empire Group's retention of
     lower level losses in such treaties was $3,000,000 for 1994 and 1993,
     and $1,750,000 for 1992.  The Company has not experienced any material
     losses to date in 1995, including losses relating to recent storm damage
     in California.

          Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from
     its primary liability for the full amount of the policy liability, it
     does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent
     of the reinsurance ceded.   The Company's reinsurance generally has
     been placed with certain of the largest reinsurance companies,
     including (with their respective Best ratings) General Reinsurance
     Corporation (A++), Lincoln National Life Insurance Co. (A+) and Munich
     American Reinsurance Company (A++), each of which the Company believes
     to be financially capable of meeting its respective obligations. 
     However, to the extent that any reinsuring company is unable to meet
     its obligations, the Company's insurance subsidiaries would be liable
     for the reinsured risks.  The Company has established reserves, which
     the Company believes are adequate, for any nonrecoverable reinsurance.

          Competition

          The insurance industry is a highly competitive industry, in which
     many of the Company's competitors have substantially greater financial
     resources, larger sales forces, more widespread agency and broker
     relationships, and more diversified lines of insurance coverage. 
     Additionally, certain competitors market their products with
     endorsements from affinity groups, while the Company's products are
     for the most part unendorsed, which may give such other companies a
     competitive advantage.  Congress is considering changes to federal
     banking laws, certain of which could result in banks being able to
     offer insurance products in direct competition with the Company.  The
     Company is unable to determine what effect, if any, such changes may
     have on the Company's operations.

          VA products are subject to regulation both as insurance policies
     and as securities.  The Company expects sales of its no-load VA
     product to be cyclical, generally following the securities markets. 
     The attractiveness of VA products as an investment vehicle is closely
     linked to the tax status of such products.  Typically, increases in
     account values of VA products are not taxed until distributed in the
     form of either surrenders or annuity payments.  The taxable portion of
     distributions is taxed as ordinary income.








                                        13<PAGE>

          The property and casualty insurance industry has historically
     been cyclical in nature, with periods of less intense price competi-
     tion and high underwriting standards generating significant profits,
     followed by periods of increased price competition and lower under-
     writing standards resulting in reduced profitability or loss.  Price
     competition has been significant in recent years.  The cyclicality and
     competitive nature of the property and casualty insurance business
     historically have contributed to significant industry-wide quarter-to-
     quarter and year-to-year fluctuations in underwriting results and net
     income.  Its profitability is affected by many factors, including rate
     competition, severity and frequency of claims (including catastrophe
     losses), interest rates, state regulation, court decisions and
     judicial climate, all of which are outside the Company's control.

          Government Regulation

          Insurance companies are subject to detailed regulation and
     supervision in the states in which they transact business.  Such
     regulation pertains to matters such as approving policy forms and
     various premium rates, minimum reserves and loss ratio requirements,
     the type and amount of investments, minimum capital and surplus
     requirements, granting and revoking licenses to transact business,
     levels of operations and regulating trade practices.  The majority of
     the Company's property and casualty insurance operations are in states
     requiring prior approval by regulators before proposed rates may be
     implemented.  Certain states have indicated that they may change the
     bases (e.g., age, sex and geographic location) on which rates
     traditionally have been established.  Rates proposed for life
     insurance generally become effective immediately upon filing. 
     Insurance companies are required to file detailed annual reports with
     the supervisory agencies in each of the states in which they do
     business, and are subject to examination by such agencies at any time. 
     Increased regulation of insurance companies at the state level and new
     regulation at the federal level is possible, although the Company
     cannot predict the nature or extent of any such regulation or what
     impact it would have on the Company's operations.

          The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has
     adopted model laws incorporating the concept of a "risk based capital"
     ("RBC") requirement for insurance companies.  Generally, the RBC
     formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory
     capital in relation to the risks inherent in its business.  The RBC
     formula is used by the states as an early warning tool to identify
     weakly capitalized companies for the purpose of initiating regulatory
     action.  Each of the Company's insurance subsidiaries' RBC ratio as of
     December 31, 1994 substantially exceeded minimum requirements.

          The NAIC also has adopted various ratios for insurance companies
     which, in addition to the RBC ratio, are designed to serve as a tool
     to assist state regulators in discovering potential weakly capitalized
     companies or companies with unusual trends.  Generally, insurance
     companies having three or more of such ratios outside their "normal"
     range may be designated as requiring regulatory attention.  Charter
     had four "other than normal" NAIC ratios for the year ended December
     31, 1994, three of which related to either the 1993 reinsurance of a
     block of life insurance business described under "Management's
     Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
     Operations" or Charter's investment in its insurance subsidiaries. 
     The Company believes that there are no underlying problems or
     weaknesses at Charter and that it is unlikely that material adverse
     regulatory action will be taken.

          On November 8, 1988, California voters passed Proposition 103, an
     insurance initiative that requires, among other things, a 20% rollback
     in insurance rates for policies written or renewed during the twelve
     month period beginning November 8, 1988.  In November 1994, the
     Colonial Penn P&C Group received an order requiring it to refund
     $35,300,000, plus $21,700,000 of interest as its rollback obligation. 
     The Colonial Penn P&C Group disagrees with the calculation of the
     assessment.  The Company is in discussions with the California
     Department of Insurance and has filed a request for a formal hearing
     should informal discussions fail



                                        14<PAGE>

     to come to a satisfactory conclusion.  The Company believes that the
     ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse
     effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations
     and will not exceed reserves established in prior years.

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries are members of state
     insurance funds which provide certain protection to policyholders of
     insolvent insurers doing business in those states.  Due to
     insolvencies of certain insurers in recent years, the Company's
     insurance subsidiaries have been assessed certain amounts which have
     not been material and are likely to be assessed additional amounts by
     state insurance funds.  The Company believes that it has provided for
     all anticipated assessments and that any additional assessments will
     not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
     condition or results of operations.


                               BANKING AND LENDING

          The Company's banking and lending operations primarily are
     conducted through American Investment Bank, N.A. ("AIB"), its national
     bank subsidiary, American Investment Financial ("AIF"), an industrial
     loan corporation, and Transportation Capital Corp. ("TCC"), a small
     business investment company.  AIB and AIF take money market and other
     non-demand deposits that are eligible for insurance provided by the
     FDIC.  At December 31, 1994, AIB and AIF had deposits of $179,888,000
     compared to $173,365,000 at December 31, 1993.  AIB and AIF currently
     have several deposit-taking and lending facilities in the Salt Lake
     City area.  TCC makes collateralized loans to operators of medallion
     taxicabs and limousines.

          At December 31, 1994, the Company's consolidated banking and
     lending operations had outstanding loans (net of unearned finance
     charges) of $264,196,000 compared to $205,744,000 at December 31,
     1993.  At December 31, 1994, 49% were loans to individuals generally
     collateralized by automobiles; 22% were unsecured loans to individuals
     acquired from others in connection with investments in limited
     partnerships; 23% were unsecured loans to executives and
     professionals; 4% were loans to small business concerns collateralized
     principally by taxicab medallions and other personal property; and 2%
     were instalment loans to consumers, substantially all of which were
     collateralized by real or personal property.

          It is the Company's policy to charge to income an allowance for
     losses which, based upon management's analysis of numerous factors,
     including current economic trends, aging of the loan portfolio and
     historical loss experience, is deemed adequate to cover reasonably
     expected losses on outstanding loans.  At December 31, 1994, the
     allowance for loan losses for the Company's entire loan portfolio was
     $12,308,000 or 4.7% of the net outstanding loans, compared to
     $8,341,000 or 4.1% of net outstanding loans at December 31, 1993.

          The funds generated by the deposits are primarily used to make
     instalment loans, including collateralized personal automobile loans
     to individuals who have difficulty in obtaining credit.  These
     automobile loans are made at interest rates above those charged to
     individuals with good credit histories.  In determining which
     individuals qualify for these loans, the Company takes into account a
     number of highly selective criteria with respect to the individual as
     well as the collateral to attempt to minimize the number of defaults. 
     Additionally, the Company closely monitors these loans and takes
     prompt possession of the collateral in the event of a default.  For
     the three year period ended December 31, 1994, the Company generated
     $182,448,000 of these loans ($101,000,000 during 1994).  At December
     31, 1994, the allowance for loan losses for this portfolio was
     $7,771,000 or 6% of net outstanding loans; actual loss experience has
     been 1.7% per year of average outstanding loans.  The Company is
     satisfied with the results of this loan portfolio and believes that
     there is an opportunity for continued growth in this niche market.

          The Company's lending operations compete with banks, savings and
     loan associations, credit unions, credit card issuers and consumer
     finance companies, many of which are able to offer financial services
     on very competitive terms.  Additionally, substantial national
     financial services networks have been formed by major brokerage firms,
     insurance companies, retailers and bank holding companies.  Some
     competitors have substantial local market positions; others are part
     of large, diversified organizations.  

          The Company's principal lending operations are subject to
     detailed supervision by state authorities, as well as federal
     regulation pursuant to the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and
     regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission.  The
     Company's banking operations are subject to federal and state
     regulation and supervision by, among others, the Office of the
     Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), the FDIC and the State of
     Utah.  AIB's primary federal regulator is the OCC, while the primary
     federal regulator for AIF is the FDIC.

          The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 ("CEBA") places
     certain restrictions on the operations and growth of AIB and restricts
     further acquisitions of banks and savings institutions by the Company. 
     CEBA does not restrict the growth of AIF as currently operated.  

                                 TRADING STAMPS

          The Company's trading stamp business is conducted by The Sperry
     and Hutchinson Company, Inc. ("S&H").  S&H distributes Green Stamps to
     retailers under license agreements that give the retailer an exclusive
     franchise for a particular category of retail establishment in a
     particular geographic area.  Customers of participating retailers
     receive Green Stamps when they purchase goods and services.

          Since 1969, when annual sales for the trading stamp industry as a
     whole peaked, sales for both the industry and S&H have been declining. 
     The Company expects that this declining trend in trading stamp sales
     will continue.  The Company has attempted, but has not succeeded in,
     developing new uses for its trading stamp business.

          When trading stamps are sold, S&H receives cash and accrues as a
     liability the estimated obligation to deliver merchandise and/or cash
     associated with those stamps.  Demands for redemption generally occur
     over a considerable period of time.  The loss of customers usually
     results in an acceleration of redemptions and requires the expenditure
     of available funds to provide the merchandise and/or cash required for
     such redemptions.

          The Company's trading stamp business competes with other
     incentive companies and other forms of promotional and merchandising
     techniques.  Retail establishments, for example, frequently utilize
     store coupons, special advertising programs, games, extra services and
     related programs.

                                  MANUFACTURING

          The Company's manufacturing operations consist primarily of the
     manufacture of bathroom vanities and related products for the "do-it-
     yourself" market, and padding, absorbent, erosion control and
     proprietary plastic netting products for various industrial and
     agricultural markets.

          Bathroom vanities and related products are sold through
     manufacturers' representatives, primarily to home improvement centers. 
     Principally due to operating inefficiencies and pricing pressures,
     this division has not operated profitability in recent years.  In
     1994, the Company commenced a restructuring program to









                                        16<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     reevaluate and reduce its existing product lines, to review the
     manufacturing process and to reduce overhead.  The Company is unable
     to predict if this division's restructuring efforts will result in a
     return to profitability.

          The fibers and plastics divisions manufacture and market padding,
     absorbent and erosion control products, which may be reinforced with
     plastic netting, for the furniture, automotive, erosion control and
     maintenance industries and thermoplastic netting used for a variety of
     purposes including, among other things, construction, packaging,
     agriculture, carpet backing and filtration.

          The manufacturing operations are subject to a high degree of
     competition, generally on the basis of price, service and quality. 
     Additionally, these manufacturing operations are dependent on cyclical
     industries, including the construction and automobile industries. 
     Through its various manufacturing divisions, the Company holds patents
     on certain improvements to the basic manufacturing processes and on
     applications thereof.  The Company believes that the expiration of
     these patents, individually or in the aggregate, is unlikely to have a
     material effect on manufacturing operations.


                        OTHER OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS

          The Company also owns non-controlling equity interests
     representing more than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of each of
     the following domestic public companies at December 31, 1994:  Carmike
     Cinemas, Inc. ("Carmike") (approximately 8% of Class A shares), Jones
     Plumbing Systems, Inc. ("Jones") (approximately 21%), Jordan
     Industries, Inc. ("JII") (approximately 11%) and Olympus Capital
     Corporation (approximately 17%).

          In April 1994, the Company acquired a 30% interest in Caja de
     Ahorro y Seguro S.A. ("Caja") from the government of Argentina for a
     preliminary purchase price of approximately $46,000,000, including
     costs. Caja is a holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in
     property and casualty insurance, life insurance and banking in
     Argentina.  The preliminary purchase price is subject to adjustment
     based upon the reduction in Caja's net assets from December 31, 1993
     to the acquisition date.  Amounts included in the Company's results of
     operations for Caja since acquisition have not been material. 

          A subsidiary of the Company is a partner in The Jordan Company
     and Jordan/Zalaznick Capital Company.  These partnerships each
     specialize in structuring leveraged buyouts in which the partners are
     given the opportunity to become equity participants.  John W. Jordan
     II, a director of the Company, is the managing partner of the two
     partnerships.  Since 1982, the Company has invested an aggregate of
     $29,147,000 in these partnerships and related companies and, through
     December 31, 1994, has received approximately $69,728,000 (consisting
     of cash, interest bearing notes and other receivables) relating to the
     disposition of investments and management and other fees.  At December
     31, 1994, through these partnerships, the Company had interests in an
     aggregate of 16 companies (the "Jordan Associated Companies"), which
     are carried in the Company's consolidated financial statements at
     $12,270,000.  The Jordan Associated Companies include JII, Carmike and
     Jones.

          Certain subsidiaries of the Company remain under the control of
     the Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner as a result of rehabilitation or
     liquidation proceedings initiated prior to their acquisition by the
     Company.  The Company believes only two of these subsidiaries have any
     residual value to the Company.  The Company estimates that the fair
     value of the net tangible assets of these subsidiaries is
     approximately $34,000,000 in excess of their recorded carrying value
     at December 31, 1994.  Although the Company expects to receive these
     assets, the Company is unable to predict when these subsidiaries will
     be returned to its control.

          In 1994, the Company expanded its real estate investments by
     acquiring a 615,000 square foot office building located near Grand
     Central Terminal in New York City, and two luxury residential
     condominium towers in downtown San Diego, California.  The New York
     City office building, which was purchased for $50,800,000, has 355,000
     square feet of contiguous space available for occupancy.  After
     certain improvements to the building are completed, the Company
     intends to lease the available space.  The San Diego towers were
     acquired for $42,000,000 through the Company's acquisition of HSD
     Venture.  HSD Venture, a California general partnership that had been
     in reorganization proceedings under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,
     is the developer and owner of the towers, which include 202
     residential units, 180 of which are for sale, and 42,000 square feet
     of retail space.

     Condition and Results of Operations" included in this report.


     Item 2.   Properties.
     ------    ----------

          Through its various subsidiaries, the Company owns and utilizes
     in its operations the following significant properties: two office
     buildings located in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania used by the Colonial
     Penn P&C Group (totaling approximately 198,700 sq. ft.), one of which
     is located on land leased from a third party; two offices in Salt Lake
     City, Utah used for corporate and banking and lending activities
     (totaling approximately 77,000 sq. ft.); and an office building in
     Philadelphia, Pennsylvania used by the life insurance companies
     (approximately 127,000 sq. ft.).  In addition, subsidiaries of the
     Company own nine facilities (totaling approximately 1,208,000 sq. ft.)
     primarily used for manufacturing and storage located in Georgia, New
     Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Canada.

          The Company and its subsidiaries lease numerous manufacturing,
     warehousing, office and headquarters facilities.  The facilities vary
     in size and have leases expiring at various times, subject, in certain
     instances, to renewal options.  See Notes to Consolidated Financial
     Statements.

     Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.  
     ------    -----------------

     PHLCORP MERGER

          As previously disclosed, in connection with the 1992 merger of
     Phlcorp, Inc. ("Phlcorp"), (then a 63.1% owned public subsidiary of
     the Company), with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
     (the "Phlcorp Merger"), two actions were filed by minority
     shareholders of Phlcorp in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
     County of New York.  The parties entered into a memorandum of
     understanding to settle the matter on terms not material to the
     Company, subject to plaintiffs' conducting confirmatory discovery and
     the court's approval of the settlement.  Discovery has been completed
     and the parties have entered into a stipulation of settlement, subject
     to court approval, which dismisses these actions with prejudice.

          Defendants believe that the material allegations of these
     complaints are without merit and, if not settled, intend to defend
     these actions vigorously.

     PINNACLE LITIGATION

          On May 11, 1994, a shareholder of the Company filed a purported
     derivative action on behalf of the Company against the Company's
     current Board of Directors and one former director, Melvin Hirsch. 
     The action was filed in the United States District Court for the
     Southern District of New York and is entitled Pinnacle Consultants,
                                                   ---------------------
     Ltd. v. Leucadia National Corporation, et al. (C.A. No. 94 Civ. 3496).
     ----    -------------------------------------
     Plaintiff alleges that the New York Business Corporation Law (the
     "BCL") prohibited the Company from issuing warrants to Ian Cumming and
     Joseph Steinberg, Chairman and President, respectively, of the
     Company, for the purchase of common shares of the Company.  Plaintiff
     also alleges that the Company's 1990 Proxy Statement, which sought
     approval of a merger of Marks Investing Company into the Company, was
     false and misleading because it did not disclose that, under the BCL,
     common shares of the Company owned by the partnership that was the
     principal shareholder of the Company could not be voted on the merger. 
     The complaint alleges claims for violations of the Racketeer Influence
     and Corrupt Organizations Act, Section 14(a) of the Securities
     Exchange Act of 1934 and state law claims for waste, breach of
     fiduciary duty and fraud and seeks monetary damages in an unspecified
     amount.  Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint.  Briefing on
     the motion to dismiss is complete and the motion is currently
     scheduled to be argued on June 23, 1995.  The Court has stayed all
     discovery in the action pending resolution of defendants' motion to
     dismiss.

     OTHER PROCEEDINGS

          In addition to the foregoing, the Company and its subsidiaries
     are parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either
     ordinary, routine litigation incidental to their business or not
     material to the Company's consolidated financial position.

          The Company does not believe that any of the foregoing actions
     will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
     position or consolidated results of operations.


     Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

          The common shares of the Company (the "Common Shares") are traded
     on the New York Stock Exchange and Pacific Stock Exchange under the

     indicated, the high and low sales price per Common Share on the
     consolidated transaction reporting system, as reported by the Dow
     Jones Historical Stock Quote Reporter Service.  On January 8, 1993,
     the Company effected a two-for-one stock split of the Common Shares in
     the form of a 100% stock dividend (the "Stock Split").  The dividend
     was paid to shareholders of record immediately following the close of
     business on December 31, 1992.  Per share amounts set forth in this
     Report have been adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.

        The Combined Ratio does not reflect the effect of investment income.  For 1993, the difference in the treatment of
        costs for GAAP and SAP purposes was a principal reason for the difference between the GAAP Combined Ratio and the SAP
        Combined Ratio.  For 1992, the results of certain accident and health insurance business had a non-recurring income
        item which reduced the SAP Combined Ratio.  In addition, in 1992 certain income credits were recognized only for GAAP
        purposes.

     Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
              -----------------------------------------------------------
              and Results of Operations.
              -------------------------

          The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the
     Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital
     resources and results of operations.  This analysis should be read in
     conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related
     notes which appear elsewhere in this report.

     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          Parent Company Liquidity.  Leucadia National Corporation (the
          ------------------------
     "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the
     stock of its several direct subsidiaries.  Additionally, the Parent
     continuously evaluates its existing operations and investigates
     possible acquisitions of new businesses and dispositions of businesses
     in order to maximize its ultimate economic value to shareholders. 
     Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement,
     commitment or understanding with respect thereto, further
     acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital
     structure are possible.  Its principal sources of funds are its
     available cash resources, bank borrowings, public financings,
     repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from its
     subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees, and
     borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated
     subsidiaries.  It has no substantial recurring cash requirements other
     than payment of interest and principal on its debt, tax payments and
     corporate overhead expenses.

          The Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and
     its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to
     certain of its subsidiaries.  These borrowings have primarily been
     made on an unsecured basis from banks through various credit agreement
     facilities and term loans, and through public financings.  During the
     year ended December 31, 1994, the Company did not utilize its
     $150,000,000 bank credit agreement facilities, except for certain
     minor amounts borrowed to meet daily cash requirements.  These
     agreements were renewed during 1994 to expire in June 1997.  In June
     1994, the Parent entered into a $50,000,000 five-year term loan
     agreement with certain of its bank lenders. The term loan and the bank
     credit agreement facilities bear interest based on the prime rate or
     LIBOR.  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its
     variable rate borrowings.  The Company has entered into interest rate
     swap and interest rate option agreements to reduce the impact of
     changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt.  Counterparties
     to these agreements are major financial institutions, which the
     Company believes are able to fulfill their obligations; however, if
     they are not, the Company believes that any losses would not be
     material.

          There are no restrictions on distributions from the non-regulated
     subsidiaries and therefore all cash available to these subsidiaries is
     available to the Parent for general corporate purposes, including
     acquisitions.  The Parent and its non-regulated subsidiaries had
     aggregate cash and temporary investments of approximately $63,500,000
     at December 31, 1994.  Based on discussions with commercial and
     investment bankers, the Company believes that it has the ability to
     raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its
     existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities. 
     Since 1993, the Company's senior debt obligations have been rated as
     "investment grade" by Moody's, S&P and Duff & Phelps Inc.  Ratings
     issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time.

          At December 31, 1994, a maximum of approximately $38,200,000 was
     available to the Parent as dividends from the regulated subsidiaries
     without regulatory approval.  Additional amounts may be available to
     the Parent in the form of loans or cash advances from regulated
     subsidiaries, although no amounts were outstanding at December 31,
     1994 or borrowed to date in 1995.  The Parent also receives tax
     sharing payments from subsidiaries included in its consolidated income
     tax return, including certain regulated subsidiaries.  Because of the
     tax loss carryforwards available to the Parent and certain
     subsidiaries, together with current interest deductions and corporate
     expenses, the amount paid by the Parent for income taxes is
     substantially less
                                        25<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     than tax sharing payments received from its subsidiaries.  In
     addition, the Parent receives payments from the regulated and
     non-regulated entities for services provided by the Parent.  Payments
     from regulated subsidiaries for dividends, tax sharing payments, other
     services and purchases of assets totaled $105,400,000 and $101,000,000
     during the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

          Consolidated Liquidity.  During each of the three years in the
          ----------------------
     period ended December 31, 1994, the Company operated profitably and in
     the year ended December 31, 1994, net cash was provided from
     operations.  For the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, in spite
     of increased earnings, net cash was used for operations, principally
     as a result of payments made in connection with reinsurance
     transactions.

          In April 1994, the Company acquired a 30% interest in Caja from
     the government of Argentina for a preliminary purchase price of
     approximately $46,000,000, including costs.  The preliminary purchase
     price is subject to adjustment based upon the reduction in Caja's net
     assets from December 31, 1993 to the acquisition date.  The Company
     believes that the level of Caja's operating costs could not be
     justified by its existing revenue base.  Accordingly, the new
     management of Caja has implemented an extensive restructuring plan
     including a substantial reduction in the number of employees and a
     consolidation of Caja's offices.  The Company believes Caja's
     restructuring efforts have increased its operating efficiency since
     acquisition, although there can be no assurance that this will
     continue.  Amounts included in the Company's results of operations for
     Caja since acquisition have not been material.

          Recent economic instability in Mexico has affected several Latin
     American countries and has caused a withdrawal of foreign funds
     invested in publicly traded Argentine government and corporate
     securities, a contraction in the money supply and significantly higher
     interest rates in Argentina.  Although Argentina's economic policies
     appear sound, and the recently announced multi-billion dollar
     international loan package for Argentina should aid its economic
     program, if the liquidity crisis does not improve, the Company's
     investment in Caja could suffer.  In addition, the Company's
     investment is subject to the foreign currency exchange risk of a
     devaluation of the Argentine peso against the United States dollar,
     although the Argentine government has indicated that a devaluation is
     not being considered.

          During 1994, the Company invested approximately $25,000,000 in
     the Russian privatization program.  Through this program, the Company
     acquired equity interests in various companies through auctions
     conducted by the Russian government.  Investing in the emerging
     markets of Russia is subject to foreign exchange risk, political risk
     and uncertainty concerning the government's ability to succeed in its
     program to convert to a market economy, all of which are beyond the
     Company's control.  Given these uncertainties, the Company is
     accounting for these investments under the cost recovery method. 
     These investments have a balance of approximately $19,600,000 at
     December 31, 1994.

          In May 1994, the Company acquired a 615,000 square foot office
     building located near Grand Central Terminal in New York City for
     approximately $50,800,000.  The building has approximately 355,000
     square feet of contiguous space available for occupancy.  After
     certain improvements to the building are completed, the Company
     intends to lease the available space to third parties.  Should lease
     rates not be deemed adequate, the Company may use some of the
     available space for its operations. 

          In July 1994, the Company acquired HSD Venture, a California
     general partnership which was in reorganization proceedings under
     chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, for approximately $42,000,000.  HSD
     Venture is the developer and owner of two luxury condominium towers in
     downtown San Diego, California.  The property includes approximately
     202 residential units, of which approximately 180 are available for
     sale, and approximately 42,000 square feet of retail space.  
     Marketing of the remaining units has commenced.

                                        26<PAGE>

          The funds for the investments described above were provided from
     general corporate funds available to the Parent company.

          The investment portfolios of the Company's insurance subsidiaries
     are principally fixed maturity investments rated "investment grade" or
     U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although
     limited investments in "non rated" or rated less than "investment
     grade" securities have been made from time to time.  The investment
     strategy of the insurance subsidiaries has been to maintain a high
     quality portfolio of publicly traded, fixed income securities with a
     relatively short duration.  Principally as a result of increases in
     market interest rates during 1994, the unrealized gain on investments
     at the end of 1993 of approximately $49,912,000 (net of taxes) became
     an unrealized loss of approximately $41,309,000 (net of taxes) as of
     December 31, 1994.  While this has resulted in a reduction in
     shareholders' equity, it had no effect on results of operations or
     cash flows.  The estimated average yield to maturity of bonds and
     notes in the Company's investment portfolio was higher at December 31,
     1994 than at the end of the preceding year.

          During the three years ended December 31, 1994, the property and
     casualty insurance industry suffered unprecedented losses from natural
     disasters, including the Northridge, California earthquake and winter
     storms in 1994, winter storm and fire related losses in 1993 and
     Hurricane Andrew in 1992.  The Company's insurance subsidiaries also
     suffered certain of such losses, although as described below in
     "Results of Operations," their catastrophe reinsurance programs
     substantially reduced the economic losses in 1994 and 1992.  As a
     result of the industry's losses, the Company has seen a notable
     decrease in the availability of reinsurance at reasonable rates,
     particularly at low levels of deductibility.  Although the reinsurance
     programs have been completed at acceptable upper loss limits (albeit
     at a somewhat increased cost), the insurance subsidiaries have been
     unable to maintain previous levels of deductibility at reasonable
     cost.  Accordingly, in 1995, the Company raised its retention of lower
     level losses from $11,000,000 to $15,000,000.  In spite of the natural
     disasters, the Company did not incur losses in excess of its maximum
     reinsurance during the last three years.  Further, the Company has not
     experienced any material losses to date in 1995, including losses
     relating to recent storm damage in California.

          On November 8, 1988, California voters passed Proposition 103, an
     insurance initiative that requires, among other things, a 20% rollback
     in insurance rates for policies written or renewed during the twelve
     month period beginning November 8, 1988.  In November 1994, the
     Colonial Penn P&C Group received an order requiring it to refund
     $35,300,000, plus $21,700,000 of interest as its rollback obligation. 
     The Colonial Penn P&C Group disagrees with the calculation of the
     assessment.  The Company is in discussions with the California
     Department of Insurance and has filed a request for a formal hearing
     should informal discussions fail to come to a satisfactory conclusion. 
     The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of this matter will
     not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
     condition or results of operations and will not exceed reserves
     established in prior years.

          In recent years there has been significant uncertainty with
     respect to potential additional assessments from the New Jersey
     insurance pool for high-risk drivers.  During 1994, there were
     significant legislative and other developments which resolved the
     uncertainty. In February 1994, the Colonial Penn P&C Group paid
     approximately $5,300,000, which had been reserved for in prior years,
     representing its share of the losses of this insurance pool.

          The NAIC has adopted a model law incorporating the concept of a
     risk based capital ("RBC") requirement for insurance companies. 
     Generally, RBC is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's
     statutory capital in relation to the risks inherent in the business. 
     The RBC formula is used by the states as an early warning tool to
     identify weakly capitalized companies for the purpose of initiating
     regulatory action.  Each

     of the Company's insurance subsidiaries' RBC ratio as of December 31,
     1994 substantially exceeded the minimum requirements.

          Based on its experience since 1988 in providing collateralized
     automobile loans to individuals with poor credit histories, during
     1993 the Company concluded that there were excellent opportunities for
     successful expansion of this business.  Accordingly, on a controlled
     basis, the Company, increased its investment in these loans.  The
     Company's investment in these loans was $129,512,000, $73,321,000 and
     $47,890,000 at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The
     Company expects to further increase its investment in these loans in
     1995.

          The government of El Salvador and representatives of the Company
     had previously reached agreement as to the amount to be paid for the
     assets of an electric utility in El Salvador in which the Company had
     an interest.  Pursuant to such agreement, on March 30, 1993, the
     Company received cash of approximately $5,300,000 and approximately
     $12,000,000 principal amount of 6% U.S. dollar denominated El Salvador
     Government bonds due in instalments through 1996.  As a result of
     receiving required prepayments and the subsequent sale of the bonds in
     the first quarter of 1994, the Company reported a pre-tax gain of
     $8,458,000.

          In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company sold its remaining
     interest in Bolivian Power Company Limited ("Bolivian Power") to an
     unaffiliated party for cash of approximately $18,000,000.  The Company
     recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $14,500,000.

          The Company's liability for unredeemed trading stamps is
     estimated based on the cost of merchandise, cash and related
     redemption service expenses required to redeem the trading stamps
     which are expected to be presented for redemption in the future.  The
     Company periodically reviews the appropriateness of the estimated
     redemption rates based upon recent experience, statistical evaluations
     and other relevant factors.  The most recent statistical studies of
     trading stamp redemptions have indicated that the recorded liability
     for unredeemed trading stamps is in excess of the amount that
     ultimately will be required to redeem trading stamps outstanding.  The
     amount of this excess may be different than indicated by these
     studies.  Accordingly, the Company has been amortizing the aggregate
     apparent excess over a five year period.  Based upon the most recent
     studies, the unamortized apparent excess was approximately $5,358,000
     at December 31, 1994 and $17,067,000 at December 31, 1993.  The
     Company will continue to monitor current redemptions and estimates of
     ultimate redemptions.

          The Company is to receive, without additional consideration, the
     residual interest in two subsidiaries that remain under the control of
     the Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner; however the timing of receipt of
     these assets is uncertain.  The Company estimates that the fair value
     of the net tangible assets of these subsidiaries was approximately
     $34,000,000 in excess of their carrying amount at December 31, 1994. 
     The underlying assets of these subsidiaries are principally invested
     in high quality, interest bearing securities.

          The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Phlcorp
     and its subsidiaries, have substantial loss carryforwards and other
     tax attributes (as more fully discussed in the Notes to Consolidated
     Financial Statements).  The amount and availability of tax loss
     carryforwards are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and
     uncertainties, including, with respect to Phlcorp and its
     subsidiaries, tax sharing payments pursuant to a tax settlement
     agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of
     Justice.  In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in
     ownership could impose limitations on the use of these carryforwards,
     which could reduce their value to the Company, the Company's
     certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally
     restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating at least
     five percent of the Common Shares and the ability of persons or
     entities now owning at least five percent of the




                                        28<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     

     Common Shares from acquiring additional Common Shares.  The Company
     has recognized as an asset (net of reserves) certain of the benefits
     of such loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.  However, the
     amount of the asset recognized only reflects the minimum Phlcorp tax
     loss carryforwards and is based, in part, on certain proposed
     regulations affecting the use of Phlcorp's tax loss carryforwards.  As
     described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
     significant additional amounts may be available under certain
     circumstances.

     Results of Operations
     ---------------------

          The Company's most significant operations are its insurance
     businesses, where it is a specialty markets provider of property and
     casualty and life insurance to its niche markets.  For the year ended
     December 31, 1994, the Company's insurance segments contributed 79% of
     total revenues and, at December 31, 1994, constituted 78% of total
     assets.

          Earned premium revenues and commissions of the property and
     casualty insurance operations of the Empire Group were approximately
     $299,200,000 in 1994, $259,400,000 in 1993 and $243,100,000 in 1992. 
     The increase in 1994 principally resulted from growth in policies in
     force, while the increase in 1993 was attributable to a combination of
     increased premium rates and increased insurance in force.

          Earned premium revenues of the Colonial Penn P&C Group were
     approximately $447,200,000 in 1994, $452,600,000 in 1993 and
     $456,000,000 in 1992.  The decline in earned premiums principally
     reflects the Company's strategy to substantially reduce the marketing
     programs employed prior to acquisition, which the Company believes
     were not justified by prior operating results.  The Company's current
     marketing efforts have resulted in new business, which to some degree
     has offset the normal attrition of existing business.  Additionally,
     the rate of decline in policies in force has slowed in each year since
     acquisition of the Colonial Penn P&C Group.  The Company believes that
     new business generated in 1995 will exceed lapsed business, although
     there can be no assurance that this will be achieved.  Earned premiums
     in 1994 and 1993 also reflect an increase, as compared to the prior
     year, resulting from acquired blocks of automobile assigned risk
     business from other insurance companies.

          The Company's property and casualty insurance operations combined
     ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were as follows:

              1993                                  96.9%      93.7%
              1992                                 101.7%     102.8%

</TABLE>

          The provision for insurance losses and policy benefits includes
     natural catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, estimated
     at approximately $18,300,000, $10,900,000 and $12,300,000 for the
     years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The 1994
     losses include approximately $11,700,000 related to the Northridge,
     California earthquake and the 1992 losses include approximately
     $6,000,000 related to Hurricane Andrew.  

          In addition to higher catastrophe losses, the combined ratio for
     1994 increased as compared to 1993 principally due to settlements in
     1993 of Colonial Penn P&C Group prior years claims at amounts less
     than provided.  The Company believes this experience reflects its
     improved underwriting procedures, emphasis on mature adult insureds,
     prior rate increases and improved claims handling and settlement
     practices.  Although Colonial Penn's loss experience continued to
     develop favorably in 1994, the Company believes that as a result

                                        29<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     of the reduction in claims outstanding, there will be a reduced
     positive effect on future results of operations from claim
     settlements, in spite of providing loss reserves on current operations
     at conservative levels.  The increase in the 1994 combined ratio was
     partially offset by increased fee income related to acquired blocks of
     automobile assigned risk business.  Loss experience for 1992 included
     a $3,000,000 retroactive assessment for a workers' compensation fund
     applicable to the Empire Group.

          Premium revenue receipts on IOP products of the life insurance
     subsidiaries (which are not reflected as revenues) were approximately
     $108,080,000 in 1994, $88,312,000 in 1993 and $68,035,000 in 1992. 
     The principal IOP product sold during the three year period ended
     December 31, 1994 was a variable annuity product marketed directly to
     consumers.  

          Earned premium revenues of the life and health insurance
     operations were approximately $172,400,000 for 1994, $181,800,000 for
     1993 and $233,700,000 for 1992.  The decline in earned premium
     revenues reflect the run-off of the agent sold Medicare supplement
     business, which the Company ceased marketing at December 31, 1992 due
     to inadequate profitability.  In addition, the Company terminated
     certain assumed life and health reinsurance contracts which had
     revenues of approximately $28,750,000 for 1992 and minimal
     profitability.

          During 1992 the Company concluded that it would be able to
     generate significant new premiums for its Graded Benefit Life business
     at acquisition cost levels that result in adequate profitability. 
     Accordingly, the Company increased its marketing efforts with respect
     to this product.  Earned premiums for this product were $113,700,000,
     $109,800,000 and $109,600,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994,
     1993 and 1992, respectively.

          Insurance losses, policy benefits and amortization of deferred
     acquisition costs of the life and health insurance operations were
     $138,300,000, $179,100,000 and $261,300,000 for the years ended
     December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The decrease reflects
     the run-off of the agent sold Medicare supplement business and also
     reflects improved loss experience in this business during 1994.  In
     addition, due to expectations of decreased or inadequate future
     profitability of its Single Premium Deferred Annuity ("SPDA") and
     Single Premium Whole Life ("SPWL") products, in 1992 and 1993 the
     Company sold blocks of such business or otherwise made permitted
     exchanges, which substantially reduced the amount of remaining
     policies.  The SPWL business was reinsured in 1993, resulting in a net
     pre-tax gain of approximately $16,700,000.  Such net pre-tax gain
     consisted of net security gains on investments sold in connection with
     the transaction (approximately $24,100,000), which are included in the
     caption "Net securities gains (losses)," reduced by a net loss of
     approximately $7,400,000 (principally the write-off of deferred policy
     acquisition costs of approximately $26,900,000, less the premium
     received on the transaction), which is included in the caption
     "Insurance losses, policy benefits and amortization of deferred
     acquisition costs."

          During 1993, the Company reinvested proceeds from sales of
     certain securities at the lower prevailing interest rates.  Since
     these reinvestment rates were, in certain instances, lower than had
     previously been expected on certain fixed rate annuity policies, the
     Company recorded an additional provision for insurance losses in the
     amount of $6,800,000.

          Principally starting in the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company
     realized security gains and reinsured or exchanged a substantial
     portion of its SPDA business.  The Company also reinvested proceeds
     from security sales at prevailing interest rates lower than had been
     expected on certain fixed income products.  In connection with these
     transactions, the Company recorded an additional provision for
     insurance losses and policy benefits of approximately $13,900,000,
     principally from the elimination of deferred policy acquisition costs. 
     In addition, as a result of the termination of certain reinsurance
     agreements in 1992, the provision for insurance


                                        30<PAGE>

     losses and policy benefits was reduced by approximately $6,200,000,
     representing amounts that were no longer required. 

          Although manufacturing revenues in 1994 were higher than in each
     of 1993 and 1992, gross profit declined significantly, principally at
     the bathroom vanities division.  This division has experienced
     manufacturing inefficiencies during the last three years that, in
     combination with pricing pressures and provisions for obsolete
     inventory, have resulted in operating losses.  During 1994, the
     Company commenced a restructuring program of this division to
     reevaluate and reduce existing product lines, to review the
     manufacturing process and to reduce overhead.  The Company is unable
     to predict if this division's restructuring efforts will result in a
     return to profitability.

          Trading stamps revenues declined in each of the last three years
     principally due to the loss of business of certain customers.  The
     Company believes that the historical decline in usage of trading
     stamps will continue.  The Company provided the liability for
     unredeemed trading stamps based on the estimate that approximately 75%
     of stamps sold in each of the last three years ultimately will be
     redeemed.  In early 1993, the Company contributed the net assets of
     its motivation services business to a new joint venture formed with an
     unrelated motivation services company in exchange for a 45% equity
     interest in the joint venture.  The joint venture is recorded on the
     equity basis of accounting.  Results of operations of the motivation
     services business have not been material.

          Finance revenues reflect the level of consumer instalment loans,
     which increased during 1994 as discussed above.  The operating profit
     applicable to this segment increased in 1993 as compared to 1992 due
     to the 1992 sale of certain consumer loan development offices which
     had operated at a loss.

          Investment and other income was substantially unchanged in 1994
     as compared to 1993 and lower in both years as compared to 1992. 
     Investment and other income reflects the lower level of investments
     due to the disposition of the SPWL and SPDA business and lower
     interest rates in both 1994 and 1993.  Other income in 1994 includes
     $8,458,000 related to the disposition of the El Salvador government
     bonds receivable and $14,500,000 related to the sale of the Company's
     remaining shares in Bolivian Power.  Other income in 1993 includes a
     $12,981,000 gain from the sale of a portion of the investment in
     Bolivian Power and other income in 1992 includes a $12,128,000 gain
     from sale of certain consumer loan development offices.  

          Net securities gains (losses) were ($12,004,000), $51,923,000 and
     $51,778,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
     respectively.  Realized security losses during 1994 principally
     reflected the Company's strategy to further shorten the duration of
     its investment portfolio during a time of rising interest rates. 
     Security gains in 1993 and 1992 were realized, in part, to effect the
     reinsurance and transfer of the SPWL and SPDA businesses described
     above.  The decision to exit these businesses also resulted in write-
     downs of deferred policy acquisition costs and additional provisions
     for policyholder benefits, which do not reduce security gains but do
     reduce pre-tax income.  As described above, in 1993, reserves for
     policyholder benefits were also increased for certain fixed rate
     annuity policies because the proceeds from security sales were
     reinvested at rates lower than previously expected.  Net securities
     gains (losses) include provisions for write-downs of investments of
     $3,126,000, $2,000,000 and $20,041,000 for the years ended December
     31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

          Higher interest expense in each of 1994 and 1993 compared to the
     prior year principally reflects the increased level of borrowings
     outstanding.  Interest expense also reflects the level of deposits at
     AIB and AIF.  Generally, interest rates on deposits are lower than on
     other available funds.  Interest expense on deposits was approximately
     $8,304,000 in 1994, $9,001,000 in 1993 and $11,954,000 in 1992.

          The provisions for income taxes for 1994 and 1993 were calculated
     under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting
     for Income Taxes", which does not reflect the benefit from utilization
     of tax loss carryforwards.  The provision for income taxes for 1992
     has been reduced for the benefit from utilization of tax loss
     carryforwards.  The provision for income taxes for 1994 and 1993 is
     below the expected normal corporate income tax rate principally
     because of a reduction in the valuation allowance applicable to the
     deferred tax asset due to the resolution of certain contingencies.  In
     addition, the provision for income taxes for 1993 was reduced by
     approximately $4,215,000 as a result of changes in federal income tax
     rates.

          The provision for income taxes for 1992 principally consists of
     state income taxes, the federal alternative minimum income tax and
     federal income taxes applicable to the life insurance subsidiaries
     which cannot utilize the Company's tax loss carryforwards.  As noted
     above, the tax provision for 1992 also reflects the benefit from
     utilization of tax loss carryforwards.

          The number of shares used to calculate primary earnings per share
     was 29,101,000, 29,270,000 and 24,435,000 for 1994, 1993 and 1992,
     respectively.  The number of shares used to calculate fully diluted
     earnings per share was 30,857,000, 30,743,000 and 24,516,000 for 1994,
     1993 and 1992, respectively.  The increase in 1994 and 1993 as
     compared to 1992 was principally caused by the acquisition of the
     minority interest in Phlcorp and, with respect to fully diluted per
     share amounts, the effect of the assumed conversion of the Company's 
     5 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



     To the Board of Directors of Leucadia National Corporation:

     We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the
     financial statement schedules of LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION and
     SUBSIDIARIES listed in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K.  These financial
     statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
     the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
     on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based
     on our audits. 

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
     standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
     to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
     are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
     test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
     financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
     principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
     as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
     believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
     fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
     of LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31,
     1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results of their operations and
     their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
     December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
     principles.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
     schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic
     financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
     respects, the information required to be included therein.

     As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, in
     1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for Income Taxes,
     Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, Postemployment Benefits,
     Re-insurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts, Multiple-
     Year Retrospectively Rated Contracts, and Certain Investments in Debt
     and Capital Securities, all as set forth in various pronouncements of
     the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Emerging Issues Task
     Force.

     LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     1.  Significant Accounting Policies:
         -------------------------------

     (a) Consolidation Policy:  The consolidated financial statements
         --------------------
     include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned
     subsidiaries.  The Company has certain legal subsidiaries (the "WMAC
     Companies") which are under the control of the Wisconsin Insurance
     Commissioner (the "Commissioner").  These companies are not
     consolidated while under the control of the Commissioner.

     Investments in entities in which the Company owns less than 50% of the
     voting interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence
     are accounted for on the equity method of accounting.  Amounts related
     to such companies have not been material.

     Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to be
     consistent with the 1994 presentation.

     (b) Statement of Cash Flows:  The Company considers short-term
         -----------------------
     investments, which have maturities of less than three months at the
     time of acquisition, to be cash equivalents.  Cash and cash
     equivalents include short-term investments of $200,232,000 and
     $247,583,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     On December 31, 1992, the Company acquired the minority interest in
     Phlcorp, Inc. ("Phlcorp") for approximately 4,408,000 of the Company's
     Common Shares, which were recorded at an aggregate cost of
     approximately $142,927,000.  The cost of the acquisition was
     principally allocated to investments in associated companies
     (approximately $11,022,000), amounts related to the WMAC Companies
     (approximately $16,847,000), excess of purchase price over net assets
     acquired (approximately $22,277,000) and to eliminate the minority
     interest in Phlcorp (approximately $92,819,000).

     On June 1, 1993, the Company received 224,175 of the Company's Common
     Shares (valued at $8,294,000) in settlement of a zero coupon note due
     from John W. Jordan II, a director of the Company and a significant
     shareholder.  The value of the shares received, which was based on the
     market price on the date of the transaction, was equal to the maturity
     value of the note.

     (c) Investments:  Effective as of December 31, 1993, the Company
         -----------
     adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
     "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities"
     ("SFAS 115").  The adoption of SFAS 115 resulted in an increase in
     reported shareholders' equity of approximately $49,500,000 at December
     31, 1993.  

     At acquisition, marketable debt and equity securities are designated
     as either i) held to maturity, which are carried at amortized cost,
     ii) trading, which are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized
     gains and losses reflected in results of operations, or iii) available
     for sale, which are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized
     gains and losses reflected as a separate component of shareholders'
     equity, net of taxes.  Held to maturity investments are made with the
     intention of holding such securities to maturity, which the Company
     has the ability to do.  Estimated fair values are principally based on
     quoted market prices.











                                      F-7

<PAGE>
     1.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
         -------------------------------

     Investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than
     temporary are written down to estimated net realizable values.  The
     writedowns are included in "Net securities gains (losses)" in the
     Consolidated Statements of Income.  The cost of securities sold is
     based on average cost.  

     While the adoption of SFAS 115 did not have, and is not expected to
     have, a material effect on results of operations, the Company believes
     SFAS 115 is likely to result in substantial fluctuations in
     shareholders' equity, as occurred in 1994.  During 1994, principally
     as a result of increases in market interest rates, the unrealized gain
     on investments reported in shareholders' equity at December 31, 1993
     of $49,912,000 (net of taxes) became an unrealized loss of $41,309,000
     (net of taxes) as of December 31, 1994.  

     The Company's investments in Russian equity securities (approximately
     $19,600,000 as of December 31, 1994), none of which is held by its
     insurance or banking subsidiaries, do not have readily determinable
     fair values as defined by SFAS 115.  Given the uncertainties inherent
     in investing in the emerging markets of Russia, the Company is
     accounting for these investments under the cost recovery method,
     whereby all receipts are applied to reduce the investment.  These
     investments are included in "Other investments" in the Consolidated
     Balance Sheets.

     (d) Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements:  Property,
         ----------------------------------------------
     equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of
     accumulated depreciation and amortization (approximately $87,067,000
     and $73,640,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively). 
     Depreciation and amortization are provided principally on the
     straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or,
     if less, the term of the underlying lease.  

     (e) Income Recognition from Insurance Operations:  Premiums on
         --------------------------------------------
     property and casualty and health insurance products are recognized as
     revenues over the term of the policy using the monthly pro rata basis.

     The life insurance subsidiaries have sold various investment oriented
     insurance products (collectively the "IOP products"), including single
     premium whole life ("SPWL") products, a variable life ("VL") product,
     a variable annuity ("VA") product and a single premium deferred
     annuity ("SPDA") product.  The principal IOP product offered during
     the three year period ended December 31, 1994 was a VA product.  IOP
     product premiums are reflected in a manner similar to a deposit;
     revenues reflect only mortality charges and other amounts assessed
     against the holder of the insurance policies and annuity contracts. 
     Other life premiums are recognized as revenues over the premium paying
     period.

     Premiums for the VA and VL products are directed by the policyholder
     to be invested in a unit trust solely for the benefit and risk of the
     policyholder.  Policyholders' accounts are charged for the cost of
     insurance provided, administrative and certain other charges.  The
     amount included in the balance sheet liability caption "Separate and
     variable accounts" represents the current value of the policyholders'
     funds.

<PAGE>

     1.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
         -------------------------------

     (f) Policy Acquisition Costs:  Policy acquisition costs principally
         ------------------------
     consist of direct response marketing costs, commissions, premium taxes
     and other underwriting expenses (net of reinsurance allowances).  If 
     recoverability of such costs from future premiums and related
     investment income is not anticipated, the amounts not considered
     recoverable are charged to operations.  Deferred policy acquisition
     costs also have been charged to operations in connection with
     dispositions of blocks of business or reinvestment of proceeds from
     security sales at prevailing lower interest rates.  

     Policy acquisition costs applicable to the property and casualty
     insurance operations are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms
     of the related policies.  Policy acquisition costs applicable to IOP
     products are deferred and amortized as a level percentage of the
     present value of expected gross profits over the estimated life of
     each policy.  Policy acquisition costs applicable to other life
     insurance products are amortized over the expected premium paying
     period of the policies.

     (g) Reinsurance:  In the normal course of business, the Company seeks
         -----------
     to reduce the loss that may arise from catastrophes and to limit
     losses from large exposures by reinsuring certain levels of risk with
     other insurance enterprises.  The Company has also entered into
     reinsurance transactions in connection with dispositions of blocks of
     businesses.  Reinsurance contracts do not necessarily relieve the
     Company from its obligations to policyholders. 

     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standards No. 113, "Accounting and Reporting for
     Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts" ("SFAS
     113").  Under SFAS 113 reinsurance recoverables are reported as assets
     rather than the previously accepted practice of netting such amounts
     against related liabilities.  Appropriate provisions are made for
     uncollectible reinsurance receivables.  Premiums earned and other
     underwriting expenses are stated net of reinsurance in the
     Consolidated Statements of Income.  The adoption of SFAS 113 had no
     material effect on results of operations.

     (h) Policy Reserves and Unearned Premiums:  Policy reserves and
         -------------------------------------
     unearned premiums for life, health and traditional annuity policies
     are computed on a net level premium method based upon standard and
     Company developed tables with provision for adverse deviation and
     estimated withdrawals.  Liabilities for unpaid losses and loss
     adjustment expenses applicable to the property and casualty insurance
     operations are determined using case basis evaluations, statistical
     analyses for losses incurred but not reported and estimates for
     salvage and subrogation recoverable and represent estimates of
     ultimate claim costs and loss adjustment expenses.

     Effective as of January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Financial
     Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No.
     93-6, "Accounting for Multiple Year Retrospectively Rated Contracts by
     Ceding and Assuming Enterprises" ("EITF 93-6"), which specifies the
     accounting for certain retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements.

<PAGE>

     1.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
         -------------------------------

     As a result of the adoption of EITF 93-6, the Company reduced its policy
     reserves at January 1, 1993 by approximately $14,654,000 and recorded
     a credit of approximately $9,672,000 (net of income taxes of
     $4,982,000) which is included in the caption "Cumulative effects of
     changes in accounting principles."  If the accounting specified by
     EITF 93-6 had been in effect in 1992, the effect on results of
     continuing operations would not have been material.

     (i) Trading Stamp Revenue and Liability for Unredeemed Trading Stamps: 
         -----------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company records trading stamp revenues and provides for the cost
     of redemptions at the time trading stamps are sold to licensees.  A
     liability for unredeemed trading stamps is estimated based upon the
     cost of merchandise, cash and related redemption service expenses
     required to redeem the trading stamps which are expected to be
     presented for redemption in the future.  The Company periodically
     reviews the appropriateness of the estimated redemption rates based
     upon recent experience, statistical evaluations and other relevant
     factors.  The most recent statistical studies of trading stamp
     redemptions have indicated that the historical pattern of redemptions
     has changed and that the recorded liability for unredeemed trading
     stamps is in excess of the amount that ultimately will be required to
     redeem trading stamps outstanding.  The amount of the excess may be
     different than indicated by these studies.  Accordingly, the Company
     has been amortizing the aggregate apparent excess over a five year
     period.  As a result, cost of goods sold applicable to the trading
     stamp operations reflects a credit of approximately $11,700,000,
     $11,900,000 and $14,100,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994,
     1993 and 1992, respectively.  Based on the latest studies, the
     unamortized apparent excess at December 31, 1994 was approximately
     $5,358,000.  The Company provided the liability for unredeemed trading
     stamps based on the estimate that approximately 75% of stamps sold in
     each of the three years ended December 31, 1994 ultimately will be
     redeemed.

     (j) Pension, Postemployment and Postretirement Costs:  The Company has
         ------------------------------------------------
     non-contributory trusteed pension plans covering certain employees,
     which generally provide retirement benefits based on salary and length
     of service.  The plans are funded in amounts sufficient to satisfy
     minimum ERISA funding requirements.

     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
     Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" ("SFAS 106") and
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers'
     Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" ("SFAS 112"),  which require
     accruals for benefits that previously had been expensed as incurred. 
     The Company does not expect SFAS 106 and SFAS 112 to have a material
     effect on results of operations.

     (k) Income Taxes:  The Company provides for income taxes using the
         ------------
     liability method.  Effective as of January 1, 1993, the Company
     adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
     "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109").  Under the liability
     method, deferred income taxes are provided at the statutorily enacted
     rates for differences between the tax and accounting bases of
     substantially all assets and 












                                      F-10

<PAGE>

     1.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
         -------------------------------

     liabilities and for carryforwards.  A valuation allowance is provided
     if deferred tax assets are not considered more likely than not to be
     realized.

     Prior to adoption of SFAS 109, the benefit from utilization of tax
     loss carryforwards and future deductions was only recognized when
     utilized and under certain other limited circumstances.  Under SFAS
     109, the future benefit of certain tax loss carryforwards and future
     deductions is recorded as an asset and the provisions for income taxes
     for periods ending after December 31, 1992 are not reduced for the
     benefit from utilization of tax loss carryforwards.  Accordingly,
     provisions for income taxes for 1994 and 1993 are not comparable to
     the 1992 provision.

     (l) Derivative Financial Instruments:  The Company has entered into
         --------------------------------
     interest rate swap and interest rate option agreements to reduce the
     impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt.  The
     difference between the amounts paid and received is accrued as an
     adjustment to interest expense over the term of the agreements.  The
     premiums paid for interest rate option agreements are included in
     other assets and are amortized to expense over the term of the
     agreements.  The Company does not have material derivative financial
     instruments for trading purposes.

     (m) Translation of Foreign Currency:  Foreign currency denominated
         -------------------------------
     investments which are not subject to hedging agreements and currency
     rate swap agreements not meeting the accounting requirements for
     hedges, are converted into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at
     the end of the period.  Resulting net exchange gains or losses were
     not material.

     2.  Acquisitions:
         ------------

     The Company is a partner in The Jordan Company and Jordan/Zalaznick
     Capital Company, private investment firms whose principal activity is
     structuring leveraged buy-outs in which the partners are given the
     opportunity to become equity participants.  John W. Jordan II, a
     director of the Company and a significant shareholder, is a Managing
     Partner of both firms.  Since 1982, through such partnerships, the
     Company acquired interests in several companies (the "Jordan
     Associated Companies"), principally engaged in various aspects of
     manufacturing and distribution.  The Company currently accounts for
     its interests in fifteen of the Jordan Associated Companies on the
     cost method of accounting and one company, which is not material, on
     the equity method of accounting.  The investments acquired as a result
     of the partnership interests are considered Associated Companies.

     Prior to December 31, 1992, the Company owned approximately 63% of
     Phlcorp's common shares.  On December 31, 1992, pursuant to a merger
     agreement, Phlcorp merged with a subsidiary of the Company and became
     a wholly owned subsidiary.  Pursuant to the terms of the merger, the
     Company issued 4,408,000 of the Company's Common Shares, which were
     recorded at approximately $142,927,000.

          Fully diluted                                          $5.20

</TABLE>

     Such pro forma data should not necessarily be considered indicative of
     future results of operations or the results of operations that would
     have resulted if the acquisition had actually occurred on January 1,
     1992.

     In April 1994, the Company acquired a 30% interest in Caja de Ahorro y
     Seguro S.A. ("Caja") from the government of Argentina for a
     preliminary purchase price of approximately $46,000,000, including
     costs.  Caja is a holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in
     property and casualty insurance, life insurance and banking in
     Argentina.  The preliminary purchase price is subject to adjustment
     based upon the reduction in Caja's net assets from December 31, 1993
     to the acquisition date.

     The difference between the Company's investment in Caja and its share
     of Caja's underlying net tangible assets is being amortized over 20
     years.  Since acquisition, the Company's equity in the earnings of
     Caja has not been material.  The Company's investment in Caja is
     included in the caption "Investments in associated companies."

     In May 1994, the Company acquired a 615,000 square foot office
     building located near Grand Central Terminal in New York City for
     approximately $50,800,000.  The building has approximately 355,000
     square feet of contiguous space available for occupancy.  After
     certain improvements to the building are completed, the Company
     intends to lease the available space.  The investment is included in
     other assets.

     In July 1994, the Company acquired HSD Venture, a California general
     partnership which was in reorganization proceedings under chapter 11
     of the Bankruptcy Code, for approximately $42,000,000.  HSD Venture is
     the developer and owner of two luxury condominium towers in downtown
     San Diego, California.  The property includes approximately 202
     residential units, of which approximately 180 are available for sale,
     and approximately 42,000 square feet of retail space.  The real estate
     investment is included in other assets.

     3.  Investments in Associated Companies:
         -----------------------------------

     The Company owns or held part interests in the following foreign power
     companies:  Compania de Alumbrado Electrico de San Salvador, S.A.
     ("CAESS"), Compania Boliviana de Energia Electrica, S.A. - Bolivian

     3.  Investments in Associated Companies, continued:
         -----------------------------------

     Power Company Limited ("Bolivian Power") and, through the Canadian
     International Power Company Limited Liquidating Trust, The Barbados
     Light and Power Company Limited.

     In March 1993, in settlement of claims related to El Salvador's 1986 
     seizure of CAESS's assets, the Company received cash of approximately 
     $5,300,000 and approximately $12,000,000 principal amount of 6% U.S.
     dollar denominated El Salvador Government bonds due in instalments 
     through 1996.  The Company has recognized the gain on the cash basis. 
     During 1994, the Company disposed of the remaining bonds and reported
     a pre-tax gain of approximately $8,458,000, which is included in the
     caption "Investment and other income."  Gains recognized in 1993 were
     not significant.

     During 1993, the Company sold 750,000 shares of Bolivian Power common
     stock in an underwritten public offering and realized a pre-tax gain
     of approximately $12,981,000.  During 1994, the Company sold its
     remaining interest in Bolivian Power to an unaffiliated party and
     realized a pre-tax gain of approximately $14,500,000.  The gains are
     reflected in the caption, "Investment and other income."  

     The Company believes that it ultimately will receive the stock of two
     of the WMAC Companies; however, the timing of such receipt is
     uncertain.  The Company estimates that the fair value of the net
     tangible assets yet to be received is approximately $34,000,000 in
     excess of their recorded cost at December 31, 1994.

     On June 23, 1993, the Company reinsured substantially all of its
     existing SPWL business with a subsidiary of John Hancock Mutual Life
     Insurance Company ("John Hancock").  In connection with the

         --------------------

     Company realized a net pre-tax gain of approximately $16,700,000
     during 1993.  Such net pre-tax gain consists of net security gains on
     investments sold in connection with the transaction (approximately
     $24,100,000), which are included in the caption "Net securities gains
     (losses)," reduced by a net loss of approximately $7,400,000
     (principally the write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs of
     approximately $26,900,000 less the premium received on the
     transaction) which is included in the caption "Insurance losses,
     policy benefits and amortization of deferred acquisition costs."  For
     financial reporting purposes, the Company reflects the policy
     liabilities assumed by John Hancock in policy reserves, with an
     offsetting receivable from John Hancock of the same amount in
     reinsurance receivable, net, until the Company is relieved of its
     legal obligation to the SPWL policyholders.  At December 31, 1994,
     reinsurance receivables, net includes approximately $179,452,000 due
     from John Hancock.  During 1994, the Company was legally relieved of
     approximately $157,818,000 of SPWL policy liabilities.

     During 1993 and 1992, the Company sold, at gains, substantial amounts
     of investments, including dispositions in connection with the transfer
     of blocks of business, and, in certain cases, reinvested proceeds at
     prevailing lower interest rates.  Since certain of these rates were
     lower than had previously been expected on certain fixed rate annuity
     policies, the Company provided additional reserves of approximately
     $6,800,000 in 1993 and $2,700,000 in 1992.  In addition, because of
     the lower anticipated investment earnings, the Company also
     recalculated deferred policy acquisition costs and provided additional
     amounts for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of
     $2,100,000 in 1992.

     ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 is as follows (in thousands):

     Recoveries recognized on reinsurance contracts were approximately
     $44,300,000 in 1994 and $22,800,000 in 1993.

     Reinsurance receivables are net of allowance for doubtful accounts of
     approximately $4,046,000 and $83,825,000 at December 31, 1994 and
     1993, respectively.  The decrease in the allowance from 1993
     principally reflects the write-off of reinsurance receivables that had
     been fully reserved.

     Certain insurance subsidiaries are owned by other insurance
     subsidiaries.  In the data above, investments in such subsidiary-owned
     insurance companies are reflected in statutory surplus of both the
     parent and subsidiary-owned insurance company.  As a result, at
     December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, statutory surplus of approximately
     $252,800,000, $246,600,000 and $122,000,000, respectively, related to
     property and casualty operations is also included in the statutory
     surplus of the life insurance parent and statutory surplus of
     approximately $35,900,000, $42,200,000 and $38,000,000, respectively,
     related to life operations is also included in the statutory surplus
     of the property and casualty insurance parent.  The insurance
     subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions which limit the
     amount of cash and other distributions available to the Company
     without regulatory approval.  At December 31, 1994, approximately
     $21,134,000 could be distributed to the Company without regulatory
     approval.

     The Colonial Penn property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are
     subject to a rate "roll-back" refund on California insurance premiums
     for certain pre-acquisition years.  In November 1994, Colonial Penn
     received an order requiring it to refund $35,300,000, plus $21,700,000
     of interest.  Colonial Penn disagrees with the calculation of this
     assessment.  The Company is in discussions with the California
     Department of Insurance and has filed a request for a formal hearing
     should informal discussions fail to come to a satisfactory conclusion. 
     The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of this matter will
     not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
     condition or results of operations and will not exceed reserves
     established in prior years.

     The Company's insurance subsidiaries are contingently liable for
     possible assessments under state regulatory requirements pertaining to
     potential insolvencies of unaffiliated insurance companies. 
     Liabilities, which are established based upon regulatory guidance,
     have not been material.

         --------------------------------

     Credit agreements provide for aggregate contractual credit facilities
     of $150,000,000 and bear interest based on the prime rate or LIBOR,
     plus commitment and other fees.  Such credit facilities were renewed
     in 1994 and expire in June 1997.

     In June 1994, the Company entered into a $50,000,000 five-year term
     loan agreement with certain of its bank lenders.  The loan bears
     interest based on the prime rate or LIBOR.

     Approximately $15,665,000 of the manufacturing division's net
     property, equipment and leasehold improvements are pledged as
     collateral for the Industrial Revenue Bonds; and approximately
     $6,493,000 of other assets (primarily property) is pledged for other
     indebtedness aggregating approximately $4,264,000.

     Interest rate swap and interest rate option agreements are used to
     reduce the potential impact of increases in interest rates on term
     loans with banks, customer banking deposits and credit agreement
     borrowings.  Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Company has
     agreed with other parties to pay fixed rate interest amounts and
     receive variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an
     agreed notional amount.  The variable interest rate portion of the
     swaps is a specified LIBOR interest rate.  Swaps that expire in 1996
     require fixed rate payments of 7.23% on a $50,000,000 notional amount. 
     Swaps that expire in 1999 require fixed rate payments of 7.33% on a
     $25,000,000 notional amount.  The weighted average LIBOR rate at
     December 31, 1994 is 5.9%.  Changes in LIBOR interest rates in the
     future will change the amounts to be received under the agreements.

     In 1994, the Company purchased an option for $2,564,000 to enter into
     an interest rate swap, which is exercisable in August 1996.  If
     exercised, the Company would be required to make fixed rate payments
     of 7.64% in exchange for receiving a LIBOR based variable payment on a
     $50,000,000 notional amount for the subsequent eight year term.

     Counterparties to interest rate swap agreements are major financial
     institutions, which management believes are able to fulfill their
     obligations.  However, any losses due to default by the counterparties
     would be immaterial.

     During 1989, the Company entered into long-term hedging transactions
     whereby substantially all currency rate risk related to the Swiss
     Franc Bonds was eliminated and the cost of which increased the cost of
     the issue to approximately 10.4%.

     The 5 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2003 are
     convertible into Common Shares at $57.50 per Common Share, an
     aggregate of 1,739,130 Common Shares, subject to anti-dilution
     provisions.

     The most restrictive of the Company's debt instruments require
     maintenance of minimum Tangible Net Worth and limit Indebtedness, as
     defined in the agreements.  In addition, the debt instruments contain
     limitations on dividends, investments, liens, contingent obligations
     and certain other matters.  As of January 1, 1995, cash dividends of
     approximately $187,800,000 could be paid under the most restrictive
     covenants.

     The aggregate annual mandatory redemptions of debt during the five year 
     period ending December 31, 1999 are as follows (in thousands): 
     1995 - $3,966; 1996 - $35,797; 1997 - $1,580; 1998 - $1,498; and, 1999
     - $51,197.

     The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings (primarily
     customer banking deposits) was 5.4% and 4.7% at December 31, 1994 and
     1993, respectively.

     10.  Common Shares, Stock Options, Warrants and Preferred Shares:
          -----------------------------------------------------------

     The Board of Directors from time to time has authorized acquisitions
     of the Company's Common Shares.  Pursuant to such authorization,
     during the three year period ended December 31, 1994, the Company
     acquired 405,195 Common Shares (11,986 shares in 1994, 282,409 shares
     in 1993 and 110,800 shares in 1992) at an average price of $34.82 per
     Common Share.  The Common Shares acquired in 1993, include 224,175
     Common Shares acquired from John W. Jordan II.

     A summary of activity with respect to the Company's stock options for
     the three years ended December 31, 1994 is as follows:

     The valuation allowance principally relates to certain acquired tax
     loss carryforwards, the usage of which is subject to certain
     limitations and certain other matters which may restrict their
     availability, and unrealized capital losses.  In addition, the amounts
     reflected above are

     based on the minimum tax loss carryforwards of Phlcorp and certain
     proposed regulations affecting the use of Phlcorp's tax loss
     carryforwards.  As described more fully herein, substantial additional
     amounts may be available under certain circumstances and as
     uncertainties are resolved.  

     The Company believes it is more likely than not that the recorded
     deferred tax asset will be realized principally from taxable income
     generated by profitable operations.

     The provisions for income taxes for 1994 and 1993 were calculated
     under SFAS 109.  Accordingly, the provisions for 1994 and 1993 are not
     comparable to the 1992 provision.

     The valuation allowance applicable to the deferred income tax asset
     recorded upon adoption of SFAS 109 gave effect to the possible
     unavailability of certain income tax deductions.  During 1994 and 1993
     certain matters were resolved and the Company reduced the valuation
     allowance as reflected in the above reconciliation.

     Adoption of SFAS 109 at January 1, 1993 was principally reflected as

     Phlcorp, in connection with its 1986 reorganization, entered into a
     tax settlement agreement (the "Tax Settlement Agreement") with the
     United States whereby, among other things, Phlcorp agreed that upon
     utilization of certain pre-reorganization tax loss carryforwards, it
     would pay 25% of any resultant tax savings to the government, subject
     to certain limitations.  The Tax Settlement Agreement provides that
     post-reorganization tax attributes and net operating losses will be
     utilized prior to pre-reorganization operating losses in calculating
     tax sharing payments.  Due to unresolved issues concerning certain
     post-reorganization deductions, Phlcorp is unable to state with
     certainty the amount of its available carryforwards.  However, Phlcorp
     believes that it has minimum tax operating loss carryforwards of
     between $95,000,000 and $260,000,000 at December 31, 1994.  The
     expiration dates for Phlcorp's carryforwards will depend on the
     outcome of the matters referred to above, although it is unlikely such
     carryforwards will begin to expire before 1998.

     Limitations exist under the tax law which may restrict the utilization
     of the Phlcorp carryforwards and the utilization of an aggregate of
     approximately $6,471,000 of non-Phlcorp tax loss carryforwards. 
     Further, certain of the future deductions may only be utilized in the
     tax returns of certain life insurance subsidiaries.  These limitations
     are considered in the determination of the valuation allowance.

     Under certain circumstances, the value of the carryforwards available
     could be substantially reduced if certain changes in ownership were to
     occur.  In order to reduce this possibility, the Company's certificate
     of incorporation was amended to include certain charter restrictions
     which prohibit transfers of the Company's Common Stock under certain
     circumstances.

     Under prior law, Charter National had accumulated approximately
     $15,447,000 of special federal income tax deductions allowed life
     insurance companies as of December 31, 1994 and the Colonial Penn life
     insurance subsidiaries had accumulated approximately $161,000,000 of
     such special deductions.  Under certain conditions, such amounts could
     become taxable in future periods.  Except with respect to amounts
     applicable to Colonial Penn's life insurance subsidiaries, for which
     the previous owner has assumed such liability contractually, the
     Company does not anticipate any transaction occurring which would
     cause these amounts to become taxable.  In connection with the IRS's
     examination of certain pre-acquisition tax returns of the Colonial
     Penn life insurance companies, the IRS has asserted that approximately
     $93,025,000 of special federal income tax deductions allowed life
     insurance companies should have been reflected in taxable income in
     1986, resulting in a tax (exclusive of interest and penalties) of
     approximately $42,792,000.  As noted above, the previous owner is
     contractually liable for any such taxes (including interest and
     penalties).  The previous owner has contested the IRS assessment.

        15.  Pension Plans and Other Postemployment and Postretirement
             ---------------------------------------------------------
             Benefits, continued:
             --------

     The plans' assets consist primarily of U.S. government and agencies'
     bonds.  The projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1994 and 1993
     was determined using an assumed discount rate of 8.0% and 7.0%,
     respectively, and an assumed compensation increase rate of 5.6% and
     5.9%, respectively.  The assumed long-term rate of return on plan
     assets was 7.4% and 7.3% at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     The Company also has defined contribution pension plans covering
     certain employees.  Contributions and costs are a percent of each
     covered employee's salary.  Amounts charged to expense related to such
     plans were $3,292,000, $2,066,000 and $2,106,000 for the years ended
     December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     Several subsidiaries provide certain health care and other benefits to
     certain retired employees.  The costs of such benefits prior to
     January 1, 1993 were generally expensed as incurred, although
     liabilities for benefits were recorded in connection with certain
     acquisitions.  SFAS 106 and SFAS 112 require companies to accrue the
     cost of providing certain postretirement and postemployment benefits
     during the employee's period of service.  Amounts charged to expense
     related to such benefits were $1,762,000 in 1994 (principally
     interest), $2,594,000 in 1993 (principally interest) and $1,527,000 in
     1992.



The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1994
and 1993 is as follows (in thousands):

</TABLE>

     The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement
     benefit obligation was 8% and 7% at December 31, 1994 and 1993,
     respectively.  The assumed health care cost trend rates used in
     measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were
     between approximately 8.4% and 15% for 1994 and approximately 8% and
     15% for 1993, declining to an ultimate rate of between 5.5% and 8% by
     2005.

     If the health care cost trend rates were increased by 1%, the
     accumulated postretirement obligation as of December 31, 1994 and 1993
     would have increased by approximately $1,335,000 and $1,404,000,
     respectively.  The effect of this change on the aggregate of service
     and interest cost for 1994 and 1993 would be immaterial.

     16.  Commitments:
          -----------

     The Company and its subsidiaries rent office space and office
     equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with terms generally
     varying from one to fifteen years.  Rental expense (net of sublease
     rental income) charged to operations was approximately $16,566,000 in
     1994, $17,555,000 in 1993 and $20,791,000 in 1992.  Aggregate minimum
     annual rentals (exclusive of real estate taxes, maintenance and
     certain other charges) and related minimum sublease rentals relating
     to facilities under lease in effect at December 31, 1994 were as

     In connection with the sale of certain subsidiaries, the Company has
     made or guaranteed the accuracy of certain representations given to
     the acquiror.  No material loss is expected in connection with such
     matters.

     Certain subsidiaries that were formerly under the control of the
     Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner have guaranteed the adequacy of
     certain other matters.  The maximum amount of such contingencies is
     approximately $5,000,000 at December 31, 1994.  The Company does not
     expect a material loss in connection with these guarantees.

     The insurance and the banking and lending subsidiaries are limited by
     regulatory requirements and agreements in the amount of dividends and
     other transfers of funds that are available to the Company. 
     Principally as a result of such restrictions, the net assets of
     subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to
     the Company were approximately $675,300,000 at December 31, 1994.

     17.  Litigation:
          ----------

     The Company is subject to various litigation which arises in the
     course of its business.  Based on discussions with counsel, management
     is of the opinion that such litigation will have no material adverse
     effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company or its
     consolidated results of operations.

     18.  Earnings Per Common Share:
          -------------------------

     Earnings per common and dilutive common equivalent share was
     calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average
     number of Common Shares outstanding and the incremental weighted
     average number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of options and
     warrants for the periods they were outstanding.  The number of common
     and dilutive common equivalent shares used for this calculation was
     29,101,000 in 1994, 29,270,000 in 1993 and 24,435,000 in 1992.

     18.  Earnings Per Common Share, continued:
          -------------------------

     Fully diluted earnings per share was calculated as described above
     except that in 1994 and 1992 the incremental number of shares utilized
     the year end market price for the Company's Common Shares, since the
     year end market price was above the average for the year.  In
     addition, in 1994 and 1993, the calculations assume the 5 1/4%
     Convertible Subordinated Debentures had been converted into Common
     Shares for the period they were outstanding and earnings increased for
     the interest on such debentures, net of the income tax effect.  The
     number of shares used for this calculation was 30,857,000 in 1994,
     30,743,000 in 1993 and 24,516,000 in 1992.

     19.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
          -----------------------------------

     The following table presents fair value information about certain
     financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the balance sheet. 
     Where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
     estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.  Those
     techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used,
     including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  The
     fair value amounts presented do not purport to represent and should
     not be considered representative of the underlying "market" or
     franchise value of the Company.  The methods and assumptions used to
     estimate the fair values of each class of the financial instruments
     described below are as follows:

     (a)  Investments:  The fair values of marketable equity securities and
     fixed maturity securities are substantially based on quoted market
     prices, as disclosed in Note 5.  It is not practicable to determine
     the fair value of policyholder loans since such loans generally have
     no stated maturity, are not separately transferable and are often
     repaid by reductions to benefits and surrenders.

     (b)  Cash and cash equivalents:  For cash equivalents, the carrying
     amount approximates fair value.

     (c)  Loans receivable of banking and lending subsidiaries:  The fair
     value of loans receivable of the banking and lending subsidiaries is
     estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates
     at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit
     ratings for the same remaining maturities.

     (d)  El Salvador Government bonds receivable, net of deferred gain: 
     The fair value of the bonds receivable at December 31, 1993 is based
     on estimated market prices.

     (e)  Separate and variable accounts:  Separate and variable accounts
     assets and liabilities are carried at market value, which is a
     reasonable estimate of fair value.

     (f)  Investments in associated companies:  The fair values of certain
     foreign power companies are principally estimated based upon quoted
     market prices.  The carrying value of the remaining investments in
     associated companies approximates fair value.

<PAGE>

     19.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments, continued:
          -----------------------------------

     (g)  The WMAC Companies:  The fair value of the WMAC Companies is
     estimated based upon the Company's assessment of the fair value of
     their underlying net tangible assets to be received.

     (h)  Derivatives:  The fair values of derivatives generally reflect
     the amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the
     interest rate and currency swap contracts.

     (i)  Customer banking deposits:  The fair value of customer banking
     deposits is estimated using rates currently offered for deposits of
     similar remaining maturities.

     (j)  Long-term and other indebtedness:  The fair values of
     non-variable rate debt are estimated using quoted market prices and
     estimated rates which would be available to the Company for debt with
     similar terms.  The fair value of variable rate debt is estimated to
     be the carrying amount.

     (k)  Investment contract reserves:  SPDA reserves are carried at
     account value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value.  The fair
     value of other investment contracts is estimated by discounting the
     future payments at rates which would currently be offered for
     contracts with similar terms.

     The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's
     financial instruments at December 31, 1994 and 1993 are as follows (in
     thousands):

     A.    The notes to consolidated financial statements of Leucadia National
           Corporation and Subsidiaries are incorporated by reference to this
           schedule.

     B.    The statements of shareholders' equity are the same as those
           presented for Leucadia National Corporation and Subsidiaries.

     C.    Equity in the income of the subsidiaries is after reflecting
           income taxes recorded by the subsidiaries.  In 1994, 1993 and
           1992, there was no provision for income taxes provided by the
           parent company. Tax sharing payments received from subsidiaries
           were $35,385,000 in 1994, $64,566,000 in 1993 and $38,773,000 in
           1992.

     D.    The deferred income tax assets of $144,631,000 and $114,001,000
           at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, have not been allocated
           to the individual subsidiaries.
