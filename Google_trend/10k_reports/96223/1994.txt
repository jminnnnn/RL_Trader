                                     PART I

     Item 1.   Business.
     ------    --------
                                   THE COMPANY

     GENERAL

          The Company is a financial services company principally engaged,
     through its subsidiaries, in personal and commercial lines of property
     and casualty insurance, life and health insurance primarily marketed
     directly to older individuals, banking and lending, incentive services
     and manufacturing.  The Company concentrates on profitability and
     maximizing cash flow in order to build long-term shareholder value,
     rather than emphasizing volume or market share.  Shareholders' equity
     has grown from a deficit of approximately $7,657,000 at December 31,
     1978 (prior to the acquisition of control of and significant ownership
     interest in the Company by both the Company's Chairman and President),
     to a positive shareholders' equity of approximately $907,856,000 at
     December 31, 1993, equal to a book value per common share of negative
     $.22 at December 31, 1978 and $32.54 at December 31, 1993,
     respectively.  Income before income taxes and the cumulative effects
     of accounting changes for 1993 was $176,868,000, the highest in the
     history of the Company.

          The Company's principal operations are its insurance businesses,
     where it is a specialty markets provider of property and casualty and
     life insurance products to niche markets.  The Company's principal
     personal lines insurance products are automobile insurance, homeowners
     insurance, graded benefit life insurance marketed primarily to the age
     50-and-over population and variable annuity products.  The Company's
     principal commercial lines are property and casualty products provided
     for multi-family residential real estate, retail establishments, and
     taxicabs in the New York metropolitan area.  For the year ended
     December 31, 1993, the Company's insurance segments contributed
     approximately 80% of total revenue and, at December 31, 1993,
     constituted approximately 81% of consolidated assets.  

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries have a diversified
     investment portfolio of securities, substantially all of which are
     issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by U.S. governmental
     agencies or are rated "investment grade" by Moody's Investors Service
     Inc. ("Moody's") and/or Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P"). 
     Investments in mortgage loans, real estate and non-investment grade
     securities represented in the aggregate less than 1% of the insurance
     subsidiaries' aggregate portfolio at December 31, 1993.

          The Company's banking and lending operations primarily consist of
     making instalment loans funded by customer banking deposits
     ("Deposits") insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the
     "FDIC").  The Company has established a niche market for automobile
     loans to individuals with poor credit histories.  Based on its
     experience with such loans, the Company concluded that excellent
     opportunities exist for a successful expansion of this business. 
     Accordingly, during 1993 the Company increased, on a controlled basis,
     its investment in such loans.  The Company intends to expand this
     business in 1994.  The Company's incentive services operations consist
     primarily of trading stamp operations.  The Company's manufacturing
     operations primarily manufacture products for the "do-it-yourself"
     home improvement market and for industrial and agricultural markets.

          At December 31, 1993, the Company had aggregate minimum tax loss
     carryforwards of approximately $197,000,000.  The amount and
     availability of tax loss carryforwards are subject to certain
     qualifications, limitations and uncertainties, including, with respect
     to its consolidated subsidiary, Phlcorp, Inc. ("Phlcorp"), tax sharing
     payments pursuant to a tax settlement agreement with the Internal
     Revenue Service and the Department of Justice.

          The Company also has investments, including non-controlling
     equity interests representing more than 5% of the outstanding capital
     stock of several public companies.  Additionally, the Company
     continuously
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     

     evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and
     investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to
     maximize its ultimate economic value to shareholders.

          As used herein, the term "Company" refers to Leucadia National
     Corporation, a New York corporation organized in 1968, and its
     subsidiaries, except as the context otherwise may require.

                              INSURANCE OPERATIONS

     GENERAL

          The Company engages in the personal property and casualty and the
     life and health insurance businesses on a nationwide basis and
     specializes in the commercial property and casualty insurance business
     in the New York metropolitan area.  The Company's principal insurance
     subsidiaries consist of the CP Group, Charter National Life Insurance
     Company ("Charter") and the Empire Group.  The CP Group consists of
     Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company ("CPL"), Colonial Penn Franklin
     Insurance Company ("Franklin"), Colonial Penn Heritage Insurance
     Company ("Heritage"), Colonial Penn Insurance Company ("CPI") and
     Intramerica Life Insurance Company ("Intramerica").  The Empire Group
     consists of Empire Insurance Company ("Empire"), Empire's subsidiary,
     Allcity Insurance Company ("Allcity") and Colonial Penn Madison
     Insurance Company ("Madison").  In conducting its insurance
     operations, the Company focuses primarily on profitability and
     persistency rather than volume.

          A.M. Best Company ("Best"), an independent rating agency, has
     rated CPL, Charter, and Empire "A" (excellent), Intramerica "A-"
     (excellent) and CPI, Franklin and Heritage "NA-5" (indicating a
     previously rated company which has experienced a significant change in
     ownership, management or book of business, as a result of which its
     operating experience may be interrupted).  Demotech, Inc., an
     independent rating agency, has rated CPI, Franklin and Heritage "A"
     (exceptional).  Ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time.

          Restructuring of CP Group

          The Company's insurance operations were significantly increased
     as a result of the Company's acquisition of CPG on August 16, 1991. 
     The Company acquired CPG for an aggregate cash purchase price of
     approximately $128,000,000, including costs.  For the year ended
     December 31, 1992 and for the period from August 16, 1991 to December
     31, 1991, CPG contributed approximately $131,757,000 and $59,995,000,
     respectively, to the Company's consolidated pre-tax income, including
     gains on sales of securities (approximately $23,543,000 and
     $16,323,000, respectively) and exclusive of financing costs.  Due to
     changes in the Company's insurance operations it is not practicable to
     provide meaningful comparable information for CPG for 1993.  At the
     acquisition date, after giving effect to a cash contribution by the
     seller prior to the closing of approximately $49,827,000, CPG had
     unaudited shareholder's equity, determined in accordance with
     generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), of approximately
     $391,000,000 (or approximately $263,000,000 in excess of the purchase
     price) and the CP Group had combined unaudited statutory capital and
     surplus for regulatory purposes determined in accordance with
     statutory accounting principles ("SAP") of approximately $225,100,000. 
     This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the consolidated
     financial statements included in this Report include the operations of
     CPG since August 16, 1991.

          Historically, the CP Group marketed most of its insurance
     products directly to individuals without the use of commissioned
     agents through "direct response marketing" methods.  Direct response
     marketing includes any form of marketing in which a company and a
     customer deal directly with each other rather than through an
     insurance agent.  Direct response marketing methods include print
     advertising, radio and television advertising, direct mail,
     telemarketing and customer referral programs.  Typical direct response
     marketing campaigns utilize a variety of these methods in a planned
     sequence.  The costs of certain of these marketing efforts were
     substantial and the Company believes were not justified by the CP
     Group's previous operating results.  As a result, during the Company's
     restructuring of the CP Group, the CP Group substantially refined and
     reduced its marketing efforts.  The Company believes that smaller and
     more focused direct response marketing campaigns have resulted in
     lower unit costs, resulting in more profitable operations, albeit with
     an initial substantial




                                       4<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     

     reduction in new business.  The Company believes that as a result of
     its restructuring efforts, which are complete, together with the
     Company's operating experience, the Colonial Penn P&C Group (as
     defined below) has become a low cost provider of automobile and
     homeowners insurance to its niche markets, enabling it to charge
     competitive rates, which should aid the Colonial Penn P&C Group in
     obtaining new business and retaining existing business.  Furthermore,
     as a result of the Colonial Penn life insurance companies' favorable
     experience in obtaining new business, the Company has increased its
     direct response marketing of graded benefit life products, generating
     significant new premiums at acceptable acquisition costs.

          The Company believes that its restructuring efforts described
     above have increased the CP Group's profitability without impairing
     service to existing policyholders.

     PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

          The Company's principal property and casualty insurance
     operations are conducted through CPI, Franklin and Heritage
     (collectively, the "Colonial Penn P&C Group") and through the Empire
     Group.  The Colonial Penn P&C Group, which maintains its headquarters
     in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, is licensed in all 50 states, the
     District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and
     writes insurance throughout most of the United States.  The Colonial
     Penn P&C Group has regional offices in Devon, Pennsylvania, Tampa,
     Florida and Phoenix, Arizona.  The Empire Group is licensed in twenty-
     three states and operates primarily in the New York metropolitan area.


          During the year ended December 31, 1993, approximately 80%, 13%
     and 7% of net earned premiums of the Company's property and casualty
     insurance operations were derived from personal and commercial
     automobile lines of insurance, commercial lines of insurance (other
     than automobile insurance) and personal lines of insurance (other than
     automobile insurance), respectively.  Total property and casualty
     insurance net earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 1993
     aggregated approximately $712,000,000, of which approximately
     $452,600,000 was attributable to the Colonial Penn P&C Group.

          Set forth below is certain statistical information for the
     Company's property and casualty operations for each of the three years
     in the period ended December 31, 1993 prepared in accordance with GAAP
     and SAP.  The Combined Ratio is the sum of the Loss Ratio and the
     Expense Ratio.  A Combined Ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting
     profit and a Combined Ratio above 100% indicates an underwriting loss. 
     The Loss Ratio is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses
     incurred to net premiums earned.  Incurred losses include a provision
     for claims which have occurred but have not yet been reported.  The
     Expense Ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses (policy
     acquisition costs, including commissions, and a portion of
     administrative, general and other expenses attributable to
     underwriting operations) to net premiums written, if determined in
     accordance with SAP, or to net premiums earned, if determined in
     accordance with GAAP.  Certain accident and health insurance business,
     which is included in the statutory results of operations of the
     property and casualty insurance segment and is reflected in the SAP
     Combined Ratio, is reported in the life insurance segment for
     financial reporting purposes and therefore is not included in the GAAP
     Combined Ratios reflected herein.  The Combined Ratio does not reflect
     the effect of investment income on the results of operations.

        (b)      Source:  Best's Insurance Management Reports, Property/Casualty, March 25, 1993.  A comparison to
                 industry combined ratios may not be meaningful as a result of, among other things, differences in
                 geographical concentration and in the mix of property and casualty insurance products.
        (c)      For 1993, the difference in the treatment of certain costs for GAAP and SAP purposes was a principle
                 reason for the difference between the GAAP Combined Ratio and the SAP Combined Ratio.  For 1992, the
                 results of the accident and health insurance business, which (as described above) are reflected in
                 the SAP Combined Ratio but are not reflected in the GAAP Combined Ratio, had a non-recurring income
                 item which reduced the SAP Combined Ratio.  In addition, in 1992 certain income credits were
                 recognized only for GAAP purposes.


</TABLE>

        The Company believes, based on published reports, that the Colonial
     Penn P&C Group's SAP Expense Ratio for 1992, the last year for which
     annual industry data is available, is among the lowest in the
     industry.

          The Colonial Penn P&C Group

          The Colonial Penn P&C Group's primary business is providing
     private passenger automobile and homeowners insurance coverage to the
     age 50-and-over population.  The Colonial Penn P&C Group's goal is to
     be one of the lowest cost providers to this market.

          Substantially all of the policies are written for a one-year
     period.  However, in many states CPI and Franklin offer a "guaranteed
     lifetime protection" provision in its automobile policies whereby,
     subject to certain exceptions, policyholders who are age 50 and older
     are guaranteed that CPI and Franklin will renew their policies at
     rates then in effect for the insured's appropriate classification.

      (1)   Does not include net earned premiums with respect to involuntary
            automobile insurance, i.e., mandatory assumed risks, which generally
            relate to the amount of writings in the applicable state.

            casualty operations, see "Insurance Operations-General-Government
            Regulation."
</TABLE>


          Prior to 1988, CPI wrote as primary insurer or as a reinsurer
     certain commercial property and casualty insurance business known as
     "Special Risks."  The Special Risks business consisted of a variety of
     diverse commercial lines including, among other things, general
     corporate liability policies issued to public and corporate entities,
     residual value insurance on leased automobiles, collision insurance to
     car leasing and rental businesses and professional and directors and
     officers liability insurance.  CPI had realized significant losses in
     the Special Risks business prior to the acquisition date and had
     provided for significant additional losses from time to time, both as
     to policy benefits and non-recoverable reinsurance receivables.  The
     nature of most of this insurance involves exposures which can be
     expected to develop over a relatively long period of time before a
     definitive determination of ultimate losses and loss adjustment
     expenses can be established.  As a result, losses with respect to this
     block are particularly difficult to predict accurately.  Based in part
     upon a recently completed independent actuarial review, the Company
     believes that the policy reserves for the Special Risks block
     reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1993
     (approximately $74,900,000, before reinsurance) are adequate.  In
     evaluating and administering the Special Risks portfolio, the Company
     has used its experience gained from the management of certain of the
     WMAC Companies (as defined below), which also involves managing the
     run-off of a closed block of commercial property and casualty
     insurance business.  The Company intends to manage the run-off of the
     Special Risks block and does not intend to offer this aspect of
     commercial lines insurance either as an insurer or reinsurer.  The
     WMAC Companies are certain legal subsidiaries of Phlcorp which are or
     have been under the control of the Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner
     due to the rehabilitation and liquidation proceedings (which were
     initiated prior to the Company's acquisition of Phlcorp) of certain of
     Phlcorp's non-consolidated subsidiaries (the "WMAC Companies").

          The Empire Group

          The Empire Group provides personal insurance coverage to
     automobile owners and homeowners and commercial insurance primarily
     for residential real estate, restaurants, retail establishments,
     taxicabs (both medallion and radio-controlled) and several types of
     service contractors.

          For the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, net earned
     premiums and commissions for the Empire Group aggregated approximately
     $259,400,000, $243,100,000 and $210,700,000, respectively. 
     Substantially all of the Empire Group policies are written in New York
     for a one-year period; however, some policies are issued for three
     years with provision for re-rating the policy for premium purposes at
     each policy anniversary date.  The Empire Group is licensed in New
     York to write all lines of insurance that may be written by a property
     and casualty insurer except residual value, credit, unemployment,
     animal and marine protection and indemnity insurance and ocean marine
     insurance.

          The Empire Group has acquired blocks of private passenger
     automobile and commercial automobile assigned risk business from
     insurance companies required or volunteering to terminate such
     coverage.  These contractual arrangements provide for fees to the
     Empire Group within parameters established by the New York Insurance
     Department.  In addition, the Empire Group acts for a fee as a
     "servicing carrier," providing administrative services, including
     claims processing, underwriting and collection activities, for the New
     York Public Automobile Pool.  This latter arrangement does not involve
     the assumption of any material underwriting risk by the Empire Group.

          As is true with the Company's other insurance subsidiaries, the
     Empire Group's marketing strategy emphasizes profitability rather than
     volume.  The business of the Empire Group is produced through general
     agents, local agents and insurance brokers, who are compensated for
     their services by payment of commissions on the premiums they
     generate.  There are five general agents, one of which is owned by
     Empire, and approximately 426 local agents and insurance brokers
     presently acting under agreements with the Empire Group.  These agents
     and brokers also represent other competing insurance companies.

          Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

          Liabilities for unpaid losses, which are not discounted (except
     for certain workers' compensation liabilities), and loss adjustment
     expenses ("LAE") are determined using case-basis evaluations,
     statistical analyses and estimates for salvage and subrogation
     recoverable and represent estimates of the ultimate claim costs of all
     unpaid losses and LAE through December 31 of each year.  These
     estimates are subject to the effect of trends in future claim severity
     and frequency experience.  Adjustments to such estimates are made from
     time to time to represent changes in loss experience (and are
     reflected in current earnings).

          In the following table, the liability for losses and LAE of the
     Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are reconciled
     for each of the three years ended December 31, 1993.  Included therein
     are current year data and prior year development.

          The Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries rely
     upon standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques to obtain
     estimates of liabilities for losses and LAE.  These projections
     include the extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by business
     line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation
     and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon
     historical patterns.  In addition, methods based upon average loss
     costs, reported claim counts and pure premiums are reviewed in order
     to obtain a consistent range of estimates for setting the reserve
     levels.  For further input, loss reserve committees periodically

     mix, claims management and legal climate.  Such input sometimes leads
     to modifications of the statistical projections.

          The Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries'
     liability for losses and LAE as of December 31, 1993 was $910,657,000
     determined in accordance with SAP and $1,051,868,000 determined in
     accordance with GAAP.  The reconciling differences principally relate
     to liabilities assumed by reinsurers, which are not deducted from GAAP
     liabilities (approximately $163,000,000) reduced by approximately
     $15,000,000, net, included in accounts other than property and
     casualty loss reserves for GAAP and approximately $6,000,000 for
     salvage and subrogation.

          The tables below present the development of balance sheet
     liabilities for 1983 through 1993 and include periods prior to
     acquisition for each of the Empire Group and the Colonial Penn P&C
     Group.  The adjusted liability line of the table indicates the
     estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance
     sheet date for each of the indicated years.  This liability represents
     the estimated amount of losses and LAE for claims that were unpaid at
     each annual balance sheet date, including provisions for losses
     estimated to have been incurred but not reported to the Company's
     property and casualty companies.  The middle section of the table
     shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability
     based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year.  The
     estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known
     about the frequency and severity of claims.  The lower section of the
     table shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously
     recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year.  Thus, for
     the year 1985, the Empire Group table indicates that an estimated
     $8,887,000 of losses remain unpaid as of December 31, 1993 (the
     difference between the currently estimated $155,727,000 of re-
     estimated liability for that year and the $146,840,000 paid through
     December 31, 1993).

          The effect on income during the past three years of changes in
     estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE is shown in the
     reconciliation table above.

          The "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" represents the aggregate
     change in the estimates over all prior years.  For example, the
     initial 1983 liability estimate indicated on the Empire Group table
     ($153,342,000) has been re-estimated during the course of the
     succeeding ten years, resulting in a re-estimated liability at
     December 31, 1993 of $131,556,000, or a redundancy of $21,786,000.  If
     the re-estimation of liability exceeded the liability initially
     established, a cumulative deficiency would be indicated.

          As noted in the Colonial Penn P&C Group table below, the loss and
     LAE development of the Colonial Penn P&C Group from 1985 through 1989
     resulted in cumulative deficiencies, indicating that the established
     reserves for policy claims and LAE were less than subsequently
     determined to be necessary.  The Colonial Penn P&C Group provided
     additional reserves related to prior years' claims of approximately
     $107,100,000 in 1990 and $35,100,000 in 1989.  Prior to its
     acquisition by the Company, and in part as a result of the unfavorable
     loss development, the Colonial Penn P&C Group reviewed its loss ratio
     and experience on a state-by-state basis, and initiated procedures to
     improve underwriting standards, increase rates (subject to necessary
     regulatory approvals) and withdraw from certain states with
     unfavorable experience, where permissible, on financially acceptable
     terms.  The Company used the knowledge and experience gained from
     managing Empire and certain of the WMAC Companies to review the
     adequacy of the Colonial Penn P&C Group reserves and concluded that
     the existing reserves were adequate.

          The Company believes that the Empire Group's conservatism in
     establishing reserves and CP Group's conservatism and improved claims
     management procedures since acquisition have contributed significantly
     to the creation of the redundancies included in the tables below.

          In evaluating this information, it should be noted that each
     amount shown for "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" includes the
     effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods.  For example, the
     amount of the redundancy (deficiency) related to losses settled in
     1987, but incurred in 1983, will be included in the cumulative
     redundancy (deficiency) amount for 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986.  This
     table is not intended to and does not present accident or policy year
     loss and LAE development data.  Conditions and trends that have
     affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily
     occur in the future.  Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to
     extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on these tables.

          Because of substantial differences in the development of reserves
     of the Colonial Penn P&C Group and the Empire Group, loss and LAE
     development data of the Colonial Penn P&C Group and the Empire Group
     are each presented separately.

     LIFE INSURANCE

          The Company's principal life insurance subsidiaries are Charter,
     CPL and Intramerica.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, the
     Company's principal life insurance products were "Graded Benefit Life"
     and variable annuity insurance products.  Through its various
     subsidiaries, the Company is licensed in all 50 states, the District
     of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands and
     generally writes its life and health products in most of the United
     States.  Total direct life insurance in force as of December 31, 1993
     was approximately $2.7 billion.

          The following table reflects premiums earned on the Company's
     life and health insurance products (except investment oriented
     products) and premium receipts on variable annuity and other
     investment oriented products for each of the three years in the period
     ended December 31, 1993.  Variable annuity and other investment
     oriented product premium receipts are not recorded as revenue under
     GAAP but are recorded in a manner similar to a deposit, and are
     included below.

          Life and Health Insurance Products

          Graded Benefit Life.  "Graded Benefit Life" is a guaranteed-issue
     product.  These modified-benefit, whole life policies are offered on
     an individual basis primarily to persons age 50 to 80, principally in
     face amounts of $350 to $10,000, without medical examination or
     evidence of insurability.  Premiums are paid as frequently as monthly. 
     Graded Benefit Life is marketed using direct response marketing
     techniques.  New policyholder leads are generated primarily from
     television advertisements.  Consistent with its present marketing
     program, the Company intends to concentrate its marketing efforts
     towards soliciting new policyholders where the cost is justified,
     upgrading existing policyholders' policy packages and obtaining
     referrals from existing policyholders.  The Company believes that
     premiums on new business written in 1994 will exceed reductions due to
     death and lapses.

          During late l993, the Company began offering certain
     policyholders a rider to their existing Graded Benefit Life policy. 
     This "Accelerated Benefit Rider" pays a policy benefit if the
     policyholder is suffering from a terminal illness.  Initial results
     are promising and the Company expects to offer this rider to
     additional policyholders on a limited basis.  The Company is exploring
     the development of other new products.

          Investment Oriented Products.  During 1993, the principal
     investment oriented product offered by the Company's life insurance
     subsidiaries was a no-load variable annuity ("VA") product.  The VA
     product is marketed as an investment vehicle to individuals seeking to
     defer, for federal income tax purposes, the annual increase in their
     account balance.  Premiums from this VA product either are invested at
     the policyholders' election in unaffiliated mutual funds where the
     policyholder bears the entire investment risk or in a fixed account
     where the funds earn interest at rates determined by the Company.  The
     Company's VA product is currently marketed in conjunction with a
     mutual fund manager.  The Company is pursuing cooperative arrangements
     with other money managers to distribute its VA product.

          Prior to 1991, the investment oriented products sold by the
     Company included, among others, single premium deferred annuity
     ("SPDA") and single premium whole life ("SPWL") products.  During
     1992, the Company concluded that the profitability of its existing
     blocks of SPDA and SPWL businesses were unlikely to achieve acceptable
     operating results in the future.  For a discussion of the reinsurance
     of certain of these products, see "Management's Discussion and
     Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

          Medicare Supplement.  Medicare Supplement products are health
     insurance products primarily designed to supplement medicare benefits
     for the older population on an underwritten guaranteed renewable
     basis.  Prior to l993, the Company's Medicare Supplement products were
     marketed primarily through insurance agents.  As a result of recent
     federal and state legislation mandating standardization of Medicare
     Supplement products (thereby enhancing an individual's ability to
     compare various Medicare Supplement products), this market has become
     more competitive.  The Company is no longer actively marketing
     Medicare Supplement products, but is offering renewals of its non-
     standardized products to its policyholders.  National health care
     reforms are currently under consideration.  It is not possible to
     predict whether any reforms will be enacted, and, if enacted, what
     effect such reforms might have on the Company's Medicare Supplement
     products.

     INSURANCE OPERATIONS - GENERAL

          Investments

          Investment activities represent a significant part of the
     Company's insurance related revenues and profitability.  Investments
     are managed by the Company's investment advisors under the direction
     of, and upon consultation with, the Company's several investment
     committees.

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries have a diversified
     investment portfolio of securities substantially all of which are
     rated "investment grade" by Moody's and/or S&P or issued or guaranteed
     by the U.S. Treasury or by governmental agencies.  The Company's
     insurance subsidiaries do not generally invest in less than
     "investment grade" or "non-rated" securities, real estate or
     mortgages, although the Company's insurance subsidiaries may from time
     to time make such investments in amounts not expected to be material. 
     For additional information concerning the Company's investments, see
     "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."

          Reinsurance

          The Company currently obtains reinsurance for certain of its life
     insurance policies and property and casualty insurance policies. 
     Among the Company's major reinsurers (and their respective Best
     ratings) are General Reinsurance Corporation (A++), Lincoln National
     Life Insurance Co. (A+), Munich American Reinsurance Company (A++) and
     Hartford Fire Insurance Company (A+).  Reinsurance is obtained for
     investment oriented products for face amounts in excess of $500,000
     per life.  The life insurance subsidiaries generally do not obtain
     reinsurance for the Graded Benefit Life products because these
     policies generally do not exceed $10,000 face amount.  The Colonial
     Penn P&C Group obtained reinsurance for casualty risks in excess of
     $2,000,000 in 1993 ($1,000,000 in 1992).  Most Colonial Penn P&C Group
     automobile policies do not have policy limits in excess of $100,000
     per risk and $300,000 per accident.  The Empire Group's maximum limit
     retained for workers' compensation was $500,000 from July 1, 1992
     through December 31, 1993 and $200,000 from January 1, 1991 through
     June 30, 1992 and for other property and casualty lines, the maximum
     limit retained was $225,000 for 1993 and $175,000 for each of 1992 and
     1991.  Additionally, the Company's property and casualty insurance
     subsidiaries have entered into certain excess of loss and catastrophe
     treaties to protect against certain losses.  See "Management's
     Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
     Operations."  Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an
     insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policy
     liability, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer
     to the extent of the reinsurance ceded.   The Company's reinsurance
     generally has been placed with certain of the largest reinsurance
     companies, which the Company believes to be financially capable of
     meeting their respective obligations.  However, to the extent that any
     reinsuring company is unable to meet its obligations, the Company's
     insurance subsidiaries would be liable for the reinsured risks. 
     Additionally, certain of CPI's Special Risks reinsurers have
     experienced financial difficulty and some are in rehabilitation
     proceedings.  CPI has

                                       16<PAGE>
<PAGE>

     established reserves, which the Company believes are adequate, for
     nonrecoverable reinsurance on its Special Risks block of insurance.

          In 1992, 1993 and 1994, unusually severe natural disasters
     occurred, including Hurricane Andrew (1992), the Midwest floods and
     California fires (1993) and the Los Angeles Earthquake (1994).  These
     events have resulted in unprecedented industry-wide losses.  The
     Company's insurance subsidiaries also suffered losses as a result of
     certain of these occurrences, although reinsurance reduced the
     economic loss to the Company of Hurricane Andrew.  However, as a
     result of the industry's losses, the Company has seen a notable
     decrease in the availability of catastrophe reinsurance at reasonable
     rates, particularly at low levels of deductibility.  Although the
     Company has completed its 1994 reinsurance program at acceptable upper
     loss limits, the insurance subsidiaries in 1993 and 1994 were unable
     to obtain 1992 levels of deductibility at reasonable cost. 
     Accordingly, the Company increased its retention of lower level
     losses.  The Company did not incur catastrophic losses in excess of
     its retained limits in 1993 and to date in 1994.  Further, in 1992 the
     Company did not incur losses in excess of its maximum reinsurance.

          Competition

          The insurance industry is a highly competitive industry, in which
     many of the Company's competitors have substantially greater financial
     resources, larger sales forces, more widespread agency and broker
     relationships, and more diversified lines of insurance coverage. 
     Additionally, certain competitors market their products with
     endorsements from affinity groups, while the Company's products are
     for the most part unendorsed, which may give such other companies a
     competitive advantage.  

          VA products are subject to regulation both as insurance policies
     and as securities.  As a result, the introduction of a VA product
     involves significant regulatory and administrative efforts over a
     substantial period of time.  The Company expects sales of its no-load
     VA product to be cyclical, generally following the securities markets. 
     The attractiveness of VA products as an investment vehicle is closely
     linked to the tax status of such products.  Typically, increases in
     account values of VA products are not taxed until distributed in the
     form of either surrenders or annuity payments.  The taxable portion of
     any such distribution is taxed as ordinary income.

          The property and casualty insurance industry has historically
     been cyclical in nature, with periods of less intense price competi-
     tion and high underwriting standards generating significant profits,
     followed by periods of increased price competition and lower under-
     writing standards resulting in reduced profitability or loss.  Price
     competition has been significant in recent years.  The cyclicality and
     competitive nature of the property and casualty insurance business
     historically have contributed to significant industry-wide quarter-to-
     quarter and year-to-year fluctuations in underwriting results and net
     income.  Its profitability is affected by many factors, including rate
     competition, severity and frequency of claims, interest rates, state
     regulation, court decisions and judicial climate, all of which are
     outside the Company's control.

          Government Regulation

          Insurance companies are subject to detailed regulation and
     supervision in the states in which they transact business.  Such
     regulation pertains to matters such as approving policy forms and
     various premium rates, minimum reserves and loss ratio requirements,
     the type and amount of investments, minimum capital and surplus
     requirements, granting and revoking licenses to transact business,
     levels of operations and regulating trade practices.  There can be no
     assurance that such regulatory requirements will not become more
     stringent in the future and have an adverse effect on the Company's
     operations.  The majority of the Company's property






                                       17<PAGE>
<PAGE>

     and casualty insurance operations are in states requiring prior
     approval by regulators before proposed rates may be implemented. 
     Certain states have indicated that they may change the bases (e.g.,
     age, sex and geographic location) on which rates traditionally have
     been established.  Rates proposed for life insurance generally become
     effective immediately upon filing.  Insurance companies are required
     to file detailed annual reports with the supervisory agencies in each
     of the states in which they do business, and are subject to
     examination by such agencies at any time.  Due to the savings and loan
     crisis and the seizure by state insurance regulators of certain large
     financially unstable insurance companies, there has been some erosion
     of confidence in all financial institutions, including insurance
     companies.  Increased regulation of insurance companies at the state
     level and new regulation at the federal level is possible, although
     the Company cannot predict the nature or extent of any such
     regulation.

          The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has
     adopted model laws incorporating the concept of a "risk based capital"
     requirement for insurance companies, although the model law is not
     intended to apply to property and casualty insurance companies until
     year end 1994 financial statements are available.  Generally, Risk
     Based Capital ("RBC") is designed to measure the adequacy of an
     insurer's statutory capital in relation to the risks inherent in its
     business.  The RBC formula is used by the states as an early warning
     tool to identify weakly capitalized companies for the purpose of
     initiating regulatory action.

          The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of
     statutory surplus for insurers by applying certain factors to various
     asset, premium and reserve items.  Higher factors are applied to more
     risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items.  Thus,
     the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of
     the insurer's size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer's
     operation.

          The RBC model laws provide for four incremental levels of
     regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the
     calculated RBC target.  These levels of attention range in severity
     from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to
     actually placing the insurer under regulatory control.  

          Each of the Company's insurance subsidiaries' RBC ratio as of
     December 31, 1993 substantially exceeded the minimum requirements.

          The NAIC also has adopted various ratios for insurance companies
     which, in addition to the RBC ratio, are designed to serve as a tool
     to assist state regulators in discovering potential weakly capitalized
     companies.  Generally, life insurance companies having three or more
     of such ratios outside their "normal" range may be indicative of a
     weakly capitalized company.  Two of the Company's life insurance
     subsidiaries, Charter and CPL, had three or more "other than normal"
     NAIC ratios for the year ended December 31, 1993.  Charter had five
     "other than normal" ratios in l993, four of which resulted from
     reinsurance of the SPWL block of business described under
     "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
     Results of Operations," while CPL had four "other than normal" ratios
     in l993, three of which resulted from reinsurance transactions,
     including a transaction with an affiliate.  The Company believes that
     there are no underlying problems or weaknesses at Charter or CPL and
     that, in view of the strong capital and RBC ratios of Charter and CPL
     and their strong and conservative investment portfolios, it is
     unlikely that material adverse regulatory action will be taken.

          On November 8, 1988, California voters passed Proposition 103, an
     insurance initiative which requires a 20% rollback in insurance rates
     for policies written or renewed during the twelve month period
     beginning November 8, 1988 (the "rollback period") and provided that
     changes in insurance premiums after November 8, 1989 must be submitted
     for approval by the California Insurance Commissioner prior to
     implementation.  While the Proposition has the most significant impact
     on automobile insurance, some of its provisions also apply to





                                       18<PAGE>
<PAGE>
    

     other types of property and casualty insurance.  In May 1989, the
     California Supreme Court held that insurance companies may not be
     deprived of a "fair return."  In June 1991, the current California
     Insurance Commissioner issued revised regulations regarding the
     rollback period which established an allowable after-tax return of 10%
     for the rollback period.  These regulations were held unconstitutional
     by the Los Angeles Superior Court in February 1993, because each
     insurer was entitled to an individual hearing to determine its fair
     level of profit.  The California Insurance Commissioner has appealed
     this decision, which remains sub judice.  The Company has not yet
                                  ----------
     received any order or determination requiring it to refund any
     premiums collected.  Based upon its operating results in the relevant
     years, the Company believes the Colonial Penn P&C Group should not be
     assessed for any rollback rebate and, if assessed a significant
     amount, intends to vigorously oppose such determination.  Voluntary
     automobile net earned premiums in California represent approximately
     8.9% of the Company's total property and casualty net earned premiums. 
     Proposition 103 does not apply to premiums earned on involuntary
     coverage.  It is possible that other states may attempt similar
     initiatives, although the Company is unable to predict whether and to
     what extent such regulation may be proposed or adopted. 

          In early 1990, New Jersey adopted new laws to depopulate the
     deficit-ridden Automobile Joint Underwriting Association (the "JUA"),
     the New Jersey insurance pool for high-risk drivers.  The New Jersey
     statute, among other things, abolished the JUA, established the Market
     Transition Facility (the "MTF") as a temporary successor to the JUA,
     established quotas for depopulation of the MTF and required all
     automobile insurers to share in the losses of the MTF based on their
     depopulation share of the JUA, as set by the New Jersey Department of
     Insurance.  The MTF deficit is currently estimated to be $917 million. 
     Based on that amount, the Colonial Penn P&C Group would be assessed
     approximately $11,100,000.  In February 1994, the Colonial Penn P&C
     Group paid approximately $5,300,000 of this possible assessment into a
     court mandated escrow account.  The balance of this possible
     assessment has been provided for in the Company's December 31, 1993
     balance sheet.  The New Jersey Insurance Department has adopted
     regulations which would permit an insurer, with the approval of the
     Insurance Department, to recover amounts paid to the MTF through
     surcharges to policyholders; however, there can be no assurance that
     the Colonial Penn P&C Group would be permitted to surcharge its
     policyholders for all or even part of any assessment.  

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries are members of state
     insurance funds which provide certain protection to policyholders of
     insolvent insurers doing business in those states.  Due to
     insolvencies of certain insurers in recent years, the Company's
     insurance subsidiaries have been assessed certain amounts which have
     not been material and are likely to be assessed additional amounts by
     state insurance funds.  The Company believes that it has provided for
     all anticipated assessments and that any additional assessments will
     not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
     condition or results of operations.


                               BANKING AND LENDING

     GENERAL

          The Company's banking and lending operations primarily are
     conducted through its national bank subsidiary, American Investment
     Bank, N.A. ("AIB"); two wholly owned industrial loan corporations (the
     "ILCs"), American Investment Financial ("AIF") and Governor Financial
     ("GF"); and Transportation Capital Corp. ("TCC"), a small business
     investment company, which is a 99% owned subsidiary of the Company. 
     AIB and the ILCs take money market and other non-demand deposits that
     are eligible for insurance provided by the FDIC within its applicable
     limitations.  At December 31, 1993, AIB and the ILCs had Deposits of
     $173,365,000 compared to $186,339,000 at December 31, 1992.  In
     January 1994, the deposits and certain





                                       19<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     

     assets of GF were combined into AIF.  AIB and AIF currently have
     several deposit-taking and lending facilities and an administrative
     office in the Salt Lake City area.  TCC, which is not a significant
     subsidiary of the Company, makes collaterialized loans to operators of
     medallion taxicabs and limousines.

          At December 31, 1993, the Company's consolidated banking and
     lending operations had outstanding loans (net of unearned finance
     charges) of $205,744,000 compared to $169,552,000 at December 31,
     1992.  The increase was financed primarily from proceeds of the sale
     of the Company's consumer loan offices sold in 1992.  See
     "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and
     Results of Operations."  At December 31, 1993, approximately 36% were
     loans to individuals generally collateralized by automobiles;
     approximately 26% were unsecured loans to individuals acquired from
     others in connection with investments in limited partnerships;
     approximately 23% were unsecured loans to executives and
     professionals; approximately 9% were loans to small business concerns
     collateralized principally by taxicab medallions and other personal
     property; approximately 5% of the loans were instalment loans to
     consumers, substantially all of which were collateralized by real or
     personal property; and approximately 1% were loans generally
     collateralized by non-residential real estate.

          It is the Company's policy to charge to income an allowance for
     losses which, based upon management's analysis of numerous factors,
     including current economic trends, aging of the loan portfolio and
     historical loss experience, is deemed adequate to cover reasonably
     expected losses on outstanding loans.  At December 31, 1993, the
     allowance for loan losses for the Company's entire loan portfolio was
     approximately $8,341,000 or 4.1% of the net outstanding loans,
     compared to approximately $6,973,000 or 4.1% of net outstanding loans
     at December 31, 1992.

          The funds generated by the Deposits are primarily used to make
     instalment loans, including collateralized personal automobile loans
     to individuals who have difficulty in obtaining credit.  These
     automobile loans are made at interest rates above those charged to
     individuals with good credit histories.  In determining which
     individuals qualify for these loans, the Company takes into account a
     number of highly selective criteria with respect to the individual as
     well as the collateral to attempt to minimize the number of defaults. 
     Additionally, the Company monitors these loans and takes prompt
     possession of the collateral securing such loans in the event of a
     default.  For the three year period ended December 31, 1993, the
     Company generated an aggregate of approximately $100,754,000 of these
     loans (approximately $51,000,000 during 1993).  At December 31, 1993,
     the allowance for loan losses for this portfolio was approximately
     $4,399,000 or 6% of net outstanding loans; actual loss experience has
     been approximately 1.4% per year of average outstanding loans.  The
     Company is satisfied with the results of this loan portfolio and
     believes that there is an opportunity for successful growth in this
     niche market.  The Company intends to expand its business in this
     area.

     COMPETITION

          The Company's lending operations compete with banks, savings and
     loan associations and credit unions, many of which are able to offer
     financial services on very competitive terms, credit card issuers and
     consumer finance companies.  Additionally, substantial national
     financial services networks have been formed by major brokerage firms,
     insurance companies, retailers and bank holding companies.  Some
     competitors have substantial local market positions; others are part
     of large, diversified organizations.  

     GOVERNMENT REGULATION

          The Company's principal lending operations are subject to
     detailed supervision by state authorities, as well as federal
     regulation pursuant to the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and
     regulations promulgated




                                       20<PAGE>
<PAGE>
  

     by the Federal Trade Commission.  The Company's banking operations are
     subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision by,
     among others, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the
     "OCC"), the FDIC and the State of Utah.  AIB's primary federal
     regulator is the OCC, while the primary federal regulator for the ILCs
     is the FDIC.  AIB and AIF have substantially similar assets.  With
     FDIC approval on January 31, 1994, AIF purchased a substantial portion
     of the assets and assumed all of the deposit liabilities as well as a
     significant amount of the remaining liabilities of GF.  Following this
     transaction, GF retained its ILC charter but terminated its FDIC
     insurance and thus its right under Utah law to accept deposits.

          The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 ("CEBA") places
     certain restrictions on the operations and growth of AIB and restricts
     further acquisitions of banks and savings institutions by the Company. 
     CEBA does not restrict the growth of the ILCs as currently operated.  


                               INCENTIVE SERVICES

     GENERAL

          For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company's incentive
     services business was conducted by The Sperry and Hutchinson Company,
     Inc. ("S&H").  In early 1993, the Company contributed the net assets
     of S&H Motivation, Inc. ("SHM") to a new joint venture formed with an
     unrelated motivation services company and provided a $3,000,000 line
     of credit to the joint venture in exchange for a 45% equity interest
     in the joint venture.  Operations of the motivation services business
     historically have not been significant and are not expected to be
     significant in the future.

          S&H distributes Green Stamps to retailers under license
     agreements that give the retailer an exclusive franchise for a
     particular category of retail establishment in a particular geographic
     area.  Customers of participating retailers receive Green Stamps when
     they purchase goods and services.

          Since 1969, when annual sales for the trading stamp industry as a
     whole peaked, S&H's trading stamp business has been steadily
     declining.  The Company believes that there is a substantial
     likelihood that the declining trend in trading stamp sales will
     continue.  The Company has attempted, but has not succeeded in,
     developing new uses for its trading stamp business.

     REDEMPTION RESERVE-LIQUIDITY

          When trading stamps are sold, S&H receives cash and accrues as a
     liability the estimated obligation to deliver merchandise and/or cash
     associated with those stamps.  Demands for redemption generally occur
     over a considerable period of time.  The loss of customers usually
     results in an acceleration of redemptions and requires the expenditure
     of available funds to provide the merchandise and/or cash required for
     such redemptions.

          At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the liability for unredeemed
     trading stamps reflected in the Company's consolidated balance sheets
     was approximately $58,541,000 and $74,964,000, respectively.  The most
     recent statistical studies of trading stamp redemptions have indicated
     that the historical pattern of redemptions has changed and that the
     recorded liability for unredeemed trading stamps is in excess of the
     amount that ultimately will be required to redeem trading stamps
     outstanding.  The amount of this excess may be different than
     indicated by these studies.  Accordingly,  the Company is amortizing
     the apparent excess over









                                       21
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     a five year period.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
     Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

     COMPETITION

          The Company's incentive services businesses compete primarily
     with other incentive companies and other forms of promotional and
     merchandising techniques other than trading stamps.  Retail establish-
     ments, for example, frequently utilize store coupons, special
     advertising programs, games, extra services and related programs.

                                  MANUFACTURING

          The Company's manufacturing operations consist primarily of the
     manufacture of bathroom vanities and related products for the "do-it-
     yourself" market, through its General Marble division, and padding,
     absorbent, erosion control and proprietary plastic netting products
     for various industrial and agricultural uses, through its Fibers and
     Plastics divisions.  

          In 1990, the Company acquired a factory in North Carolina and in
     1991 equipped it with state-of-the-art manufacturing machinery for its
     General Marble division.  This facility was designed to enable the
     Company to improve the quality of its products, to manufacture certain
     of its products on a "ready-to-assemble" basis and to expand capacity. 
     General Marble's products are sold through manufacturers'
     representatives primarily to home improvement centers.  The
     inefficiencies and start up costs associated with bringing this
     facility to full production, together with pricing pressures, have
     adversely affected results of operations for this segment.

          The Fibers and Plastics divisions manufacture and market padding,
     absorbent and erosion control products, which may be reinforced with
     plastic netting, for the furniture, automotive, erosion control and
     maintenance industries and thermoplastic netting used for a variety of
     purposes including, among other things, construction, packaging,
     agriculture, carpet backing and filtration.

          The manufacturing operations are subject to a high degree of
     competition, generally on the basis of price, service and quality. 
     Additionally, these manufacturing operations are dependent on cyclical
     industries, including the construction industry, which have been
     adversely effected by recent economic conditions.  Through its various
     manufacturing divisions, the Company holds patents on certain
     improvements to the basic manufacturing processes and on applications
     thereof.  The Company believes that the expiration of these patents,
     individually or in the aggregate, is unlikely to have a material
     effect on the business of its manufacturing operations.


                        OTHER OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS

          The Company also owns non-controlling equity interests
     representing, at December 31, 1993, more than 5% of the outstanding
     capital stock of each of the following domestic public companies: 
     Carmike Cinemas, Inc. ("Carmike") (approximately 9% of Class A
     shares), Jones Plumbing Systems, Inc. ("Jones") (approximately 21%),
     Jordan Industries, Inc. ("JII") (approximately 11%) and Olympus
     Capital Corporation (approximately 18%).

          The Company owns interests in two foreign power companies: 
     Compania Boliviana de Energia Electrica, S.A. - Bolivian Power Company
     Limited ("Bolivian Power") and through Canadian International Power
     Company Limited Liquidating Trust, The Barbados Light and Power
     Company Limited.  The Company's investments in the power companies
     were recorded at an aggregate of approximately $5,208,000 at December
     31, 1993.  The shares of Bolivian Power are traded on the New York
     Stock Exchange.  In November 1993, the Company sold 750,000 common
     shares of Bolivian Power in an underwritten public offering.  The
     Company currently owns approximately 719,206 common shares of Bolivian
     Power, representing approximately 17% of Bolivian Power's outstanding
     common shares.

          In 1990, the Company received the stock of certain of the WMAC
     Companies that had been under the control of the Wisconsin Insurance
     Commissioner.  The Company is unable to predict when Commercial Loan
     Insurance Company ("CLIC") and WMAC Credit Insurance Corporation
     ("Credit"), two WMAC Companies which constitute substantially all of
     the WMAC Companies' remaining value expected from the assets under the
     control of the Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner, will be returned to
     its control.  The Company estimates that the fair value to the Company
     of the net tangible assets yet to be received is approximately
     $32,800,000 in excess of their recorded carrying value at December 31,
     1993.

          A subsidiary of the Company is a partner in The Jordan Company
     and Jordan/Zalaznick Capital Company.  These partnerships each
     specialize in structuring leveraged buyouts in which the partners are
     given the opportunity to become equity participants.  John W. Jordan
     II, a director of the Company, is the managing partner of the two
     partnerships.  Since 1982, the Company has invested an aggregate of
     $25,870,000 in these partnerships and related companies and, through
     December 31, 1993, has received approximately $62,398,000 (consisting
     of cash, interest bearing notes and other receivables) relating to the
     disposition of investments and management and other fees.  At December
     31, 1993, through these partnerships, the Company had interests in an
     aggregate of 15 companies (the "Jordan Associated Companies"), which
     are carried in the Company's consolidated financial statements at
     $13,620,000.  The Jordan Associated Companies include JII, Carmike and
     Jones.

     Item 2.   Properties.
     ------    ----------
          Through its various subsidiaries, the Company owns the following
     significant properties:  an office building in Clayton, Missouri
     (approximately 66,000 sq. ft.), which is leased to unaffiliated
     parties; an office building in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania (approxi-
     mately 94,800 sq. ft.) located on land leased from a third party to a
     subsidiary of the Company; two offices in Salt Lake City, Utah
     (totaling approximately 74,000 sq. ft.); three multi-tenant office
     buildings in Indianapolis, Indiana (totaling approximately 444,000 sq.
     ft.) which are leased (or are available for lease) to unaffiliated
     parties; and a warehouse in Fort Worth, Texas (approximately 256,000
     sq. ft.) that is leased to a third party.  In addition, subsidiaries
     of the Company own nine facilities (totaling approximately 1,208,000
     sq. ft.) primarily used for manufacturing and storage located in
     Georgia, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin
     and Canada.

          The Company's subsidiaries lease numerous manufacturing,
     warehousing, office and headquarters facilities.  The facilities vary
     in size and have leases expiring at various times, subject in certain
     instances to renewal options.  See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
     Financial Statements.

     Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.  
     ------    -----------------
     PHLCORP TENDER OFFER

          Seven class action complaints were filed against the Company and
     others in connection with the Company's tender offer to purchase up to
     5,200,000 common shares of Phlcorp, which expired in February 1988,
     and have been consolidated into one action in the United States
     District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Southern
     District"), entitled In re PHLCORP Securities Tender Offer Litigation
                          ------------------------------------------------
     (Civil Action No. 88 Civ. 0306 (SS)) ("In Re Phlcorp").
                                            -------------
          The consolidated and amended class action complaint (the
     "Complaint") seeks damages (in an unspecified amount), imposition of a
     constructive trust and costs and disbursements of the action.

          Several of the claims were dismissed in 1988 as a result of
     defendants' motion to dismiss.  The remaining claims allege that
     defendants violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
     by causing Phlcorp's directors to issue a recommendation to accept the
     Company's tender offer, which incorrectly represented that the
     directors' recommendation was based on a determination that the
     Company's offer was fair and that defendants breached their fiduciary
     duties in connection with the tender offer.  A class of plaintiff
     minority shareholders, who owned shares of Phlcorp on January 21,
     1988, has been certified.  

          Upon completion of discovery, with the exception of discovery of
     experts, defendants filed a motion for Summary Judgment.  Prior to the
     time defendants' reply brief was due, the parties reached an agreement
     in principle for the settlement of the action.  A stipulation of
     settlement was submitted to the Court for its approval on January 24,
     1994.  At a conference on February 2, 1994, the Court entered an order
     requiring (a) plaintiffs to mail notice of the proposed settlement to
     class members by February 22, 1994, (b) class members to submit any
     objections to the settlement by April 15, 1994 and (c) a hearing to
     determine whether the settlement should be approved to be held on
     April 29, 1994.  Because of the settlement agreement, defendants
     withdrew their summary judgment motion, without prejudice to renew the
     motion in the event that the court does not approve the settlement.

          Defendants believe that the material allegations of these
     complaints are without merit and, if not settled, intend to defend
     these actions vigorously.

     EMPIRE TRANSACTIONS

          Beginning in 1988, four separate actions were commenced in the
     Supreme Court, New York County relating to Empire's conversion from a
     mutual to a stock company, a 1988 reverse stock split, a subsequent
     odd lot cash tender offer and adoption of Empire's Section 7118 Plan
     in l991.  Empire, Phlcorp and ten of Empire's directors are named as
     defendants in some or all of these actions.

          While the Company believes the material allegations of these
     actions are without merit, these actions have been settled pursuant to
     Court approval.  The settlement, which will become final during the
     second quarter of l994, unless appealed, will have no material effect
     on the Company.

     PHLCORP MERGER

          Three actions were filed by minority shareholders of Phlcorp in
     connection with the August 17, 1992 proposal by the Company to Phlcorp
     that the Company acquire all outstanding Phlcorp shares not already
     owned







                                       24
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     by it and its subsidiaries and the October 12, 1992 public
     announcement that the Company and Phlcorp had reached an agreement in
     principle with respect to the merger of Phlcorp (then a 63.1% owned
     public subsidiary of the Company) with and into a wholly owned
     subsidiary of the Company (the "Phlcorp Merger").  The actions name
     the Company and/or Phlcorp and their directors as defendants.  Two of
     the actions were brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New
     York, County of New York, and one was filed in the Pennsylvania Court
     of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County.  The Pennsylvania action has
     been voluntarily discontinued.

          The amended class action complaints in the New York action
     contain similar allegations, inter alia, that the Company, aided and
     abetted by its directors, breached its fiduciary duties purportedly
     owed to Phlcorp's minority shareholders by using its position as
     controlling shareholder of Phlcorp to effect the Merger on terms which
     do not reflect the true value of Phlcorp Shares, by failing to
     disclose material facts concerning Phlcorp's assets, businesses, and
     future prospects, and by timing the October 12 Proposal to coincide
     with an abnormally high stock price of Leucadia and an artificially
     depressed Phlcorp stock price.  In addition, one of the New York
     actions asserts a derivative claim brought on behalf of Phlcorp for
     corporate waste under state law.

          In November and December 1992, defendants moved to dismiss the
     New York actions.  In early December 1992, plaintiffs' request for a
     preliminary injunction barring consummation of the Phlcorp Merger, was
     denied.

          The parties have entered into settlement negotiations.  On
     February 19, 1993, the court denied defendants' motions to dismiss the
     New York actions as moot in light of settlement negotiations.  The
     court indicated that plaintiffs would be able to re-open the cases by
     way of an order to show cause if the cases are not in fact settled. 
     On September 5, 1993, the parties entered into a memorandum of
     understanding to settle the matter subject to plaintiffs conducting
     confirmatory discovery and the court's approval of the settlement.

          Defendants believe that the material allegations of these
     complaints are without merit and, if not settled, intend to defend
     these actions vigorously.

     OTHER PROCEEDINGS

          In addition to the foregoing, the Company and its subsidiaries
     are parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either
     ordinary, routine litigation incidental to their business or not
     material to the Company's consolidated financial position.

          The Company does not believe that any of the foregoing actions
     will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
     position or consolidated results of operations.

     distributions on, or the purchase, redemption or other acquisition of

     Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
               -----------------------------------------------------------
     and Results of Operations.
     -------------------------

     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          The Company.  During each of the three years in the period ended
          -----------
     December 31, 1993, the Company operated profitably and in the year
     ended December 31, 1991 net cash was provided from operations.  For
     the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, in spite of increased
     earnings, net cash was used for operations.  The 1992 net cash used
     principally resulted from a 1991 reinsurance transaction, which had
     the effect of reducing CPI's premium to surplus ratio for 1991, and
     the 1993 net cash used principally related to the transfer of blocks
     of insurance described below.

          Principally as a result of the acquisition of the minority
     interest in Phlcorp (the "Phlcorp Minority Interest") on December 31,
     1992 and the Company's continuing profitable operations, ratings of
     the Company's debt obligations were upgraded in 1993 by Moody's, S&P
     and Duff & Phelps Inc., three of the leading bond rating agencies, all
     of which rated the Company's senior debt as "investment grade."  The
     Company believes the higher ratings have made it substantially easier
     to raise additional funds, including the offerings described below, on
     favorable terms.  Ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject
     to change at any time.

          In February 1993, the Company sold $100,000,000 principal amount
     of its newly authorized 5 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due
     2003 (the "Convertible Debentures") in an underwritten public
     offering.  The Convertible Debentures are convertible into Common
     Shares at $57.50 per Common Share (an aggregate of 1,739,130 Common
     Shares), subject to anti-dilution provisions.  In August 1993, the
     Company sold $100,000,000 principal amount of its newly authorized 7
     3/4% Senior Notes due 2013 (at 99% of principal amount) in an
     underwritten public offering.  The net proceeds of these offerings
     were added to working capital.

          Principally as a result of the public offerings and increased
     cash flow from affiliates, including tax sharing payments, the Company
     and its non-regulated affiliates had aggregate cash and temporary
     investments of approximately $204,000,000 at February 28, 1994.  Such
     funds are available for general corporate purposes, including
     acquisitions.  However, the interest rate currently earned on such
     funds is less than the interest paid on the 1993 debt offerings.  In
     addition, at February 28, 1994 the Company had available aggregate
     credit agreement facilities of $150,000,000.  During 1994, the credit
     agreements were renewed and now expire in 1997.  No amounts were
     outstanding at February 28, 1994 under these credit agreement
     facilities.
      
          Effective as of January 1, 1993, as described more fully in Note
     1(a) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company
     adopted SFAS 106 (postretirement benefits), SFAS 109 (income taxes),
     SFAS 112 (postemployment benfits), SFAS 113 (reinsurance) and EITF
     93-6 (retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements).  Although
     adoption of these statements resulted in an aggregate credit of
     $129,195,000 being reported as an element of net income for 1993 and
     an increase in shareholders' equity of $138,605,000, adoption of such
     statements will not affect cash flows, actual income taxes paid or the
     actual utilization of the Company's substantial tax loss
     carryforwards.  However, adoption of SFAS 109 is likely to increase
     reported provisions for income taxes in most periods.

          In addition, as of December 31, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS
     115.  SFAS 115 requires that most securities, other than those meeting
     the requirements for classification as "held-to-maturity," be carried
     on the consolidated balance sheet at market value, either through an
     adjustment to earnings (if classified as "trading securities") or
     through shareholders' equity (if classified as "available for sale"). 
     The Company has classified substantially all of its investment
     portfolio as "available for sale," which resulted in an increase of
     shareholders' equity at December 31, 1993 of approximately
     $49,500,000.  The Company believes SFAS 115 will result in


                                       31<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     

     substantial fluctuations in reported shareholders' equity, but is
     unlikely to have a material effect on results of operations.  For
     additional information with respect to the changes in accounting
     principles, see "Results of Operations," below and Notes to
     Consolidated Financial Statements.

          During 1992, the Company concluded that the profitability of its
     existing SPDA and SPWL business was unlikely to achieve acceptable
     operating results in the future.  Accordingly, principally starting in
     the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company offered certain of its
     existing SPDA policyholders the opportunity to exchange their policies
     for SPDA policies of an unrelated insurer and entered into a
     reinsurance agreement (which closed in stages in 1992 and 1993) to
     reinsure certain blocks of SPDA business with a second unrelated
     insurer.  In connection with the 1993 SPDA closing (which involved
     reinsurance of policies with account balances of approximately
     $47,187,000 on the date of closing in 1993), there was no significant
     net gain or loss.  The Company is maximizing the return on any
     remaining SPDA policies by reducing crediting rates to the minimum
     permitted.  As a result, the Company believes that a substantial
     portion of the remaining SPDA policyholders will terminate their
     policies over a period of time.

          On June 23, 1993, the Company reinsured substantially all of its
     existing blocks of SPWL business with a subsidiary of John Hancock
     Mutual Life Insurance Company ("John Hancock").  In connection with
     the transaction, the Company realized a net pre-tax gain of
     approximately $16,700,000.  Such net pre-tax gain consists of net
     gains on sales of investments sold in connection with the transaction
     (approximately $24,100,000), which are included in the caption "Net
     securities gains," reduced by a net loss of approximately $7,400,000
     (principally the write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs of
     approximately $26,900,000 less the premium received on the
     transaction), which is included in the caption "Provision for
     insurance losses and policy benefits."  Further, the Company may
     receive additional consideration based on the subsequent performance
     of this block of business.  For financial reporting purposes, the
     Company will reflect the policy liabilities assumed by John Hancock
     (in policy reserves), with an offsetting receivable from John Hancock
     of the same amount (in reinsurance receivable, net), until the Company
     is relieved of its legal obligation to the SPWL policyholders.

          During the first quarter of 1994, the Company and an equal
     partner agreed to acquire a 60% interest in Caja de Ahorro y Seguro
     S.A. ("Caja") for a purchase price of approximately $85,000,000,
     subject to final adjustment.  Caja is a holding company whose
     subsidiaries are engaged in property and casualty insurance, life
     insurance and banking in Argentina.  Caja has (unaudited) assets in
     excess of approximately $500,000,000.  Reliable historical operating
     data for Caja is not available.  The Company believes that Caja will
     not constitute a "significant subsidiary."

          On August 16, 1991, the Company acquired CPG.  As described in
     "Results of Operations," CPG has operated profitably and has been a
     substantial contributor to the Company's performance.  Prior to the
     acquisition of CPG, particularly in 1989 and 1990, the property and
     casualty insurance operations of CPG had provided significant
     additional amounts for losses.  At December 31, 1991, the Company
     stated it believed that the reserves established for the Colonial Penn
     P&C Group were adequate, including amounts applicable to the Special
     Risks business.  Since acquisition, the claims and settlement
     experience of the acquired business has been satisfactory and the
     Company continues to believe (in part based on the recent report of an
     independent consulting actuary) that the reserves established for the
     Colonial Penn P&C Group, including the Special Risks business and
     amounts that may be assessed by California and New Jersey, are
     adequate.

          The Company records trading stamp revenues and provides for the
     cost of redemptions at the time trading stamps are furnished to
     licensees.  A liability for unredeemed trading stamps is estimated
     based on the cost of merchandise, cash and related redemption service
     expenses required to redeem the trading stamps which



                                       32<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     

     are expected to be presented for redemption in the future.  The
     Company periodically reviews the appropriateness of the estimated
     redemption rates based upon recent experience, statistical evaluations
     and other relevant factors.  At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the
     liability for unredeemed trading stamps reflected in the Company's
     consolidated balance sheet was $58,541,000 and $74,964,000,
     respectively.  The most recent statistical studies of trading stamp
     redemptions have indicated that the historical pattern of redemptions
     has changed and that the recorded liability for unredeemed trading
     stamps is in excess of the amount that ultimately will be required to
     redeem trading stamps outstanding.  The amount of this excess may be
     different than indicated by these studies.  Accordingly, the Company
     is amortizing the aggregate apparent excess over a five year period
     (starting in 1990 with respect to approximately $34,000,000 of such
     apparent excess and in 1991 with respect to approximately $28,000,000
     of such apparent excess).  Based upon the latest studies, the
     unamortized apparent excess was approximately $17,067,000 at December
     31, 1993.  The Company will continue to monitor current redemptions
     and estimates of ultimate redemptions.

          The government of El Salvador and representatives of the Company
     had previously reached agreement as to the amount to be paid for the
     assets of an electric utility in El Salvador in which the Company had
     an interest.  Pursuant to such agreement, on March 30, 1993, the
     Company received cash of approximately $5,300,000 and approximately
     $12,000,000 principal amount of 6% U.S. dollar denominated El Salvador
     Government bonds due in instalments through 1996.  The gain recognized
     during 1993 was not material.  As a result of receiving required
     prepayments and the sale of the bonds, the Company will report a pre-
     tax gain of approximately $8,458,000 in the first quarter of 1994.

          In connection with the formation of JII on June 1, 1988, John W.
     Jordan II, a director and significant shareholder of the Company,
     acquired from the Company most of the Company's direct interest in JII
     in exchange for a zero coupon note which matured in 1993.  On June 1,
     1993 Mr. Jordan delivered to the Company 224,175 of the Company's
     Common Shares valued at $8,294,000 (the maturity value of the zero
     coupon note) as payment in full of the zero coupon note.  The Common
     Shares were valued at $37.00 per share, the closing price of a Common
     Share on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on May 24, 1993,
     the last full trading day prior to the authorization by the Company's
     Board of Directors of the agreement.

          The Company is to receive the residual interest in CLIC and
     Credit from the Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner without additional
     consideration.  The Company estimates that the value of the net
     tangible assets of such companies to the Company was approximately
     $32,800,000 in excess of their carrying amount at December 31, 1993. 
     The underlying assets of such companies are principally invested in
     high quality interest earning securities.  The timing for receipt of
     such assets is uncertain.

          During 1993 and 1992, the property and casualty insurance
     industry suffered unprecedented losses from natural disasters,
     principally Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and snow storm and fire related
     losses in 1993.  The Company's insurance subsidiaries also suffered
     certain of such losses, although as described below in "Results of
     Operations," reinsurance reduced the economic loss to the Company
     related to Hurricane Andrew.  However, as a result of the industry's
     losses, the Company has seen a notable decrease in the availability of
     catastrophe reinsurance at reasonable rates, particularly at low
     levels of deductibility.  Although the reinsurance programs were
     completed at acceptable upper loss limits (albeit at a somewhat
     increased cost), the insurance subsidiaries have been unable to obtain
     previous levels of deductibility at reasonable cost.  Accordingly, for
     1994 and 1993 the Company has increased its retention of lower level
     losses to $11,000,000.  In 1992, the Company did not incur losses in
     excess of its maximum reinsurance.  Further, the Company did not incur
     catastrophic losses in excess of its retained limits in 1993 and to
     date in 1994.  In January 1994, Los Angeles experienced severe
     earthquakes.  As a result, the Company suffered losses estimated at
     approximately $7,000,000 to $10,000,000.  In addition, severe winter
     storms in 1994 resulted in unusually high losses.



                                       33<PAGE>

          New Jersey's insurance laws require all automobile insurers to
     share in the losses of the MTF based on their depopulation share of
     the JUA, as set by the New Jersey Department of Insurance.  Although
     the amount of the MTF deficit has not yet been finalized, based on
     certain current estimates of the MTF deficit (which are subject to
     change), the Colonial Penn P&C Group would be assessed approximately
     $11,100,000.  While the New Jersey Insurance Department has adopted
     regulations which would permit an insurer, with the approval of the
     Insurance Department, to recover amounts paid to the MTF through
     surcharges to policyholders, there can be no assurance that the
     Colonial Penn P&C Group would be permitted to surcharge its
     policyholders for all or even part of any future deficit assessment. 
     The Colonial Penn P&C Group has provided for its portion of the
     estimated MTF losses.

          The NAIC has adopted a model law incorporating the concept of a
     "risk based capital" ("RBC") requirement for insurance companies,
     although the model law is not intended to apply to property and
     casualty insurance companies until year end 1994 financial statements
     are available.  Generally, RBC is designed to measure the adequacy of
     an insurer's statutory capital in relation to the risks inherent in
     the business.  The RBC formula will be used by the states as an early
     warning tool to identify weakly capitalized companies for the purpose
     of initiating regulatory action.  The RBC ratios of the Company's
     insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 were substantially in
     excess of the minimum requirements.

          The Company and certain of its subsidiaries including Phlcorp and
     its subsidiaries, have substantial loss carryforwards and other tax
     attributes (see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
     Statements).  The amount and availability of tax loss carryforwards
     are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties,
     including, with respect to Phlcorp and its subsidiaries, tax sharing
     payments pursuant to a tax settlement agreement with the Internal
     Revenue Service and the Department of Justice.  In order to reduce the
     possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations
     on the use of these carryforwards which could reduce their value to
     the Company, the Company's shareholders, at a special meeting held on
     December 30, 1992, imposed certain charter restrictions which
     generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating
     five percent or more of the Common Shares and the ability of persons
     or entities now owning at least five percent of the Common Shares from
     acquiring additional Common Shares.  Upon implementation of SFAS 109,
     the Company recognized as an asset (net of reserves) certain of the
     benefits of such loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. 
     However, the amount of the asset recognized only reflects the minimum
     Phlcorp tax loss carryforwards and assumes that certain proposed
     regulations affecting the use of Phlcorp's tax loss carryforwards are
     finalized without significant change.  As described in the
     accompanying financial statements, significant additional amounts may
     be available under certain circumstances.

          The Company's fixed maturity investments are generally
     "investment grade" or U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed
     obligations, although limited investments in "non-rated" or rated less
     than "investment grade" securities have been made from time to time. 
     The Company believes that it provides for potential losses on its
     investments upon early indications that a decline in the market value
     of a particular security may be other than temporary.  The cost and
     market/carrying value of the Company's investments in "non-rated" or
     less than "investment grade" rated securities was approximately
     $40,218,000 and $48,351,000 at December 31, 1993, respectively.  At
     December 31, 1993, less than 1% of the insurance subsidiaries fixed
     maturity investment portfolio was rated by Moody's and/or S&P as less
     than "investment grade" or was not rated.

          The Company continuously evaluates its existing operations and
     investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses and dispositions
     of businesses in order to maximize its ultimate economic value to
     shareholders.  Accordingly, while the Company does not have any
     material arrangement, commitment or understanding with respect
     thereto, except as described in this Report, further acquisitions,
     divestitures, investments and changes in



                                      34<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     

     capital structure are possible.  The Company also believes based on
     discussions with commercial and investment bankers that it has the
     ability to raise significant additional funds under acceptable
     conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate
     investment opportunities.

     several direct subsidiaries.  As described below, its principal

     distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management
     and other fees, and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and
     non-regulated subsidiaries.  It has no substantial recurring cash
     requirements other than payment of interest and principal on its debt,
     tax payments and expenses of its corporate offices.

          The Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and
     its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to
     certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries.  These borrowings have
     primarily been made on an unsecured basis from banks through various
     credit agreement facilities and term loans, and through public
     financings.  As noted above, during 1993, the Company issued an
     aggregate of $200,000,000 principal amount of senior debt securities
     and subordinated convertible debt securities in underwritten public
     offerings.  Although the Company had no specific use for such funds
     (the proceeds of the offerings were principally invested on a
     temporary basis), the Company believes that it was prudent to borrow
     long term funds at rates that were historically attractive.  As a
     result of these offerings and other sources of funds, at February 28,
     1994, the Company and its wholly owned non-regulated subsidiaries had
     cash and temporary investments of approximately $204,000,000.

          There are no restrictions on distributions from the wholly owned
     non-regulated subsidiaries and therefore all cash available to these
     subsidiaries (including proceeds from sales of their investments in
     marketable securities) is available to the Parent.  At December 31,
     1993, a maximum of approximately $50,590,000 was available to the
     Parent as dividends from the regulated subsidiaries without regulatory
     approval.  Additional amounts may be available to the Parent in the
     form of loans or cash advances from such regulated subsidiaries.  The
     Parent (and Phlcorp) also receive tax sharing payments from their
     subsidiaries included in consolidated tax returns, including certain
     regulated subsidiaries.  Because of the tax loss carryforwards
     available to the Parent (and Phlcorp) and current interest deductions,
     the amount paid by the Parent (and Phlcorp) for income taxes is
     substantially less than tax sharing payments received from the
     subsidiaries.  In addition, the Company believes significant amounts
     are available from the regulated and non-regulated entities for
     services provided by the Parent.  The Parent also has borrowed
     short-term funds from time to time from its regulated subsidiaries (as
     permitted by applicable regulations), although no amounts were
     outstanding at December 31, 1993 and no amounts were borrowed to date
     in 1994.  Furthermore, as previously noted, the Parent has recently
     renewed its credit agreements which provide for aggregate credit
     agreement facilities of $150,000,000.  No significant amounts were
     borrowed in 1993 or to date in 1994 under such agreements.  

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

          CPG is included in results of operations from its date of
     acquisition, August 16, 1991.  For the year ended December 31, 1992,
     CPG contributed revenues of approximately $836,552,000 (including net
     gains on sales of securities of approximately $23,543,000) and
     contributed approximately $131,757,000 to consolidated pre-tax income
     (exclusive of financing costs).  For the period from August 16, 1991
     to December 31, 1991, CPG contributed revenues of approximately
     $359,088,000 (including net gains on sales of securities of
     approximately $16,323,000) and contributed approximately $59,995,000
     to consolidated pre-tax income (exclusive of financing costs).  Due to
     changes in the Company's insurance operations it is not practicable to

     provide meanful comparable information for CPG for 1993.  Except as
     disclosed herein, the material changes in results of operations for
     the year ended December 31, 1992 compared to the preceding year result
     from the acquisition of CPG.

          Premium receipts on investment oriented products of the life
     insurance subsidiaries (which are not reflected as revenues) were
     approximately $88,312,000 in 1993, $68,035,000 in 1992 and $43,164,000
     in 1991.  The principal investment oriented product sold during the
     three year period ended December 31, 1993 was a tax-advantaged VA
     product marketed directly to consumers.  Increases in premium receipts
     in 1993 and 1992 may in part result from Federal tax law changes
     anticipated in 1992 and enacted in 1993.  Substantially all other life
     insurance earned premiums relate to the CPG operations.

          Earned premium revenues of the life and health insurance
     operations were approximately $181,800,000 for 1993 compared to
     $233,700,000 for 1992.  The decrease reflected the termination of
     certain assumed life and health reinsurance contracts which had
     revenues of approximately $28,750,000 for 1992 and minimal
     profitability (except for termination gains of approximately
     $6,200,000 recognized in 1992).  In addition, earned premium revenues
     decreased as a result of the run-off of the agent sold medicare
     supplement business, which the Company ceased marketing at December
     31, 1992 due to inadequate profitability.  

          During 1993, based on its experience since acquisition, the
     Company concluded that it would be able to generate significant new
     premiums for its Graded Benefit Life business at acquisition cost
     levels that result in adequate profitability.  Accordingly, starting
     in 1993, the Company increased its marketing efforts with respect to
     this product.

          Earned premium revenues and commissions of the property and
     casualty insurance operations of the Empire Group were approximately
     $259,400,000 in 1993, $243,100,000 in 1992 and $210,700,000 in 1991. 
     The increases (as compared to the preceding year) are principally due
     to increases in certain premium rates        (4.3% in 1993 and 6.2% in
     1992) and increased premium volume (2.4% in 1993 and 9.2% in 1992).

          Earned premium revenues of the Colonial Penn property and
     casualty insurance operations were approximately $452,600,000 in 1993
     and $456,000,000 in 1992.  Earned premiums in 1993 reflect an increase
     in involuntary auto insurance resulting from assigned risk business. 
     The 1993 decline in other business was anticipated and is principally
     the result of the substantial reduction in marketing costs incurred
     prior to acquisition, which the Company believes were not justified by
     prior operating results.  As described more fully elsewhere herein,
     the Colonial Penn property and casualty insurance operations are using
     other means to market their products.  The Company believes its
     present marketing efforts have resulted in new business which to some
     degree offsets the normal attrition of existing business.  The Company
     believes that it is likely that new business generated in 1994 will be
     greater than business lost through normal attrition, although there
     can be no assurance that this will be achieved.  

          Manufacturing revenues and cost of goods sold in 1993 and 1992
     increased slightly from amounts from the preceding year. 
     Manufacturing gross profit was substantially unchanged in 1993 and
     lower in 1992 than 1991.  The decline in 1992 was due to certain
     manufacturing inefficiencies and start up costs associated with the
     Company's new bathroom vanity manufacturing facility,
     under-utilization of facilities in part due to general unfavorable
     economic conditions and pricing pressures.  These inefficiencies
     contributed to the manufacturing operations having a small loss in
     1991 and a substantially larger loss in 1993 and 1992.  Although the
     new manufacturing plant decreased its inefficiencies in 1993, the
     plant continues to operate at unacceptable efficiency levels.  During
     1993, the Company instituted actions that it believes should improve
     efficiency to acceptable levels in 1994 and 1995, although there can
     be no assurance as to that effect.

          Trading stamps revenues were lower in 1993 and 1992 than the
     preceding year principally due to the loss of business of certain
     customers.  The Company believes the historical decline in usage of
     trading stamps will continue.  The Company provided the liability for
     unredeemed trading stamps based on the estimate that approximately 75%
     of stamps issued in each of 1993, 1992 and 1991 ultimately will be
     redeemed.  The gross profit rate was higher in 1992 than in 1991
     principally due to lower merchandise costs.  In early 1993, the
     Company contributed the net assets of its motivation services business
     to a new joint venture formed with an unrelated motivation services
     company in exchange for a 45% equity interest in the joint venture. 
     The joint venture is recorded on the equity basis of accounting. 
     Results of operations of the motivation services business have
     historically not been significant and are not expected to be
     significant in the future.

          Finance revenues reflect the level of consumer instalment loans. 
     In 1992 the Company sold at a profit substantially all of its consumer
     loan development offices, which had aggregate consumer instalment
     loans at the time of sale of approximately $68,500,000.  As expected,
     the operating profit applicable to this segment increased in 1993 as
     the offices sold in 1992 operated at a loss.  Based on its experience
     since 1988 in providing automobile collateralized loans to individuals
     with poor credit histories, during 1993 the Company concluded that
     there were excellent opportunities for successful expansion of this
     business.  Accordingly, on a controlled basis, the Company increased
     its investment in such loans.  Such loans approximated $73,321,000 at
     December 31, 1993 and $47,890,000 at December 31, 1992.  The Company
     expects to further increase such loans in 1994.

          Investment and other income decreased in 1993 compared to 1992. 
     The decrease was the result of a lower level of investments due to
     disposition of the SPWL and SPDA business and lower interest rates. 
     Exclusive of CPG, investment and other income decreased in 1992
     compared to 1991.  The investment earnings of the non-CPG insurance
     subsidiaries were lower in 1992 compared to the prior year in part due
     to a reduction in Charter's investment portfolio to fund a substantial
     portion of the CPG purchase price.  The estimated average yield to
     maturity of bonds and notes in the Company's investment portfolio was
     lower at December 31, 1993 and 1992 than at the preceding year end. 
     The decreased yield resulted in part from the reinvestment of sales
     proceeds at the generally prevailing lower interest rates.  Further,
     other income in 1991 includes approximately $9,359,000 related to the
     resolution of certain pre-acquisition contingencies related to
     Cambrian, a consolidated subsidiary.  The $12,981,000 gain in 1993
     from the sale of a portion of the investment in Bolivian Power and the
     $12,128,000 gain in 1992 from sale of the consumer loan development
     offices is reflected in other income.

    </TABLE>

          The proceeds from sales of investments were primarily reinvested
     at the generally lower prevailing interest rates.  Since these
     reinvestment rates were, in certain instances, lower than had
     previously been expected on certain fixed rate annuity policies issued
     by the life insurance subsidiaries, in 1993 and 1991 the Company
     provided approximately $6,800,000 and $8,800,000, respectively, which
     is included in results of operations under the caption, "Provision for
     insurance losses and policy benefits."  In 1992, as a result of
     realizing securities gains and reinvestment of sales proceeds at the
     lower prevailing interest rates, and securities gains realized in
     connection with the termination or transfer of the SPDA business, the
     Company recalculated and eliminated deferred policy acquisition costs
     applicable to certain of its investment oriented products (including
     the SPDA policies), reviewed the expected and required return on
     certain fixed income products and, as a result, provided additional
     reserves of approximately $13,900,000, which is included in the
     caption "Provision for insurance losses and policy benefits" in 1992
     results of operations.  These reinvestment risks do not apply to the
     Company's currently offered variable investment oriented products.

          The provision for insurance losses and policy benefits of the
     life and health operations decreased in the 1993 period compared to
     the 1992 period, principally due to lower earned premiums and
     insurance in force, (including the SPDA and SPWL business that was
     sold in late 1992 and 1993).  However, the provision for insurance
     losses and policy benefits of the life and health operations for 1993
     includes a net loss of approximately $7,400,000 (principally the
     write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs less the premium
     received) applicable to the SPWL business sold to John Hancock and
     additional provisions of approximately $6,800,000 applicable to
     certain fixed rate policies due to realization of securities gains and
     reinvestment of proceeds at the lower prevailing interest rates, as
     described more fully above.

          The provision for insurance losses and policy benefits of the
     life and health operations exclusive of CPG increased in 1992 compared
     to 1991 principally due to the growth in earned premiums and the
     additional amounts provided by the life insurance subsidiaries as a
     result of the realized securities gains described above.  Further, the
     spread between amounts credited to policyholders by the life insurance
     subsidiaries and amounts earned on investments was reduced in 1992 as
     compared to 1991.  As a result of the termination of certain
     reinsurance arrangements by the life insurance subsidiaries,
     approximately $6,200,000, representing amounts


                                       38<PAGE>

     provided for policyholder benefits that were no longer required, is
     reflected as a reduction in the provision for insurance losses and
     policy benefits for 1992.

          The Company's property and casualty insurance operations combined
     ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were as follows:

     Year ended December 31,                   GAAP          SAP 
                                              ------       ------
      1993                                    96.9%       93.7%
                                               1992      101.7%102.8%
                                               1991      102.1%103.3%

          For the Colonial Penn P&C Group, the severity of personal
     automobile claims was substantially more favorable in 1993 than in
     1992 and the frequency of such claims was substantially more favorable
     in 1992 than in the prior year.  The Company believes this experience
     reflects its improved underwriting procedures, emphasis on over 50
     year old insureds and prior rate increases.  In addition, the combined
     ratio and the provision for losses applicable to the property and
     casualty operations for 1993 were favorably affected due to settlement
     of prior years' claims at amounts less than had been provided.  The
     overall loss experience of the Empire Group's property and casualty
     insurance subsidiaries was less favorable in 1992 than in 1991
     primarily as a result of unfavorable loss experience in automobile
     lines and an approximately $3,000,000 retroactive assessment for a
     workers' compensation fund.  The Company believes that as a result of
     the reduction in claims outstanding for the Colonial Penn P&C Group,
     there will be a reduced positive effect on future results of
     operations from settlement of claims at less than amounts previously
     provided in spite of providing loss reserves on current operations at
     very conservative levels.

          The provision for insurance losses and policy benefits in 1993
     and 1992 (including CPG) also includes catastrophe losses (net of
     reinsurance recoveries in 1992) estimated at an aggregate of
     approximately $10,900,000 in 1993 and $12,300,000 in 1992 (including
     amounts related to Hurricane Andrew in 1992).  In addition, in 1992,
     the Company provided approximately $1,000,000 to reinstate certain
     reinsurance coverage which was exhausted in connection with Hurricane
     Andrew.  

          Interest expense principally reflects the level of external
     borrowings outstanding during the period and, in each year compared to
     the preceding year, the effect of lower interest rates.  Interest
     expense in 1992 also reflects a lower level of intercompany borrowings
     from Phlcorp during 1992, which resulted in increased interest charges
     of approximately $4,880,000 in 1992 compared to 1991.  Additionally,
     interest expense reflects the level of Deposits at AIB and the ILCs. 
     Generally, interest rates on Deposits are lower than on other
     available funds.  Interest on Deposits was approximately $9,001,000 in
     1993, $11,954,000 in 1992 and $15,138,000 in 1991.  The Company
     estimates that in 1993, the interest expense on its borrowings which
     were invested in temporary investments exceeded interest earned by
     approximately $2,500,000.

          Selling, general and other expenses in 1991 includes costs
     applicable to development by the trading stamps subsidiary of a
     database marketing program of approximately $8,237,000 (including
     close down costs).  In 1991 the Company discontinued development of
     the program due to a lack of acceptance by food manufacturers.

          Minority interest in 1992 and 1991 was principally applicable to
     the Phlcorp Minority Interest.  On December 31, 1992, the Company
     acquired the Phlcorp Minority Interest in exchange for approximately
     4,408,000 Common Shares.

          Income before income taxes and the effects of accounting changes
     was $176,868,000 in 1993, $143,553,000 in 1992 and $95,030,000 in
     1991.  The amount for 1993 was the highest in the history of the
     Company.

          The provision for income taxes for 1993 was calculated under SFAS
     109 which does not reflect the benefit from utilization of tax loss
     carryforwards.  The provisions for income taxes for 1992 and 1991 have
     been reduced for the benefit from utilization of tax loss
     carryforwards.  The provision for income taxes for 1993 was reduced by
     approximately $8,315,000 as a result of tax law changes and a
     reduction in the valuation allowance applicable to certain deferred
     tax assets.  The Company estimates that if the 1993 tax provision had
     been calculated as it was in 1992 and 1991, such provision would have
     been lower by, and net income (exclusive of amounts applicable to
     changes in accounting principles) would have been higher by
     approximately $42,614,000 (or $1.46 per primary earnings per share and
     $1.38 per fully diluted earnings per share).

          The provisions for income taxes for 1992 and 1991 principally
     consist of state income taxes, the federal alternative minimum income
     tax, federal income taxes applicable to the life insurance
     subsidiaries which cannot utilize the Company's tax loss carryforwards
     and United Kingdom income taxes applicable to Cambrian.  The 1991
     provision reflects credits of approximately $5,400,000, resulting from
     the favorable outcome of certain prior years' United Kingdom income
     tax matters.  As noted above, the tax provisions for 1992 and 1991
     reflect the benefit from utilization of accounting and tax loss
     carryforwards, including capital loss carryforwards.

          The number of shares used to calculate primary earnings per share
     was 29,270,000, 24,435,000 and 23,704,000 for 1993, 1992 and 1991,
     respectively.  The number of shares used to calculate fully diluted
     earnings per share was 30,743,000, 24,516,000 and 23,916,000 for 1993,
     1992 and 1991, respectively.  The increase in 1993 was principally
     caused by the acquisition of the Phlcorp Minority Interest and, with
     respect to fully diluted per share amounts, the effect of the assumed
     conversion of the 5 1/4% Convertible Debentures.  The increase in the
     number of shares utilized in calculating per share amounts in 1992
     compared to 1991 was principally caused by the exercise of options to
     purchase common shares and the increase in the market price per common
     share.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


      To the Board of Directors of Leucadia National Corporation:


     We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the
     financial statement schedules of LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION
     and SUBSIDIARIES listed in Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K.  These
     financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
     responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
     is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
     financial statement schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
     auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
     perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
     the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
     audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
     the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
     audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
     significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
     the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
     our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
     present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
     financial position of LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION and
     SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
     consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
     each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  In
     addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules
     referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic
     financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
     material respects, the information required to be included
     therein.

     As more fully discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
     statements, in 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting
     for Income Taxes, Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions,
     Postemployment Benefits, Re-insurance of Short-Duration and Long-
     Duration Contracts, Multiple-Year Retrospectively Rated
     Contracts, and Certain Investments in Debt and Capital
     Securities, all as set forth in various pronouncements of the
     Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Emerging Issues Task
     Force.

     LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     1.  Significant Accounting Policies:
         -------------------------------

     (a) Changes in Accounting Policies:  Effective as of January 1, 1993,
         ------------------------------
     the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
     109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"), Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
     Benefits Other Than Pensions" ("SFAS 106"), Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standards No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
     Benefits" ("SFAS 112"), Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
     No. 113 "Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration
     and Long-Duration Contracts" ("SFAS 113") and Financial Accounting
     Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No. 93-6
     "Accounting for Multiple-Year Retrospectively Rated Contracts by
     Ceding and Assuming Enterprises" ("EITF 93-6").  As a result of
     adoption of SFAS 106, SFAS 109, SFAS 112 and EITF 93-6, the cumulative
     effects of such changes through January 1, 1993 were recorded as of
     the date of adoption and were principally reflected in results of
     operations as "Cumulative effects of changes in accounting
     principles."  In addition, as a result of adoption of SFAS 109,
     certain acquired intangibles were reduced (for benefits of acquired
     tax loss carryforwards) and shareholders' equity was directly
     increased (as a result of prior stock transactions). 

     SFAS 106, SFAS 112 and EITF 93-6 had no material effect on income
     before cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles for 1993
     and are unlikely to have a material effect on future results of
     operations.

     Effective as of December 31, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain
     Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115").  Adoption of
     SFAS 115 had no material effect on results of operations but did
     increase shareholders' equity by approximately $49,500,000 at December
     31, 1993 as described more fully in Note 1(e).

     (b) Consolidation Policy:  The consolidated financial statements
         --------------------
     include the accounts of the Company and all significant majority-owned
     subsidiaries.  The Company's subsidiary, Phlcorp, Inc. ("Phlcorp") has
     several legal subsidiaries (the "WMAC Companies") which are, or were,
     under the control of the Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner (the
     "Commissioner").  These companies are not consolidated while under the
     control of the Commissioner.

     Investments in certain other entities in which the Company owns less
     than 50% of the voting interest and has the ability to exercise
     significant influence are accounted for on the equity method of
     accounting.  Amounts related to such companies have not been material.

     Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to be
     consistent with the 1993 presentation.

     (c) Stock Split:  On January 8, 1993, a two-for-one stock split was
         -----------
     effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.  The financial
     statements (and notes thereto) give retroactive effect to the stock
     split for all periods presented.

     (d) Statement of Cash Flows:  The Company considers short-term
         -----------------------
     investments (generally investments with maturities of less than three
     months at the  time of acquisition) as cash equivalents.
     As described in Note 2, on August 16, 1991, the Company acquired
     Colonial Penn Group, Inc. ("Colonial Penn") for cash of approximately
     $128,000,000.  The acquired assets were recorded at an aggregate of


              The accompanying notes are an integral part of these
                       consolidated financial statements.

         -------------------------------

     approximately $1,950,000,000 (principally investments in securities)
     and the acquired liabilities were recorded at an aggregate of
     approximately $1,822,000,000 (principally policy reserves and unearned
     premiums). 

     Also, as described in Note 2, on December 31, 1992, the Company
     acquired the minority interest in Phlcorp (the "Phlcorp Minority
     Interest") for approximately 4,408,000 of the Company's Common Shares
     which were recorded at an aggregate of approximately $142,927,000,
     including costs.  Because Phlcorp was a consolidated subsidiary, the
     Phlcorp Minority Interest (approximately $92,819,000) was eliminated
     and the difference between the consideration issued and the minority
     interest eliminated was principally allocated to investments in
     associated companies (approximately $11,022,000), amounts related to
     the WMAC Companies (approximately $16,847,000) and excess of purchase
     price over net assets acquired (approximately $22,277,000).  The
     amount allocated to excess of purchase price over net assets acquired
     was eliminated as a result of the adoption of SFAS 109.

     On June 1, 1993, the Company received 224,175 of the Company's Common
     Shares (valued at $8,294,000) in settlement of a zero coupon note due
     from John W. Jordan II, a Director of the Company and a significant
     shareholder.  Based on the market price of the shares on the date the
     transaction was approved by the Board of Directors, the value of the
     shares received was equal to the maturity value of the note.

     (e) Investments:  Prior to December 31, 1993, investments were carried
         -----------
     at amortized cost with respect to fixed maturities (other than those
     classified as held for sale) and policyholder loans.  Investments were
     carried at market with respect to marketable equity securities of the
     insurance subsidiaries and options that did not meet the accounting
     definition of a hedge and at the lower of cost or market (in the
     aggregate) for other marketable equity securities.

     Prior to adoption of SFAS 115, the Company classified a portion of the
     insurance subsidiaries' investment portfolios as "held for sale." 
     Such investments were carried at the lower of cost or market.  A
     substantial portion of the proceeds from disposition of the portfolio
     classified as held for sale were invested in other securities.

     The Company adopted SFAS 115 on December 31, 1993.  Under SFAS 115 
     marketable debt and equity securities are designated as i) "held to
     maturity" (carried at cost), ii) "trading" (carried at market with
     differences between cost and market being reflected in results of
     operations) or iii) if not otherwise classified, as "available for
     sale" (carried at market with differences between cost and market
     being reflected as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net
     of income tax effect).  The adoption of SFAS 115 resulted in an
     increase in reported shareholders' equity of approximately
     $49,500,000.  The Company does not expect that SFAS 115 will have a
     material effect on future results of operations, although the Company
     believes SFAS 115 is likely to result in substantial fluctuations in
     reported shareholders' equity.

     The fixed maturity investments of the insurance subsidiaries (other
     than those classified as "trading") are made with the intention of
     holding such securities to maturity and the Company has the ability to
     do so.

     Both prior and subsequent to adoption of SFAS 115, declines in market
     value below cost which are considered other than temporary are charged
     to results of operations.  For determining realized gain or loss on
     securities sold, cost is based on average cost.

     Net unrealized gain on investments at December 31, 1993 is net of
     deferred income taxes of $27,091,000.

     (f) Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements:  Property,
         ----------------------------------------------
     equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of
     accumulated depreciation and amortization (approximately $73,640,000
     and $65,150,000 at

                                       F-8<PAGE>
<PAGE>

     1.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
         -------------------------------

     December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively). Depreciation and amortization
     are provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated
     useful lives of the assets or, if less, the term of the lease.  

     (g) Income Recognition from Insurance Operations:  Premiums on the
         --------------------------------------------
     property and casualty insurance business are recognized as revenues
     over the term of the policy using the monthly pro rata basis.

     The life insurance subsidiaries have had several investment oriented
     insurance products (collectively the "IOP products"), principally
     consisting of single premium whole life ("SPWL") products, a variable
     life ("VL") product, variable annuity ("VA") products and a single
     premium deferred annuity ("SPDA") product.  IOP product premiums are
     reflected in a manner similar to a deposit; revenues reflect only
     mortality charges and other amounts assessed against the holder of the
     insurance policies and annuity contracts.  Other life premiums are
     recognized as revenues when due.  Health premiums are recognized as
     revenues over the premium paying period.

     Premiums for the VA and VL products are directed by the policyholder
     to be invested generally in a unit trust solely for the benefit and
     risk of the policyholder.  Such investments are considered a "separate
     account."  Policyholder's accounts are charged for the cost of
     insurance provided, administrative and certain other charges.  The
     amounts included in the balance sheet as policy reserves for the VA
     and VL products represent the current value of the policyholders'
     funds.

     (h) Policy Acquisition Costs:  Policy acquisition costs principally
         ------------------------
     consist of direct response marketing costs, commissions, premium taxes
     and other underwriting expenses (net of reinsurance allowances).  If
     recoverability of such costs is not anticipated, the amounts not
     considered recoverable are charged to operations.  During the three
     years ended December 31, 1993, the Company has also written-off or
     reduced deferred policy acquisition costs in connection with
     dispositions of blocks of business or reinvestment of proceeds from
     security sales at the lower prevailing interest rates.

     Policy acquisition costs applicable to the property and casualty
     insurance operations are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms
     of the related policies.

     Policy acquisition costs applicable to IOP products are deferred and
     amortized as a level percentage of the present value of expected gross
     profits over the estimated life of each policy.  The Company regularly
     compares its actual experience to the previously expected gross profit
     and reviews revised estimates of expected future gross profits.  When
     significant changes occur, deferred policy acquisition costs are
     recalculated and the resultant adjustment is reflected in results of 
     operations.

     Policy acquisition costs applicable to other life insurance products
     are amortized over the expected premium paying period of the policies.

     (i) Reinsurance:  In the normal course of business, the Company seeks
         -----------
     to reduce the loss that may arise from catastrophes or other events
     that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain
     levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance
     enterprises or reinsurers.  The Company has also entered into
     reinsurance transactions in connection with dispositions of blocks of
     businesses.  Reinsurance contracts do not necessarily relieve the
     Company from its obligations to policyholders. 

     Prior to January 1, 1993, losses, loss adjustment expenses and
     unearned premiums were stated net of reinsurance ceded, as were
     premiums earned and other underwriting expenses.  Under SFAS 113,
     which was adopted as of January 1, 1993, the effects of certain
     reinsurance transactions are no longer deducted from the related asset
     or liability.  As a result of adoption of SFAS 113, at December 31,
     1993 certain assets (principally 

                                       F-9<PAGE>
<PAGE>

     1.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
         -------------------------------
     reinsurance receivables) and policy reserves were each greater by
     approximately $457,621,000, representing reinsured amounts that prior
     to the adoption of SFAS 113 would have been deducted from the related
     asset or liability.  Under SFAS 113 and the prior accounting, appropriate
     provisions are made for uncollectible reinsurance receivables.  Although
     SFAS 113 did not have a material effect on results of operations, it is
     likely to affect the way certain new reinsurance transactions or
     extensions or amendments of existing reinsurance contracts are reported.

     (j) Policy Reserves and Unearned Premiums:  Policy reserves and
         -------------------------------------
     unearned premiums for life, health and traditional annuity policies
     are computed on a net level premium method based upon standard and
     Company developed tables with provision for adverse deviation and
     estimated withdrawals.  Liabilities for unpaid losses and loss
     adjustment expenses applicable to the property and casualty insurance
     operations are determined using case basis evaluations, statistical
     analyses for losses incurred but not reported and estimates for
     salvage and subrogation recoverable and represent estimates of
     ultimate claim costs and loss adjustment expenses.

     Effective as of January 1, 1993, the Company adopted EITF 93-6 which
     specifies the accounting for certain retrospectively rated reinsurance
     agreements.  EITF 93-6 is applicable to a small number of per risk,
     excess of loss reinsurance policies entered into in the normal course
     of the Empire Insurance Company and subsidiaries' (the "Empire Group")
     property and casualty insurance business.  As a result of the adoption
     of EITF 93-6, the Company (retroactive to January 1, 1993) reduced its
     policy reserves at January 1, 1993 by approximately $14,654,000 and
     recorded a credit of approximately $9,672,000 (net of income taxes of
     $4,982,000) which is included in the caption "Cumulative effects of
     changes in accounting principles."  If the accounting specified by
     EITF 93-6 had been in effect in 1992 and 1991, the resulting increase
     in income before cumulative effects of changes in accounting
     principles for each of those years would not have been material.

     (k) Trading Stamp Revenue and Liability for Unredeemed Trading Stamps:
         -----------------------------------------------------------------
     The Company records trading stamp revenues and provides for the cost
     of redemptions at the time trading stamps are furnished to licensees. 
     A liability for unredeemed trading stamps is estimated based upon the
     cost of merchandise, cash and related redemption service expenses
     required to redeem the trading stamps which are expected to be
     presented for redemption in the future.  The Company periodically
     reviews the appropriateness of the estimated redemption rates based
     upon recent experience, statistical evaluations and other relevant
     factors.  The most recent statistical studies of trading stamp
     redemptions have indicated that the historical pattern of redemptions
     has changed and that the recorded liability for unredeemed trading
     stamps is in excess of the amount that ultimately will be required to
     redeem trading stamps outstanding.  Although the Company believes a
     significant change in redemption patterns has occurred, the amount of
     the excess may be different than indicated by these studies. 
     Accordingly, the Company is amortizing the aggregate apparent excess
     over a five year period (starting in 1990 with respect to
     approximately $34,000,000 of such apparent excess and in 1991 with
     respect to approximately $28,000,000 of such apparent excess).  As a
     result, after giving effect to related adjustments, cost of goods sold
     applicable to the trading stamp operations reflects a credit of
     approximately $11,900,000, $14,100,000 and $13,700,000 for the years
     ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Based on the
     latest studies the unamortized apparent excess at December 31, 1993
     was approximately $17,067,000.  The Company provided the liability for
     unredeemed trading stamps based on the estimate that approximately 75%
     of stamps issued in each of the three years ended December 31, 1993
     ultimately will be redeemed.
<PAGE>
     (l) Motivation Services Revenues:  Motivation services revenues are
         ----------------------------
     generally recorded when awards are redeemed or travel programs are
     completed.  Customer deposits for travel programs and the Company's
     related costs are deferred until such programs are completed.  In
     early 1993, the Company contributed the net assets of the motivation
     service business to a new joint venture formed with an unrelated
     motivation services company in exchange for a 45% equity interest in
     the joint venture.  Results of operations of the motivation services
     business have historically not been significant and are not expected
     to be significant in the future.

     1.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
         -------------------------------

     (m) Pension, Postemployment and Postretirement Costs:  There are
         ------------------------------------------------
     non-contributory trusteed pension plans, which cover certain
     employees, which generally provide for retirement benefits based on
     salary and length of service.  The plans are funded in amounts
     sufficient to satisfy minimum ERISA funding requirements.

     Certain subsidiaries provide health care and other benefits to certain
     eligible retired employees.  The plans (most of which require employee
     contributions) are unfunded.  Prior to January 1, 1993, the costs of 
     such benefits were expensed generally as incurred, although
     liabilities for benefits were recorded in connection with certain
     acquisitions, including that of Colonial Penn and the Phlcorp Minority
     Interest.  Effective as of January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS
     106 and SFAS 112 which require companies to accrue the cost of
     providing certain postretirement and postemployment benefits during
     the employees' period of service.  The Company does not expect SFAS
     106 and SFAS 112 to have a material effect on results of continuing
     operations exclusive of cumulative effects of changes in accounting
     principles.

     (n) Income Taxes:  The Company and its domestic subsidiaries, other
         ------------
     than (i) Phlcorp and its subsidiaries prior to January 1, 1993 and
     (ii) the life insurance subsidiaries of Colonial Penn (acquired in
     1991, as described below), file a consolidated federal income tax
     return.  Prior to January 1, 1993, Phlcorp filed a consolidated
     federal income tax return with its subsidiaries that are not life
     insurance companies.  The life insurance subsidiaries of Colonial Penn
     file separate or consolidated federal income tax returns.  In
     addition, certain subsidiaries are subject to foreign income taxes.

     The Company provides for income taxes using the liability method. 
     Effective as of January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 109.  Prior
     to adoption of SFAS 109, the benefit from utilization of tax loss
     carryforwards and future deductions was only recognized when utilized
     and under certain other limited circumstances.  Under SFAS 109, the
     future benefit of certain tax loss carryforwards and future deductions
     is recorded as an asset (net of valuation allowance) and the provision
     for income taxes for periods ending after December 31, 1992 is not
     reduced for the benefit from utilization of tax loss carryforwards. 
     Accordingly, the provision for income taxes for periods ended in 1993
     is not comparable to provisions for income taxes for periods ended in
     1992 and 1991.  Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are
     provided at the statutorily enacted rates for differences between the
     tax and accounting bases of substantially all assets and liabilities
     and for carryforwards.  A valuation allowance is provided (and
     periodically reevaluated) if deferred tax assets are not considered
     more likely than not to be realized.

     (o) Translation of Foreign Currency:  Foreign currency denominated
         -------------------------------
     investments which are not subject to hedging agreements and currency
     rate swap agreements not meeting the accounting requirements for
     "hedges," are converted into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect
     at the end of the period.  Resulting net exchange gains or losses were
     not material.

<PAGE>
     2.  Acquisitions:
         ------------

     Through November 1991, the Company owned approximately 66% of the
     outstanding common shares of Phlcorp.  During 1991 outstanding
     warrants to acquire approximately 8% of Phlcorp's shares were
     exercised by other parties at an aggregate purchase price of
     approximately $14,782,000.  After giving effect to certain purchases
     by the Company, the Company owned approximately 63% of Phlcorp's
     outstanding common shares at December 31, 1991 and throughout most of
     1992.  On December 31, 1992, pursuant to a merger agreement, Phlcorp
     merged with a subsidiary of the Company and became a wholly owned
     subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger").  Pursuant to the terms of
     the Merger, the Company issued .812 of a Common Share for each Phlcorp
     share not held by the Company or its subsidiaries (an aggregate of
     approximately 4,408,000 of the Company's  Common Shares).  The
     aggregate cost of acquiring the Phlcorp Minority Interest (principally
     based

     on the market price of the Company's Common Shares on the day
     immediately prior to entering into an agreement in principle as to the
     terms of the transaction) was approximately $142,927,000.

     The Company is a partner in The Jordan Company and Jordan/Zalaznick
     Capital Company, private investment firms whose principal activity is
     structuring leveraged buy-outs in which the partners are given the
     opportunity to become equity participants.  John W. Jordan II, a
     director of the Company and a significant shareholder, is a Managing
     Partner of both firms.  Since 1982, through such partnerships, the
     Company acquired interests in several companies (the "Jordan
     Associated Companies"), principally engaged in various aspects of
     manufacturing and distribution.  The Company currently accounts for
     its interests in fourteen of the Jordan Associated Companies on the
     cost method of accounting and one company (which is not material to
     the Company) on the equity method of accounting.  The investments
     acquired as a result of the partnership interests are considered
     Associated Companies.

     On August 16, 1991, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary,
     Charter National Life Insurance Company ("Charter National"),
     completed the acquisition of Colonial Penn for an aggregate cash
     purchase price of approximately $128,000,000, including costs.  The
     Company also made a subsequent $40,000,000 investment in Colonial
     Penn's principal property and casualty insurance subsidiary.  Colonial
     Penn is a holding company, principally for life and property and
     casualty insurance companies specializing in direct marketing of
     personal lines of insurance primarily to individuals over the age of
     50.  Colonial Penn's principal property and casualty insurance
     subsidiary also previously wrote certain commercial property and
     casualty insurance.

     At the acquisition date, after giving effect to a cash contribution by
     the seller prior to the closing of approximately $49,827,000, Colonial
     Penn had (unaudited) shareholder's equity, determined in accordance
     with generally accepted accounting principles, of approximately
     $391,000,000 (approximately $263,000,000 in excess of the purchase
     price).  The allocation of the purchase price reflected the
     elimination of deferred policy acquisition costs, value of insurance
     in force and property and equipment, and additional amounts for
     employee severance, postretirement benefits, relocation, lease
     commitments, restructuring costs and additional reserves for
     policyholders' benefits.  Colonial Penn is included in results of
     operations from its date of acquisition, August 16, 1991.

     For the period from date of acquisition to December 31, 1991, Colonial
     Penn had revenues of approximately $359,088,000 (including net
     security gains of approximately $16,323,000) and contributed
     approximately $59,995,000 to consolidated pre-tax income (exclusive of
     financing costs).  For the year ended December 31, 1992, Colonial Penn
     had revenues of approximately $836,552,000 (including net security
     gains of approximately $23,543,000) and contributed approximately
     $131,757,000 to consolidated pre-tax income (exclusive of financing
     costs).  Due to changes in the Company's insurance operations, it is
     not practicable to provide meaningful comparable information for the
     acquired Colonial Penn operations for 1993.  The following table
     provides certain unaudited consolidated pro forma results of
     operations data assuming the acquisition of Colonial Penn and the
     Phlcorp Minority Interest had occurred on January 1, 1991.  (Amounts
     are in thousands, except per share amounts.)

     The principal pro forma adjustments related to Colonial Penn reflected
     in the data above consist of elimination and/or reduction of (i)
     amortization and depreciation of deferred policy acquisition costs,
     value of insurance in force, goodwill and fixed assets, (ii) rent
     expense applicable to excess facilities and, (iii) with respect to
     1991, income taxes.  Such pro forma data also provides for the cost of
     financing the acquisition.

     The effects of certain cost savings programs implemented by the
     Company since the acquisition of Colonial Penn are reflected only to
     the extent included in the consolidated historical results of
     operations.  The reduction in new business solicitation effort which
     has been accomplished by the Company since the acquisition was
     expected to, and has, resulted in a substantial reduction in new
     business and premium revenues.  Colonial Penn's annualized written
     premiums related to new business generated were approximately
     $24,563,000 for 1992 compared to $111,277,000 for 1991.  However, the
     effect on operating earnings of such reduction in new business
     solicitation efforts cannot be reasonably estimated and is not
     reflected in the pro forma data above.  Accordingly, such pro forma
     data should not necessarily be considered indicative of future results
     of operations or the results of operations that would have resulted if
     the acquisitions had actually occurred as reflected in the pro forma
     data.

     3.  Investments in Associated Companies:
         -----------------------------------

     The Company owns or held part interests in the following foreign power
     companies:  Compania de Alumbrado Electrico de San Salvador, S.A.
     ("CAESS"), Compania Boliviana de Energia Electrica, S.A. - Bolivian
     Power Company Limited ("Bolivian Power") and, through Canadian
     International Power Company Limited Liquidating Trust, The Barbados
     Light and Power Company Limited.

     In March 1993, in settlement of claims related to El Salvador's 1986 
     seizure of CAESS's assets, the Company received cash of approximately 
     $5,300,000 and approximately $12,000,000 principal amount of 6% U.S.
     dollar denominated El Salvador Government bonds due in instalments 
     through 1996.  The Company, which had an investment in CAESS of
     $8,188,000 at December 31, 1992, will recognize the gain on the cash
     basis.  Payments of principal and interest are being made in
     accordance with their terms.  Recognized gains in 1993 were not
     significant.  During 1994, the Company disposed of the bonds and will
     report a pre-tax gain of $8,458,000 in first quarter 1994 results of
     operations.

     During 1993 the Company sold 750,000 shares of Bolivian Power common
     stock in an underwritten public offering and realized a pre-tax gain
     of approximately $12,981,000, which is reflected in 1993 results of
     operations in the caption, "Investment and other income."  At December
     31, 1993, the Company owned 719,206 shares of Bolivian Power common
     stock.

     The Company believes that it ultimately will receive the stock of two
     WMAC Companies, which are the only additional companies expected to be
     returned to the Company with significant value.  However, the timing
     of such receipt is uncertain.  The Company estimates that the fair
     value to the Company of the net tangible assets yet to be received is
     approximately $32,800,000 in excess of their recorded cost at December
     31, 1993. 

     4.  Insurance Operations:
         --------------------

     SPWL and SPDA policies generally provide the policyholder with a
     declared rate of cash value increase for a specified initial period
     and subsequent annual rates as determined by the Company, generally
     subject to minimum rates; the policyholder is generally subject to
     early termination penalties designed to recover unamortized policy
     acquisition costs.

</TABLE>


     During 1992, the Company concluded that the profitability of its
     existing block of SPDA business was unlikely to achieve acceptable
     results in the future.  Accordingly, principally starting in the
     fourth quarter of 1992, the Company offered certain of its existing
     SPDA policyholders' the opportunity to exchange their policies for
     SPDA policies of an unrelated insurer and entered into a reinsurance
     agreement (which closed in stages in 1992 and 1993) to reinsure
     certain blocks of SPDA business with a second unrelated insurer.  As a
     result, during the fourth quarter of 1992, policies with an aggregate
     policyholders' account balance of approximately $196,648,000 were
     either terminated by the policyholder, transferred at the
     policyholder's request or transferred in a reinsurance transaction. 
     In the 1993 transactions, which involved reinsurance of policies with
     account balances of approximately $47,187,000 on the date of closing,
     there was no significant gain or loss.   

     The Company is maximizing the return on any remaining SPDA policies by
     reducing crediting rates to the minimum permitted.  As a result, the
     Company believes a substantial portion of the remaining SPDA
     policyholders will terminate their policies over a period of time.

     On June 23, 1993, the Company reinsured substantially all of its
     existing SPWL business with a subsidiary of John Hancock Mutual Life
     Insurance Company ("John Hancock").  In connection with the
     transaction, the Company realized a net pre-tax gain of approximately
     $16,700,000 during 1993.  Such net pre-tax gain consists of net gains
     on sales of investments sold in connection with the transaction
     (approximately $24,100,000), which are included in the caption "Net
     securities gains," reduced by a net loss of approximately $7,400,000
     (principally the write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs of
     approximately $26,900,000 less the premium received on the
     transaction) which is included in the caption "Provision for insurance
     losses and policy benefits."  Further, the Company may receive
     additional consideration based on the subsequent performance of this
     block of business.




                                    <PAGE>

     Under SFAS 113, for financial reporting purposes, the Company will
     reflect the policy liabilities assumed by John Hancock (in policy
     reserves), with an offsetting receivable from John Hancock of the
     same amount (in reinsurance receivable, net), until the Company is
     relieved of its legal obligation to the SPWL policyholders.  During
     1993, the Company was legally relieved of SPWL policy liabilities
     of approximately $200,096,000.

     During the three years ended December 31, 1993, the Company sold, at
     gains, substantial amounts of investments (including dispositions in
     connection with the actual or contemplated transfer of blocks of
     business) and, in certain cases, reinvested proceeds at the lower
     prevailing interest rates.  Since certain of these rates

     were lower than had previously been expected on certain fixed rate
     annuity policies, the Company provided additional reserves of
     approximately $6,800,000 in 1993, $2,700,000 in 1992 and $8,800,000 in
     1991.  In addition, because of the lower anticipated investment
     earnings, the Company also recalculated deferred policy acquisition
     costs and provided additional amounts for amortization of deferred
     policy acquisition costs of $2,100,000 in 1992.

     The amount deducted from insurance loss and policy reserves for
     reinsured risks was approximately $179,391,000 at December 31, 1992.

     December 31, 1993 and 1992, statutory surplus of approximately
     $288,800,000 and $122,000,000, respectively, related to property and
     casualty operations is included in the statutory surplus of the life
     insurance parent and the property and casualty insurance subsidiary,

     4.  Insurance Operations, continued:
         --------------------

     The Company's insurance subsidiaries are members of state insurance
     funds which provide certain protection to policyholders of insolvent
     insurers doing business in those states.  Due to insolvencies of
     certain insurers in recent years, the Company's insurance subsidiaries
     have been assessed certain amounts and are likely to be assessed
     additional amounts by the state insurance funds.  The Company has
     provided for all anticipated assessments and does not expect any
     additional assessments to have a material effect on results of
     operations.

     The Colonial Penn property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are
     subject to a possible rate "roll-back" refund on California insurance
     premiums for certain pre-acquisition years.  The amount of such
     roll-back refunds are to be determined by the California Insurance
     Commissioner.  The Company has not been notified of the amount, if
     any, of such roll-back refund.  Based on its operating results in the
     relevant years, the Company believes Colonial Penn should not be
     assessed for any roll-back refund and, if assessed a significant
     amount, intends to vigorously oppose such determination.  In addition,
     New Jersey's insurance laws require all automobile insurers to share
     in the losses of the successor (the "MTF") to its insurance pool for
     high risk drivers (the "JUA"), based on their depopulation share of
     the JUA, as set by New Jersey.  Although the amount of the MTF deficit
     has not yet been established, based on certain current estimates
     (which are subject to change) of the MTF deficit, Colonial Penn could
     be assessed approximately $11,100,000, which has been accrued.  For
     1993, voluntary automobile net earned premiums in California and New
     Jersey together represented approximately 10% of the Company's total
     property and casualty net earned premiums.

     (a) Contractual maturities of instalment loan receivables at December
     31, 1993 were as follows (in thousands):  1994 - $102,524; 1995 -
     $39,598; 1996 - $21,674; 1997 - $13,942 and 1998 and thereafter -
     $9,956.  Experience shows that a substantial portion of such notes
     will be repaid or renewed prior to contractual maturity.  Accordingly,
     the foregoing is not to be regarded as a forecast of future cash
     collections.

     (b) On June 1, 1993, Mr. Jordan delivered to the Company 224,175 of
     the Company's Common Shares valued at $8,294,000 (the maturity value
     of the zero coupon note, after reflecting certain prepayments) as
     payment in full of the zero coupon note.  The Common Shares were
     valued at $37.00 per share, the closing price of a Common Share on the
     New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on the last full trading day
     prior to the authorization by the Company's Board of Directors of the
     agreement.  Interest and other income recognized in connection with
     the note was $420,000 for 1993, $929,000 for 1992 and $819,000 for
     1991.

     During 1992, the Company sold substantially all of its consumer loan
     development offices (which offices had aggregate instalment loan
     receivables at the time of sale of approximately $68,500,000) and
     realized pre-tax gains of approximately $12,128,000 in connection with
     the sales.  Such gains are included in 1992 results of operations in
     the caption, "Investment and other income."

     Reinsurance receivables are net of allowance for doubtful accounts of
     approximately $83,825,000 and $43,799,000 at December 31, 1993 and
     1992, respectively.  Amounts due from reinsurers for 1993 were
     reclassified in accordance with SFAS 113 resulting in the apparent
     increase in the allowance for doubtful reinsurance receivables.  Had
     the prior accounting been in effect, reinsurance receivables would
     have been reduced by approximately $457,621,000 at December 31, 1993. 
     At December 31, 1993, reinsurance receivables, net includes
     approximately $322,351,000 due from a subsidiary of John Hancock.

     Credit agreements provide for aggregate contractual credit facilities
     of $150,000,000 at December 31, 1993 and bear interest based on the
     prime rate or LIBOR, plus commitment and other fees.  Such credit
     facilities were renewed in 1994 to expire in 1997.

     Approximately $16,717,000 of the manufacturing division's net
     property, equipment and leasehold improvements are pledged as
     collateral for the Industrial Revenue Bonds; and approximately
     $2,727,000 of other property is pledged for other indebtedness
     aggregating approximately $1,171,000.

     The Company has interest rate swap agreements with a bank which expire
     in 1996, the practical effect of which is to convert the variable
     interest rate on $50,000,000 of indebtedness into fixed interest rate
     obligations at an interest rate of approximately 8%.  

     During 1989, the Company entered into long-term hedging transactions
     whereby substantially all currency rate risk related to the Swiss
     Franc Bonds for their remaining term was eliminated and the cost of
     which increased the cost of the issue to approximately 10.4%.

     In February 1993, the Company sold $100,000,000 principal amount of
     its newly authorized 5 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due
     2003 (the "Convertible Debentures") in an underwritten public
     offering.  The Convertible Debentures are convertible into Common
     Shares at $57.50 per Common Share (an aggregate of 1,739,130 Common
     Shares), subject to anti-dilution provisions.

     In August 1993, the Company sold $100,000,000 principal amount of its
     newly authorized 7 3/4% Senior Notes due 2013 (at 99% of principal
     amount) in an underwritten public offering.

     The most restrictive of the Company's debt instruments requires
     maintenance of minimum Tangible Net Worth, as defined, and limit
     Indebtedness, as defined, to a percentage of Tangible Net Worth and

         --------------------------------

     Indebtedness, as defined.  In addition, the debt instruments contain
     limitations on dividends, investments, liens, contingent obligations
     and certain other matters.  As of January 1, 1994, cash dividends of
     approximately $180,600,000 could be paid under the most restrictive
     covenants.

     The aggregate annual mandatory redemptions of debt during the five
     year period ending December 31, 1998 (exclusive of Credit Agreements)
     are as follows (in thousands):  1994 - $28,821; 1995 - $3,013; 1996 -
     $35,246; 1997 - $1,017; and, 1998 - $872.

     10.  Common Shares, Stock Options, Warrants and Preferred Shares:
          -----------------------------------------------------------

     On July 14, 1993, the shareholders approved an increase in authorized
     Common Shares from 60,000,000 to 150,000,000.

     The Board of Directors from time to time has authorized acquisitions
     of the Company's Common Shares.  Pursuant to such authorization,
     during the three year period ended December 31, 1993, the Company
     acquired 496,031 Common Shares (282,409 in 1993, 110,800 shares in
     1992 and 102,822 shares in 1991) at an average price of $30.26 per
     Common Share.  The Common Shares acquired in 1993, include 224,175
     Common Shares acquired from John W. Jordan II.

     As a result of the realization of significant gains on sales of
     securities (including dispositions in connection with the termination
     or transfer of SPDA and SPWL business) and reinvestment of the
     proceeds of certain dispositions at the lower prevailing interest
     rates, the Company recalculated or eliminated deferred policy
     acquisition costs applicable to the IOP products and provided
     additional amounts for policyholder benefits applicable to certain
     fixed rate products as indicated above. 

     Proceeds from sales of fixed maturity investments (including
     securities held for sale) were approximately $1,171,574,000,
     $2,421,057,000 and $1,016,645,000 during 1993, 1992 and 1991,
     respectively.  Gross gains of approximately $51,839,000, $70,551,000
     and $50,797,000 and gross losses (including provisions for
     write-downs) of approximately $3,587,000, $24,501,000 and $23,677,000
     were realized on those sales during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

     The valuation allowance principally relates to certain acquired tax
     loss carryforwards, the usage of which is subject to certain
     limitations and certain other matters which may restrict the
     availability of reported tax loss carryforwards.  In addition, the
     amounts reflected above are based on the minimum tax loss
     carryforwards of Phlcorp and assume that certain proposed regulations
     affecting the use of Phlcorp's tax loss carryforwards are finalized
     without significant change.  As described more fully herein,
     substantial additional amounts may be available under certain
     circumstances.

     The Company believes it is more likely than not that the recorded
     deferred tax asset will be realized; such realization will principally
     result from taxable income generated by profitable operations.

     The provision for income taxes for 1993 only was calculated under
     SFAS 109.  Accordingly, the provisions for periods ended in 1993 are
     not comparable to provisions for periods ended prior to 1993.

     In August 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (the "OBRA") was
     enacted which, among other things, increased certain corporate income
     tax rates retroactive to the beginning of 1993.  Under SFAS 109,
     deferred income taxes are calculated at the statutory rates scheduled
     to be in effect when the tax benefit is estimated to be realized. 
     When changes in statutory income tax rates are enacted, current and
     deferred income taxes are recalculated and any resulting adjustment is
     reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which
     such legislation is enacted.

     The valuation allowance applicable to the deferred income tax asset
     recorded upon adoption of SFAS 109 gave effect to the possible
     unavailability of certain income tax deductions.  During the third
     quarter of 1993 certain matters were resolved and the Company reduced
     the valuation allowance, resulting in a reduction in the provision for
     income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1993.

     The Company estimates that if SFAS 109 had not been adopted, the
     provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1993 would
     have been lower by, and net income (exclusive of amounts applicable to
     changes in accounting principles) would have been higher by,
     approximately $42,614,000 (or $1.46 per primary earnings per share and
     $1.38 per fully diluted earnings per share).

     As previously noted, the Company, certain of the Colonial Penn life
     insurance subsidiaries and Phlcorp prior to 1993 filed consolidated
     federal income tax returns with certain subsidiaries (including, with
     respect to Phlcorp, the WMAC Companies).  Phlcorp is included in the
     Company's consolidated income tax return in 1993.

     Phlcorp, in connection with its 1986 reorganization, entered into a
     tax settlement agreement (the "Tax Settlement Agreement") with the
     United States whereby, among other things, Phlcorp agreed that upon
     utilization of certain pre-reorganization tax loss carryforwards, it
     would pay 25% of any resultant tax savings to the government, subject
     to certain limitations.  The Tax Settlement Agreement provides that
     the amount of pre-reorganization operating loss carryforwards will be
     calculated by a method which, among other things, gives

     consideration to the outcome of certain ruling requests made by
     Phlcorp and provides that post-reorganization net operating losses
     will be utilized prior to pre-reorganization operating losses in
     calculating tax sharing payments.  In 1991, the Internal Revenue
     Service ("IRS") issued a favorable ruling on certain rulings requested
     by Phlcorp.  This ruling did not address all matters and, therefore,
     certain matters remain unresolved.  In addition, in the past, the IRS
     has indicated that it disagrees with Phlcorp's reporting positions on
     certain post-reorganization deductions and has suggested that such
     positions violate the Tax Settlement Agreement.  Because of these
     uncertainties, Phlcorp is unable to state with certainty the amount of
     its available carryforwards.  However, Phlcorp believes that it has
     minimum tax operating loss carryforwards of between $143,000,000 and
     $302,000,000 at December 31, 1993.  The expiration dates for Phlcorp's
     carryforwards will depend on the outcome of the matters referred to
     above, although it is unlikely such carryforwards will begin to expire
     before 1998.

     At December 31, 1993 the Company had loss carryforwards for income tax
     purposes as follows (in thousands):

     Limitations exist under the tax law which may restrict the utilization
     of the Phlcorp carryforwards subsequent to December 31, 1993 and an
     aggregate of approximately $25,000,000 of non-Phlcorp tax loss
     carryforwards.  Further, certain of the future deductions may only be
     utilized in the tax returns of certain life insurance subsidiaries. 
     These limitations were considered when providing the valuation
     allowance under SFAS 109.

     Under certain circumstances, the value of the carryforwards available
     could be substantially reduced if certain changes in ownership were to
     occur.  In order to reduce this possibility, the Company's
     shareholders at a special meeting held on December 30, 1992, approved
     certain charter restrictions which prohibit transfers of the Company's
     Common Stock under certain circumstances.

     Under prior law, Charter National had accumulated approximately
     $19,561,000 of special federal income tax deductions allowed life
     insurance companies as of December 31, 1993 and the Colonial Penn life
     insurance subsidiaries had accumulated approximately $161,000,000 of
     such special deductions.  Under certain conditions, such amounts could
     become taxable in future periods.  Except with respect to amounts
     applicable to Colonial Penn's life insurance subsidiaries for which
     the seller has assumed such liability contractually, the Company does
     not anticipate any transaction occurring which would cause these
     amounts to become taxable.  In connection with the IRS's examination

     Penn life insurance companies, the IRS has asserted that approximately
     $93,025,000 of special federal income tax deductions allowed life
     insurance companies should have been reflected in taxable income in
     1986, resulting in a tax (exclusive of interest and penalties) of
     approximately $42,792,000.  As noted above, the seller is
     contractually liable for any such taxes (including interest and
     penalties).  The seller has contested the IRS assessment.

     The plans' assets consist primarily of fixed income securities
     (principally U.S. government and agencies' bonds).

     The projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 and 1992 was
     determined using an assumed discount rate of 7.0% and 7.5%,
     respectively, and an assumed compensation increase rate of 5.9% and
     6.6%, respectively.  The assumed long-term rate of return on plan
     assets was 7.3% and 7.5% at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

     The Company also has defined contribution pension plans covering
     certain employees.  Contributions and costs are a percent of each
     covered employee's salary.  Amounts charged to expense related to such
     plans were $2,066,000, $2,106,000 and $2,491,000 for the years ended
     December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

     14.  Pension Plans and Other Postemployment and Postretirement
          ---------------------------------------------------------
     Benefits, continued:
     --------

     Several subsidiaries provide certain health care and other benefits to
     certain retired employees.  The costs of such benefits prior to
     January 1, 1993 were expensed generally as incurred, although
     liabilities for benefits were recorded in connection with certain
     acquisitions, including that of Colonial Penn and the Phlcorp Minority
     Interest.  SFAS 106 and SFAS 112  require companies to accrue the cost
     of providing certain postretirement and postemployment benefits during
     the employee's period of service.  Amounts charged to expense related
     to such benefits were $2,594,000 in 1993 (principally interest),
     $1,527,000 in 1992 and $1,256,000 in 1991.

     The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1993
     is as follows (in thousands):

  </TABLE>

     The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement
     benefit obligation was 7.0% at December 31, 1993.  The assumed health
     care cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated postretirement
     benefit obligation were between approximately 8% and 15% for 1993
     declining to an ultimate rate of between 5% and 8% by 2006.

     If the health care cost trend rates were increased by 1%, the
     accumulated postretirement obligation as of December 31, 1993 would
     have increased by approximately $1,404,000.  The effect of this change
     on the estimated aggregate of service and interest cost for 1993 would
     be immaterial.

     The Company and its subsidiaries rent office space and office
     equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with terms generally
     varying from one to fifteen years.  Rental expense (net of sublease
     rental income) charged to operations was approximately $17,555,000 in
     1993, $20,791,000 in 1992 and $13,934,000 in 1991.  Aggregate minimum
     annual rentals (exclusive of real estate taxes, maintenance and

     In addition, certain of the WMAC Companies that have been returned to
     the control of the Company have guaranteed the adequacy of certain
     other matters.  The maximum amount of such contingencies is
     approximately $5,000,000 at December 31, 1993.  The Company does not
     expect a material loss in connection with these guarantees.

     The insurance subsidiaries and the banking subsidiaries are limited by
     regulatory requirements and agreements in the amount of dividends and
     other transfers of funds that are available to the Company. 
     Principally as a result of such restrictions, the net assets of
     subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to
     the Company were approximately $735,000,000 at December 31, 1993.

     16.  Litigation:
          ----------
     The Company is subject to various litigation which arises in the
     course of its business.  Based on discussions with counsel, management
     is of the opinion that such litigation will have no material adverse
     effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company or its
     consolidated results of operations.

     17.  Earnings Per Common Share:
          -------------------------
     Earnings per common and dilutive common equivalent share was
     calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average
     number of Common Shares outstanding and the incremental weighted
     average number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of warrants for
     the periods they were outstanding.  The number of common and dilutive
     common equivalent shares used for this calculation was 29,270,000 in
     1993, 24,435,000 in 1992 and 23,704,000 in 1991.

     Fully diluted earnings per share was calculated as described above
     except that in 1992 the incremental number of shares utilized the year
     end market price for the Company's Common Shares, since the year end
     market price was above the average for the year.  In addition, in
     1993, the calculations assume the Convertible Debentures had been
     converted into Common Shares for the period they were outstanding and
     earnings increased for the interest on such debentures, net of the
     income tax effect.  The number of shares used for this calculation was
     30,743,000 in 1993, 24,516,000 in 1992 and 23,916,000 in 1991.

     18.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
          -----------------------------------

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures
     about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" ("SFAS 107"), requires
     disclosure of fair value information about certain financial
     instruments, whether or not recognized on the balance sheet.  Where
     quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
     estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.  Those
     techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used,
     including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.  In
     addition, SFAS 107 excludes certain financial instruments and all
     non-financial instruments from its disclosure requirements. 
     Therefore, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not purport
     to represent and should not be considered representative of the
     underlying "market" or franchise value of the Company.  The methods
     and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of each class of the
     financial instruments described below are as follows:

     (a)  Investments:  The fair values of marketable equity securities and
     fixed maturity securities are substantially based on quoted market
     prices, as disclosed in Note 5.  It is not practicable to determine
     the fair value of policyholder loans since such loans generally have
     no stated maturity, are not separately transferable and are often
     repaid by reductions to benefits and surrenders.

     (b)  Cash and short-term investments:  For short-term investments, the
     carrying amount approximates fair value.

<PAGE>

     18.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments, continued:
          -----------------------------------

     (c)  Loans receivable of banking and lending subsidiaries:  The fair
     value of loans receivable of the banking and lending subsidiaries is
     estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates
     at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit
     ratings for the same remaining maturities.

     (d)  El Salvador Government bonds receivable, net of deferred gain: 
     The fair value of the bonds receivable at December 31, 1993 is based
     on estimated market prices.

     (e)  Separate and variable accounts:  Separate and variable accounts
     assets and liabilities are carried at market value, which is a
     reasonable estimate of fair value.

     (f)  Investments in Associated Companies:  The fair values of certain
     foreign power companies are principally estimated based upon quoted
     market prices.  The fair value of CAESS at December 31, 1992 was
     estimated based upon the agreement with the government of El Salvador
     as to the amounts to be paid to the Company for the assets which were
     seized by the government.

     The carrying value of the remaining investments in associated
     companies approximates fair value.

     (g)  The WMAC Companies:  The fair value of the WMAC Companies is
     estimated based upon the Company's assessment of the fair value of
     their underlying net tangible assets to be received.

     (h)  Customer banking deposits:  The fair value of customer banking
     deposits is estimated using rates currently offered for deposits of
     similar remaining maturities.

     (i)  Long-term and other indebtedness:  The fair values of
     non-variable rate debt are estimated using quoted market prices,
     estimated rates which would be available to the Company for debt with
     similar terms and, with respect to the Swiss Franc Bonds, the cost to
     terminate the currency and interest rate hedging agreement.  The fair
     value of variable rate debt is estimated to be the carrying amount.

     (j)  Investment contract reserves:  SPDA reserves are carried at
     account value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value.  The fair
     value of other investment contracts is estimated by discounting the
     future payments at rates which would currently be offered for
     contracts with similar terms.

     During 1991, settlement of certain litigation related to Cambrian &
     General, a subsidiary, was approved and, accordingly, reserves which
     were no longer required were eliminated.  In addition, payments on
     certain investments, which were carried at no value, were received in
     that year.  As a result, during 1991, the Company recognized income of
     approximately $9,359,000.

     20.  Other Results of Operations Information, continued:
          ---------------------------------------

     Taxes, other than income or payroll, included in operations amounted
     to approximately $36,839,000 (including $21,295,000 of premium taxes)
     for the year ended December 31, 1993, $35,051,000 (including
     $21,153,000 of premium taxes) for the year ended December 31, 1992 and
     $19,627,000 (including $9,321,000 of premium taxes) for the year ended
     December 31, 1991.

     Advertising costs amounted to approximately $10,394,000, $9,578,000
     and $10,623,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
     respectively.

     Research and development costs, principally applicable to development
     of a database marketing program by the trading stamp subsidiary prior
     to 1992, approximated $8,928,000 in 1991 and were not material in 1992
     and 1993.  During 1991, the Company decided to discontinue development
     of the database marketing program.  Accordingly, amounts for 1991
     include shutdown costs.

     21.   Subsequent Event:
           ----------------
     During the first quarter of 1994, the Company and an equal partner
     agreed to acquire a 60% interest in Caja de Ahorro y Seguro S.A.
     ("Caja") for a purchase price of approximately $85,000,000, subject to
     final adjustment.  Caja is a holding company whose subsidiaries are
     engaged in property and casualty insurance, life insurance and banking
     in Argentina.  Caja has (unaudited) assets in excess of approximately
     $500,000,000.  Reliable historical operating data for Caja is not

<FN>
      (1)         The weighted average interest rates do not necessarily represent the
                  financial statement impact of short-term borrowings since the Company's
                  "interest rate swap" agreements have the practical effect of converting
                  borrowings under short-term arrangements to a fixed borrowing rate (see
                  Note 9).

      (2)         The average amount outstanding is the average of the daily balances
                  except for customer banking deposits which are based on month-end
                  balances; the maximum amount outstanding is based on the month-end which
                  had the highest aggregate balance.

     Corporation as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and also agrees to

     as may be designated by the Corporation, faithfully, diligently and to
     the best of his ability, under the direction of the Board of Directors
     of the Corporation and of such subsidiary and affiliated companies,
     devoting his time, energy and skill to such employment, and to perform

     except that Executive may devote time to his personal investments so
     long as the same does not interfere with the performance of his duties

     year, if any, during the period of Executive's employment hereunder
     shall have increased over the average cost of living during the year
     ending June 30, 1994, (determined on a cumulative basis), then the
     $500,000 base rate of compensation referred to above (as from time to
     time increased pursuant to this Subparagraph) shall be increased
     prospectively effective that July 1 to reflect a percentage increase
     equal to the increase in the average cost of living.

               5.   Other Benefits.

     expenses as may be reasonably requested by the Corporation.

                    (c)  It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto
     that during the term of Executive's employment hereunder, he shall be

     full-time employee of the Corporation during the Severance Period.

                    (e)  During the Severance Period, the Corporation or
     its successors shall maintain, in full force and effect, term life

     Agreements") the effect of which was to accelerate the taxation and
     deductibility of bonus payments otherwise expected to be paid by LI to
     Executive within the five year period commencing January 1, 1993; and

          WHEREAS, federal tax law changes, in fact, have been implemented
     which will increase the cost of compensation to both Employer and its
     employees beginning in 1994; and

          WHEREAS, to address these developments Employer and Executive
     desire to accelerate the taxation and deductibility of bonus payments
     otherwise expected to be paid by Employer to Executive within the five
     year period commencing January 1, 1998; and

          WHEREAS, contemporaneously herewith Executive and Employer have
     entered in an Escrow and Security agreement (the "Escrow and Security
     Agreement") of even date herewith; and

          WHEREAS, Employer and Joseph S. Steinberg (Mr. Steinberg,
     together with Executive, collectively, the "Executives"), have entered
     into an Agreement identical to this Agreement and an escrow and
     security agreement identical to the Escrow and Security Agreement.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good
     and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
     hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties
     hereto agree as follows:

          SECTION ONE.  ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION.
          -------------------------------------
          The Employer hereby agrees to pay to (or for the benefit of)
     Executive, as additional compensation, the sum of $4,000,000 (the
     "Fund Amount"), upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

          SECTION TWO.  VESTING IN GENERAL.
          --------------------------------
          Subject to clause (b) of Section Four hereof, Executive's right
     to receive the Fund Amount shall vest at the rate of 20% for each full
     calendar year after December 31, 1997 during which Executive continues
     in the employ of Employer or any of its subsidiaries (collectively,
     the "Employer Group").  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
     Executive's right to receive the Fund Amount shall be 50% vested if
     Executive dies or becomes disabled (as defined in Section 7 of the
     Employment Agreement) prior to December 31, 2000 and shall be 100%
     vested if (i) Executive is terminated by Employer without cause (as
     defined in Section 8 (a)(i) of the Employment Agreement), (ii) an
     Initiating Event (as defined in Annex A hereto) occurs, or (iii)
     Employer becomes subject to the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy or
     similar court in the context of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
     proceeding.  

          For purposes of this Agreement, any portion of the Fund Amount
     vested pursuant to this Section Two or pursuant to Section Four hereof
     shall be referred to as the "Vested Amount."

          SECTION THREE.  PAYMENT IN GENERAL.
          ----------------------------------

          (a)  General -- Except as otherwise provided in this Section
               -------
     Three, on January 1, 2003 the Vested Amount as of such date shall be
     paid by Employer to Executive.

          (b)  Payment Upon Termination -- Except as otherwise provided in
               ------------------------
     this Section Three, in the event that Executive's employment with the
     Employer Group terminates prior to January 1, 2003, promptly after the
     date of such termination Employer shall pay to Executive the Vested
     Amount as of the date of such termination.

          (c)  Early Payments -- Pursuant to Section Four and Section Seven
               --------------
     hereof, payments of the Fund Amount may be made to or on behalf of
     Executive prior to January 1, 2003 ("Early Payments").  For purposes
     hereof, the term "Available Fund Amount" shall mean, as of any date,
     an amount equal to the Fund Amount reduced by all Early Payments made
     prior to such date.  If any Early Payment shall have been made, any
     amount required to be paid by Employer to Executive pursuant to clause
     (a) or (b) of this Section Three shall be reduced by the sum of all
     such Early Payments.  To the extent that the sum of all Early Payments
     exceeds the Vested Amount on the earlier of January 1, 2003 or the
     date on which Executive's employment with the Employer Group
     terminates, Executive shall be obligated promptly to pay to Employer
     the amount of such deficiency, plus interest accruing at the prime
     rate, as announced from time to time by Citibank, N.A., compounded
     annually on the amount of the deficiency from the date hereof through
     the date on which Executive makes a payment to Employer pursuant to
     this clause (c).

          SECTION FOUR.  ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT/VESTING.
          ----------------------------------------------

          (a)  Accelerated Payment -- In the sole discretion of the Board
               -------------------
     of Directors of Employer, excluding Executives, upon recommendation of
     the Compensation Committee of Employer, Employer may accelerate
     payment to Executive of all or a portion of the Available Fund Amount. 
     In determining whether or not to accelerate payment of all or any
     portion of the Available Fund Amount, the Board of Directors of
     Employer and the Compensation Committee thereof may consider, among
     other things, the then applicable tax law and the costs and benefits
     to the Employer Group, under the tax law, this Agreement, the Escrow
     and Security Agreement, the 1992 Agreements and otherwise, of
     effecting such acceleration.
























<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

          (b)  Accelerated Vesting -- In the event of any accelerated
               -------------------
     payment pursuant to clause (a) of this Section Four, for all purposes
     hereof the Vested Amount shall equal the greater of (i) the Vested
     Amount computed pursuant to Section Two hereof without regard to this
     Section Four, or (ii) the sum of all payments made pursuant to clause
     (a) of this Section Four, plus an amount equal to the product of the
     Withheld Amount (defined below), if any, and a fraction the numerator
     of which is the sum of all amounts paid pursuant to clause (a) of
     Section Four hereof and the denominator of which is the Fund Amount.

          SECTION FIVE.  ESCROW ARRANGEMENT.
          ---------------------------------
          The obligations of Employer to Executive hereunder shall be
     implemented and secured by way of the Escrow and Security Agreement. 
     Toward that end, any payment obligation of Employer hereunder shall be
     satisfied, to the extent possible, by directing a release from the
     Escrow Amount (as defined in the Escrow and Security Agreement) of the
     appropriate amount to be paid to the Executive.  Such Escrow and
     Security Agreement shall be irrevocable and is intended by the parties
     to secure Employer's obligations to Executive hereunder, and to
     implement such obligations.  As provided in the Escrow and Security
     Agreement, the escrow agent shall be Weil, Gotshal and Manges, the
     investment of the escrow funds shall be directed by the Chief
     Financial Officer of the Employer, the income and earnings realized in
     respect of the escrow fund shall be distributed promptly to Employer,
     and the tax responsibility for such income and earnings shall be borne
     by Employer.

          SECTION SIX. -- TAX ELECTION.
          ----------------------------
          Executive shall timely and properly file an election under
     Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in
     respect of his receipt, as compensation, of this Agreement and his
     interest in the escrow established pursuant to the Escrow and Security
     Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
     Executive's failure timely and properly to file such tax election
     shall result in the immediate termination of Employer's obligations
     hereunder and in a termination of the Escrow and Security Agreement,
     and an immediate return to Employer of the escrowed funds deposited by
     Employer pursuant to such Agreement.

          SECTION SEVEN. -- TAX WITHHOLDING.
          ---------------------------------
          Executive agrees that Employer and/or its subsidiaries or
     affiliates shall effect all required tax withholdings in respect



























<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     of the additional compensation paid pursuant to this Agreement.  At
     Executive's election, $1,912,000 (the "Withheld Amount") of the Fund
     Amount shall be applied by the Employer in satisfaction of its
     withholding obligations.  If Executive makes such election, the Escrow
     Agent (as defined in the Escrow and Security Agreement) shall be
     directed to release the Withheld Amount to Employer.  Notwithstanding
     such election, the Withheld Amount shall remain unvested except as
     otherwise provided in Section Two and Section Four hereof.

          SECTION EIGHT. -- AFFECT ON OTHER AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS.
          -------------------------------------------------------------
          This Agreement shall have no affect on the rights and obligations
     of the parties hereto under any other agreement.  Notwithstanding this
     Agreement, the Board of Directors of Employer, excluding Executives,
     upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee of Employer,
     annually will determine the amount, if any, of bonuses to be paid to
     Executive.  In determining the amount of any such bonus, the Board of
     Directors of Employer and the Compensation Committee thereof will
     consider the costs and benefits to Employer of implementing this
     Agreement, which shall include consideration of changes in the tax
     law, if any.

          SECTION NINE. -- ASSIGNABILITY AND BINDING EFFECT.
          -------------------------------------------------
          This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding
     upon the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and legal
     representatives of Executive, and shall inure to the benefit of and be
     binding upon the Employer and its successors, but the obligations of
     Executive hereunder may not be assigned to another person, firm or
     corporation nor may they be delegated.

     parties with respect to the compensation arrangement described herein,

          SECTION ELEVEN. -- SEVERABILITY.

          If any provision of this Agreement or any part hereof is invalid,
     unlawful or incapable of being enforced, by reason of any rule of law

     unenforceable provision shall, nevertheless, remain in full force and

     conditions of this Agreement.

          SECTION THIRTEEN. -- GOVERNING LAW.
          ----------------------------------

                         ESCROW AND SECURITY AGREEMENT 


               ESCROW AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, dated as of December 28,
     1993, by and among LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION, a New York
     corporation ("Employer"), Ian M. Cumming ("Executive") and Weil,
     Gotshal and Manges (a partnership including professional corporations)
     ("Escrow Agent").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:


               WHEREAS, pursuant to an agreement made as of the 12th day of
     March 1984 between Employer's subsidiary, Leucadia, Inc. ("LI") and
     Executive (the "Employment Agreement"), Executive is employed as
     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Employer; and 

               WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement,
     Executive serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to such of
     Employer's subsidiaries and affiliates as Employer may designate,
     including LI; and 

               WHEREAS, the Employment Agreement expires June 30, 1994; and

               WHEREAS, Employer and Executive have agreed to enter into a
     new employment agreement expiring June 30, 2003; and

               WHEREAS, in 1992, in anticipation of changes to the tax
     laws, LI and Executive entered into certain agreements (collectively,
     the "1992 Agreements") the effect of which was to accelerate the
     taxation and deductibility of bonus payments otherwise expected to be
     paid by Employer or LI to Executive within the five years period
     commencing January 1, 1993; and

               WHEREAS, federal tax law changes, in fact, have been
     implemented which will increase the cost of compensation to both
     Employer and its employees beginning in 1994; and

               WHEREAS, to address these developments, Employer and
     Executive have entered into an Agreement dated December 28, 1993
     providing for the establishment of an executive compensation
     arrangement for the benefit of Executive, a copy of which is attached
     hereto as Exhibit A (the "Compensation Agreement"); and

























<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

               WHEREAS, the Compensation Agreement provides for the deposit
     by Employer of $4.0 million (the "Fund Amount") into an escrow account
     (the "Escrow Account") and the release of such funds in accordance
     with the provision of Section 4 hereof; and

               WHEREAS, contemporaneously herewith Employer and Joseph S.
     Steinberg (Mr. Steinberg, together with Executive, collectively, the
     "Executives") have entered into an agreement identical to the
     Compensation Agreement; and 

               WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent is willing to serve as Escrow
     Agent and hold the Fund Amount, plus any interest earned thereon (the
     "Escrowed Property") in accordance with and subject to the terms and
     conditions hereof.

               NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other
     good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
     is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties
     hereto agree as follows:

               1.   Employer and Executive hereby consent to the
     appointment of and hereby appoint Weil, Gotshal & Manges as Escrow
     Agent, to serve as escrow agent in accordance with the terms and
     conditions herein set forth, and Escrow Agent hereby accepts such
     appointment.  

               2.   Security Interest.  The parties hereto agree that the
                    -----------------
     Fund Amount is intended to secure any and all liabilities of Employer
     to Executive under the Compensation Agreement.  Employer hereby grants
     to Employee an irrevocable security interest in the Fund Amount and
     the parties hereto agree that the Fund Amount (i) shall be received
     and held by Escrow Agent for the benefit of Employee and to protect
     the interest of Employee in the Fund Amount, and (ii) shall be
     disbursed by Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms hereof.

               3.   The Fund Amount shall be deposited with Escrow Agent as
     follows:

               (a)  On the date hereof, Employer shall deliver to Escrow
     Agent the Fund Amount.  Escrow Agent shall not be liable or
     responsible for the collection of the proceeds of any check payable or
     endorsed to Escrow Agent hereunder.

               (b)  Escrow Agent shall, in accordance with direction
     provided by the Chief Financial Officer of the Employer, deposit the
     Fund Amount in certificates of deposit or interest bearing accounts of
     any bank or trust company, incorporated under the
























<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     laws of the United States of America or any state, which has combined
     capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000.

               (c)  All interest earned on the Fund Amount ("Interest")
     shall be the property of the Employer and shall not be added to or
     become part of the Escrow Amount (as defined).  All Interest shall be
     paid by the Escrow Agent, on a current basis, to Employer without the
     need for any further action on the part of Employer.

               (d)  The Fund Amount, as such may from time to time be
     decreased by the release of monies from the Fund Amount pursuant to
     the terms hereof, shall constitute the "Escrow Amount."

               4.  The Escrow Amount shall be released by the Escrow Agent
     as follows:

               (a)  Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of Disbursing
     Instructions in the form attached as Annex A hereto executed by both
     Executive and Employer (as evidenced by the signature of a majority of
     the members of Employer's Compensation Committee), Escrow Agent shall
     release to Executive so much of the Escrow Amount as indicated in the
     Disbursing Instructions; and

               (b)  Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of Disbursing
     Instructions in the form attached as Annex B hereto executed by both
     Executive and Employer (as evidenced by the signature of a majority of
     the members of Employer's Compensation Committee), Escrow Agent shall
     release to Employer so much of the Escrow Amount as indicated in the
     Disbursing Instructions

               5.  Any notice or certificate given to Escrow Agent under
     Section 4 shall be by hand or overnight delivery to the parties at the
     addresses set forth in Section 16 of this Agreement.  In the event of
     any dispute, Escrow Agent shall retain the Escrow Amount until the
     dispute is resolved by the final order or judgment of a court having
     jurisdiction with respect thereto.  Reasonable fees and costs of the
     other party or parties shall be advanced by the party giving notice of
     a dispute, and shall be borne by the party or parties not prevailing
     in the action.

               6.   Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
     be fully protected from all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense
     in acting or omitting to act pursuant to, any instruction, order,
     judgment, certification, affidavit, demand, notice, opinion,
     instrument or other writing delivered to it hereunder without being
     required to determine the authenticity of
























<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     such document, the correctness of any fact stated therein, the
     propriety of the service thereof or the capacity, identity or
     authority of any party purporting to sign or deliver such document.

               7.   The duties of Escrow Agent are only as herein
     specifically provided, and are purely ministerial in nature.  Escrow
     Agent shall neither be responsible for, or under, nor chargeable with
     knowledge of, the terms and conditions of any other agreement,
     instrument or document in connection herewith, including, without
     limitation, the agreements referred to in the preamble to this
     Agreement, and shall be required to act in respect of the Fund Amount
     and the Escrow Property only as provided in this Agreement.  This
     Agreement sets forth all the obligations of Escrow Agent with respect
     to any and all matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder
     and no additional obligations of Escrow Agent shall be implied from
     the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement.  Escrow Agent
     shall incur no liability in connection with the discharge of its
     obligations under this Agreement or otherwise in connection therewith,
     except such liability as may arise from the willful misconduct or
     gross negligence of Escrow Agent.

               8.   Escrow Agent may consult with counsel of its choice,
     which may include attorneys in the firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, and
     shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
     Escrow Agent in accordance with the advice of such counsel.

               9.   Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any modification,
     cancellation or rescission of this Agreement unless in writing and
     signed by Escrow Agent.

               10.  Escrow Agent shall have no tax reporting duties with
     respect to the Fund Amount, the Escrow Amount, the Escrowed Property
     or income thereon, such duties being the responsibility of the party
     or parties which receive, or have the right to receive, any taxable
     income hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Escrow Agent has the
     authority to comply with the provisions of Section 468B(g) of the
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations
     promulgated thereunder.  Such authority shall include, without limita-
     tion, (i) the filing of tax returns (including information returns)
     with respect to the Fund Amount, the Escrow Amount, the Escrowed
     Property or income thereon, (ii) the payment of any tax, interest or
     penalties imposed thereon, (iii) the withholding of any amounts which
     are required to be withheld and (iv) the payment over of such withheld
     amounts to the appropriate taxing authority.  The



























<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     parties to this Agreement, other than Escrow Agent, shall provide
     Escrow Agent with all information necessary to enable Escrow Agent to
     comply with the foregoing.  Escrow Agent may withdraw from the Fund
     Amount or the Escrow Amount amounts necessary to pay all applicable
     income or withholding taxes (plus interest and penalties thereon) that
     are required to be paid.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the Fund
     Amount and the Escrow Amount, excluding any Interest thereon, shall be
     the Executive's property unless and until disbursed to Employer
     pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof.

               11.   Escrow Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with
     respect to the Escrowed Property.  If any dispute arises as to whether
     Escrow Agent is obligated to deliver the Escrowed Property or as to
     whom the Escrowed Property is to be delivered or the amount thereof,
     Escrow Agent shall not be required to make any delivery, but in such
     event Escrow Agent may hold the Escrowed Property until receipt by
     Escrow Agent of instructions in writing, signed by all parties which
     have, or claim to have, an interest in the Escrowed Property,
     directing the disposition of the Escrowed Property, or in the absence
     of such authorization, Escrow Agent may hold the Escrowed Property
     until receipt of a certified copy of a final judgment of a court of
     competent jurisdiction providing for the disposition of the Escrowed
     Property.  Escrow Agent may require, as a condition to the disposition
     of the Escrowed Property pursuant to written instructions,
     indemnification and/or opinions of counsel, in form and substance
     satisfactory to Escrow Agent, from each party providing such
     instructions.  If such written instructions, indemnification and
     opinions are not received, or proceedings for such determination are
     not commenced within 30 days after receipt by Escrow Agent of notice
     of any such dispute and diligently continued, or if Escrow Agent is
     uncertain as to which party or parties are entitled to the Escrowed
     Property, Escrow Agent may either (i) hold the Escrowed Property until
     receipt of (A) such written instructions and indemnification or (B) a
     certified copy of a final judgment of a court of competent
     jurisdiction providing for the disposition of the Escrowed Property,
     or (ii) deposit the Escrowed Property in the registry of a court of
     competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that notwithstanding the

                                    AGREEMENT
                                    ---------
          AGREEMENT, dated as of December 28, 1993, by and among LEUCADIA
     NATIONAL CORPORATION, a New York corporation ("Employer"), and Joseph
     S. Steinberg ("Executive").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

          WHEREAS, pursuant to an agreement made as of the 12th day of
     March 1984 between Employer's subsidiary, Leucadia, Inc. ("LI") and
     Executive (the "Employment Agreement"), Executive is employed as
     President and Chief Operating Officer of Employer; and

          WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement,
     Executive serves as President and Chief Operating Officer to such of
     Employer's subsidiaries and affiliates as Employer may designate,
     including LI; and

          WHEREAS, the Employment Agreement expires June 30, 1994; and 

          WHEREAS, Employer and Executive have agreed to enter into a new
     employment agreement expiring June 30, 2003; and

          WHEREAS, the total annual compensation paid by Employer or LI to
     Executive over the past few years has exceeded $1 million, and may be
     expected to exceed $1 million in 1994 and subsequent years; and

          WHEREAS, in 1992, in anticipation of changes to the tax laws, LI
     and Executive entered into certain agreements (collectively, the "1992
     Agreements") the effect of which was to accelerate the taxation and
     deductibility of bonus payments otherwise expected to be paid by LI to
     Executive within the five year period commencing January 1, 1993; and

          WHEREAS, federal tax law changes, in fact, have been implemented,
     which will increase the cost of compensation to both Employer and its
     employees beginning in 1994; and

          WHEREAS, to address these developments Employer and Executive
     desire to accelerate the taxation and deductibility of bonus payments
     otherwise expected to be paid by Employer to Executive within the five
     year period commencing January 1, 1998; and
























<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

          WHEREAS, contemporaneously herewith Executive and Employer have
     entered in an Escrow and Security agreement (the "Escrow and Security
     Agreement") of even date herewith; and

          WHEREAS, Employer and Ian M. Cumming (Mr. Cumming, together with
     Executive, collectively, the "Executives"), have entered into an
     Agreement identical to this Agreement and an escrow and security
     agreement identical to the Escrow and Security Agreement.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good
     and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
     hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties
     hereto agree as follows:

          SECTION ONE.  ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION.
          -------------------------------------
          The Employer hereby agrees to pay to (or for the benefit of)
     Executive, as additional compensation, the sum of $4,000,000 (the
     "Fund Amount"), upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

          SECTION TWO.  VESTING IN GENERAL.
          --------------------------------
          Subject to clause (b) of Section Four hereof, Executive's right
     to receive the Fund Amount shall vest at the rate of 20% for each full
     calendar year after December 31, 1997 during which Executive continues
     in the employ of Employer or any of its subsidiaries (collectively,
     the "Employer Group").  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
     Executive's right to receive the Fund Amount shall be 50% vested if
     Executive dies or becomes disabled (as defined in Section 7 of the
     Employment Agreement) prior to December 31, 2000 and shall be 100%
     vested if (i) Executive is terminated by Employer without cause (as
     defined in Section 8 (a)(i) of the Employment Agreement), (ii) an
     Initiating Event (as defined in Annex A hereto) occurs, or (iii)
     Employer becomes subject to the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy or
     similar court in the context of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
     proceeding.  

          For purposes of this Agreement, any portion of the Fund Amount
     vested pursuant to this Section Two or pursuant to Section Four hereof
     shall be referred to as the "Vested Amount."


































     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     


          SECTION THREE.  PAYMENT IN GENERAL.
          ----------------------------------
          (a)  General -- Except as otherwise provided in this Section
               -------
     Three, on January 1, 2003 the Vested Amount as of such date shall be
     paid by Employer to Executive.

          (b)  Payment Upon Termination -- Except as otherwise provided in
               ------------------------
     this Section Three, in the event that Executive's employment with the
     Employer Group terminates prior to January 1, 2003, promptly after the
     date of such termination Employer shall pay to Executive the Vested
     Amount as of the date of such termination.

          (c)  Early Payments -- Pursuant to Section Four and Section Seven
               --------------
     hereof, payments of the Fund Amount may be made to or on behalf of
     Executive prior to January 1, 2003 ("Early Payments").  For purposes
     hereof, the term "Available Fund Amount" shall mean, as of any date,
     an amount equal to the Fund Amount reduced by all Early Payments made
     prior to such date.  If any Early Payment shall have been made, any
     amount required to be paid by Employer to Executive pursuant to clause
     (a) or (b) of this Section Three shall be reduced by the sum of all
     such Early Payments.  To the extent that the sum of all Early Payments
     exceeds the Vested Amount on the earlier of January 1, 2003 or the
     date on which Executive's employment with the Employer Group
     terminates, Executive shall be obligated promptly to pay to Employer
     the amount of such deficiency, plus interest accruing at the prime
     rate, as announced from time to time by Citibank, N.A., compounded
     annually on the amount of the deficiency from the date hereof through
     the date on which Executive makes a payment to Employer pursuant to
     this clause (c).

          SECTION FOUR.  ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT/VESTING.
          ----------------------------------------------
          (a)  Accelerated Payment -- In the sole discretion of the Board
               -------------------
     of Directors of Employer, excluding Executives, upon recommendation of
     the Compensation Committee of Employer, Employer may accelerate
     payment to Executive of all or a portion of the Available Fund Amount. 
     In determining whether or not to accelerate payment of all or any
     portion of the Available Fund Amount, the Board of Directors of
     Employer and the Compensation Committee thereof may consider, among
     other things, the then applicable tax law and the costs and benefits
     to the Employer Group, under the tax law, this Agreement, the Escrow
     and Security Agreement, the 1992 Agreements and otherwise, of
     effecting such acceleration.


























     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

          (b)  Accelerated Vesting -- In the event of any accelerated
               -------------------
     payment pursuant to clause (a) of this Section Four, for all purposes
     hereof the Vested Amount shall equal the greater of (i) the Vested
     Amount computed pursuant to Section Two hereof without regard to this
     Section Four, or (ii) the sum of all payments made pursuant to clause
     (a) of this Section Four, plus an amount equal to the product of the
     Withheld Amount (defined below), if any, and a fraction the numerator
     of which is the sum of all amounts paid pursuant to clause (a) of
     Section Four hereof and the denominator of which is the Fund Amount.

          SECTION FIVE.  ESCROW ARRANGEMENT.
          ---------------------------------
          The obligations of Employer to Executive hereunder shall be
     implemented and secured by way of the Escrow and Security Agreement. 
     Toward that end, any payment obligation of Employer hereunder shall be
     satisfied, to the extent possible, by directing a release from the
     Escrow Amount (as defined in the Escrow and Security Agreement) of the
     appropriate amount to be paid to the Executive.  Such Escrow and
     Security Agreement shall be irrevocable and is intended by the parties
     to secure Employer's obligations to Executive hereunder, and to
     implement such obligations.  As provided in the Escrow and Security
     Agreement, the escrow agent shall be Weil, Gotshal and Manges, the
     investment of the escrow funds shall be directed by the Chief
     Financial Officer of the Employer, the income and earnings realized in
     respect of the escrow fund shall be distributed promptly to Employer,
     and the tax responsibility for such income and earnings shall be borne
     by Employer.

          SECTION SIX. -- TAX ELECTION.
          ----------------------------
          Executive shall timely and properly file an election under
     Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in
     respect of his receipt, as compensation, of this Agreement and his
     interest in the escrow established pursuant to the Escrow and Security
     Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
     Executive's failure timely and properly to file such tax election
     shall result in the immediate termination of Employer's obligations
     hereunder and in a termination of the Escrow and Security Agreement,
     and an immediate return to Employer of the escrowed funds deposited by
     Employer pursuant to such Agreement.

          SECTION SEVEN. -- TAX WITHHOLDING.
          ---------------------------------
          Executive agrees that Employer and/or its subsidiaries or
     affiliates shall effect all required tax withholdings in respect




























     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     of the additional compensation paid pursuant to this Agreement.  At
     Executive's election, $2,097,400 (the "Withheld Amount") of the Fund
     Amount shall be applied by the Employer in satisfaction of its
     withholding obligations.  If Executive makes such election, the Escrow
     Agent (as defined in the Escrow and Security Agreement) shall be
     directed to release the Withheld Amount to Employer.  Notwithstanding
     such election, the Withheld Amount shall remain unvested except as
     otherwise provided in Section Two and Section Four hereof.

          SECTION EIGHT. -- AFFECT ON OTHER AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS.
          -------------------------------------------------------------
          This Agreement shall have no effect on the rights and obligations
     of the parties hereto under any other agreement.  Notwithstanding this
     Agreement, the Board of Directors of Employer, excluding Executives,
     upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee of Employer,
     annually will determine the amount, if any, of bonuses to be paid to
     Executive.  In determining the amount of any such bonus, the Board of
     Directors of Employer and the Compensation Committee thereof will
     consider the costs and benefits to Employer of implementing this
     Agreement, which shall include consideration of changes in the tax
     law, if any.

          SECTION NINE. -- ASSIGNABILITY AND BINDING EFFECT.
          -------------------------------------------------
          This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding
     upon the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and legal
     representatives of Executive, and shall inure to the benefit of and be
     binding upon the Employer and its successors, but the obligations of
     Executive hereunder may not be assigned to another person, firm or
     corporation nor may they be delegated.

          SECTION TEN. -- COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING.
          --------------------------------------
          This Agreement constitutes the complete understanding between the
     parties with respect to the compensation arrangement described herein,
     and no statement, representation, warranty or covenant has been made
     by either party with respect thereto except as expressly set forth
     herein.  This Agreement shall not be altered, modified, amended or
     terminated except by written instrument signed by each of the parties
     hereto.

          SECTION ELEVEN. -- SEVERABILITY.
          -------------------------------
          If any provision of this Agreement or any part hereof is invalid,

                         ESCROW AND SECURITY AGREEMENT 


               ESCROW AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, dated as of December 28,
     1993, by and among LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION, a New York
     corporation ("Employer"), Joseph S. Steinberg ("Executive") and Weil,
     Gotshal and Manges (a partnership including professional corporations)
     ("Escrow Agent").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:


               WHEREAS, pursuant to an agreement made as of the 12th day of
     March 1984 between Employer's subsidiary, Leucadia, Inc. ("LI") and
     Executive (the "Employment Agreement"), Executive is employed as
     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Employer; and 

               WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement,
     Executive serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to such of
     Employer's subsidiaries and affiliates as Employer may designate,
     including LI; and 

               WHEREAS, the Employment Agreement expires June 30, 1994; and

               WHEREAS, Employer and Executive have agreed to enter into a
     new employment agreement expiring June 30, 2003; and

               WHEREAS, in 1992, in anticipation of changes to the tax
     laws, LI and Executive entered into certain agreements (collectively,
     the "1992 Agreements") the effect of which was to accelerate the
     taxation and deductibility of bonus payments otherwise expected to be
     paid by Employer or LI to Executive within the five year period
     commencing January 1, 1993; and

               WHEREAS, federal tax law changes, in fact, have been
     implemented, which will increase the cost of compensation to both
     Employer and its employees beginning in 1994; and

               WHEREAS, to address these developments, Employer and
     Executive have entered into an Agreement dated December 28, 1993
     providing for the establishment of an executive compensation
     arrangement for the benefit of Executive, a copy of which is attached
     hereto as Exhibit A (the "Compensation Agreement"); and


























<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

               WHEREAS, the Compensation Agreement provides for the deposit
     by Employer of $4.0 million (the "Fund Amount") into an escrow account
     (the "Escrow Account") and the release of such funds in accordance
     with the provision of Section 4 hereof; and

               WHEREAS, contemporaneously herewith Employer and Ian M.
     Cumming (Mr. Cumming, together with Executive, collectively, the
     "Executives") have entered into an agreement identical to the
     Compensation Agreement; and 

               WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent is willing to serve as Escrow
     Agent and hold the Fund Amount, plus any interest earned thereon (the
     "Escrowed Property") in accordance with and subject to the terms and
     conditions hereof.

               NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other
     good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
     is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties
     hereto agree as follows:

               1.   Employer and Executive hereby consent to the
     appointment of and hereby appoint Weil, Gotshal & Manges as Escrow
     Agent, to serve as escrow agent in accordance with the terms and
     conditions herein set forth, and Escrow Agent hereby accepts such
     appointment.  

               2.   Security Interest.  The parties hereto agree that the
                    -----------------
     Fund Amount is intended to secure any and all liabilities of Employer
     to Executive under the Compensation Agreement.  Employer hereby grants
     to Employee an irrevocable security interest in the Fund Amount and
     the parties hereto agree that the Fund Amount (i) shall be received
     and held by Escrow Agent for the benefit of Employee and to protect
     the interest of Employee in the Fund Amount, and (ii) shall be
     disbursed by Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms hereof.

               3.   The Fund Amount shall be deposited with Escrow Agent as
     follows:

               (a)  On the date hereof, Employer shall deliver to Escrow
     Agent the Fund Amount.  Escrow Agent shall not be liable or
     responsible for the collection of the proceeds of any check payable or
     endorsed to Escrow Agent hereunder.

               (b)  Escrow Agent shall, in accordance with direction
     provided by the Chief Financial Officer of the Employer, deposit the
     Fund Amount in certificates of deposit or interest bearing accounts of
     any bank or trust company, incorporated under the


























     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     laws of the United States of America or any state, which has combined
     capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000.

               (c)  All interest earned on the Fund Amount ("Interest")
     shall be the property of the Employer and shall not be added to or
     become part of the Escrow Amount (as defined).  All Interest shall be
     paid by the Escrow Agent, on a current basis, to Employer without the
     need for any further action on the part of Employer.

               (d)  The Fund Amount, as such may from time to time be
     decreased by the release of monies from the Fund Amount pursuant to
     the terms hereof, shall constitute the "Escrow Amount."

               4.  The Escrow Amount shall be released by the Escrow Agent
     as follows:

               (a)  Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of Disbursing
     Instructions in the form attached as Annex A hereto executed by both
     Executive and Employer (as evidenced by the signature of a majority of
     the members of Employer's Compensation Committee), Escrow Agent shall
     release to Executive so much of the Escrow Amount as indicated in the
     Disbursing Instructions; and

               (b)  Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of Disbursing
     Instructions in the form attached as Annex B hereto executed by both
     Executive and Employer (as evidenced by the signature of a majority of
     the members of Employer's Compensation Committee), Escrow Agent shall
     release to Employer so much of the Escrow Amount as indicated in the
     Disbursing Instructions

               5.  Any notice or certificate given to Escrow Agent under
     Section 4 shall be by hand or overnight delivery to the parties at the
     addresses set forth in Section 16 of this Agreement.  In the event of
     any dispute, Escrow Agent shall retain the Escrow Amount until the
     dispute is resolved by the final order or judgment of a court having
     jurisdiction with respect thereto.  Reasonable fees and costs of the
     other party or parties shall be advanced by the party giving notice of
     a dispute, and shall be borne by the party or parties not prevailing
     in the action.

               6.   Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
     be fully protected from all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense
     in acting or omitting to act pursuant to, any instruction, order,
     judgment, certification, affidavit, demand, notice, opinion,
     instrument or other writing delivered to it hereunder without being
     required to determine the authenticity of




























     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     such document, the correctness of any fact stated therein, the
     propriety of the service thereof or the capacity, identity or
     authority of any party purporting to sign or deliver such document.

               7.   The duties of Escrow Agent are only as herein
     specifically provided, and are purely ministerial in nature.  Escrow
     Agent shall neither be responsible for, or under, nor chargeable with
     knowledge of, the terms and conditions of any other agreement,
     instrument or document in connection herewith, including, without
     limitation, the agreements referred to in the preamble to this
     Agreement, and shall be required to act in respect of the Fund Amount
     and the Escrow Property only as provided in this Agreement.  This
     Agreement sets forth all the obligations of Escrow Agent with respect
     to any and all matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder
     and no additional obligations of Escrow Agent shall be implied from
     the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement.  Escrow Agent
     shall incur no liability in connection with the discharge of its
     obligations under this Agreement or otherwise in connection therewith,
     except such liability as may arise from the willful misconduct or
     gross negligence of Escrow Agent.

               8.   Escrow Agent may consult with counsel of its choice,
     which may include attorneys in the firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, and
     shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
     Escrow Agent in accordance with the advice of such counsel.

               9.   Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any modification,
     cancellation or rescission of this Agreement unless in writing and
     signed by Escrow Agent.

               10.  Escrow Agent shall have no tax reporting duties with
     respect to the Fund Amount, the Escrow Amount, the Escrowed Property
     or income thereon, such duties being the responsibility of the party
     or parties which receive, or have the right to receive, any taxable
     income hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Escrow Agent has the
     authority to comply with the provisions of Section 468B(g) of the
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations
     promulgated thereunder.  Such authority shall include, without limita-
     tion, (i) the filing of tax returns (including information returns)
     with respect to the Fund Amount, the Escrow Amount, the Escrowed
     Property or income thereon, (ii) the payment of any tax, interest or
     penalties imposed thereon, (iii) the withholding of any amounts which
     are required to be withheld and (iv) the payment over of such withheld
     amounts to the appropriate taxing authority.  The






























     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     parties to this Agreement, other than Escrow Agent, shall provide
     Escrow Agent with all information necessary to enable Escrow Agent to
     comply with the foregoing.  Escrow Agent may withdraw from the Fund
     Amount or the Escrow Amount amounts necessary to pay all applicable
     income or withholding taxes (plus interest and penalties thereon) that
     are required to be paid.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the Fund
     Amount and the Escrow Amount, excluding any Interest thereon, shall be
     the Executive's property unless and until disbursed to Employer
     pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof.

               11.   Escrow Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with
     respect to the Escrowed Property.  If any dispute arises as to whether
     Escrow Agent is obligated to deliver the Escrowed Property or as to
     whom the Escrowed Property is to be delivered or the amount thereof,
     Escrow Agent shall not be required to make any delivery, but in such
     event Escrow Agent may hold the Escrowed Property until receipt by
     Escrow Agent of instructions in writing, signed by all parties which
     have, or claim to have, an interest in the Escrowed Property,
     directing the disposition of the Escrowed Property, or in the absence
     of such authorization, Escrow Agent may hold the Escrowed Property
     until receipt of a certified copy of a final judgment of a court of
     competent jurisdiction providing for the disposition of the Escrowed
     Property.  Escrow Agent may require, as a condition to the disposition
     of the Escrowed Property pursuant to written instructions,
     indemnification and/or opinions of counsel, in form and substance
     satisfactory to Escrow Agent, from each party providing such
     instructions.  If such written instructions, indemnification and
     opinions are not received, or proceedings for such determination are
     not commenced within 30 days after receipt by Escrow Agent of notice
     of any such dispute and diligently continued, or if Escrow Agent is
     uncertain as to which party or parties are entitled to the Escrowed
     Property, Escrow Agent may either (i) hold the Escrowed Property until
     receipt of (A) such written instructions and indemnification or (B) a
     certified copy of a final judgment of a court of competent
     jurisdiction providing for the disposition of the Escrowed Property,
     or (ii) deposit the Escrowed Property in the registry of a court of
     competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
     foregoing, Escrow Agent may, but shall not be required to, institute
     legal proceedings of any kind.

               12.  Employer and Executive, jointly and severally, agree to
     reimburse Escrow Agent on demand for, and to indemnify and hold Escrow
     Agent harmless against and with respect to, any and all loss,
     liability, damage, or expense (including, without limitation, taxes,
     attorneys' fees and costs) that Escrow Agent





























     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     may suffer or incur in connection with the entering into of this
     Agreement and performance of its obligations under this Agreement or
     otherwise in connection therewith, except to the extent such loss,
     liability, damage or expense arises from the willful misconduct of
     Escrow Agent.  Escrow Agent, after not less than ten days prior
     written notice to the other parties hereto, shall have the right at
     any time and from time from time to charge, and reimburse itself from,
     the Escrowed Property for all amounts to which it is entitled pursuant
     this Agreement.

               13.  Escrow Agent and any successor escrow agent may at any
     time resign as such by delivering the Escrowed Property to either (i)
     any successor escrow agent designated by all the parties hereto (other
     than Escrow Agent) in writing, or (ii) any court having competent
     jurisdiction.  Upon its resignation and delivery of the Escrowed
     Property as set forth in this paragraph, Escrow Agent shall be
     discharged of, and from, any and all further obligations arising in
     connection with the escrow contemplated by this Agreement.  

               14.  Escrow Agent shall have the right to represent any
     party hereto in any dispute between the parties hereto with respect to
     the Escrowed Property or otherwise.

               15.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be
     binding upon, the parties hereto and their respective permitted
     successors and assigns.  Nothing in this Agreement, express or
     implied, shall give to anyone, other than the parties hereto and their
     respective permitted successors and assigns, any benefit, or any legal
     or equitable right, remedy or claim, under or in respect of this
     Agreement or the escrow contemplated hereby. 

               16.  Except as specifically provided otherwise herein, any
     notice authorized or required to be given to a party hereto pursuant
     to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given when hand-
     delivered, or when mailed by United States certified or registered
