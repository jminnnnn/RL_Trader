     Item 1.   Business.
     ------    --------
                                   THE COMPANY

     GENERAL

          The Company is a diversified financial services holding company
     principally engaged in personal and commercial lines of property and
     casualty insurance, life and health insurance, banking and lending and
     manufacturing.  The Company concentrates on return on investment and
     cash flow to build long-term shareholder value, rather than
     emphasizing volume or market share.  Additionally, the Company
     continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing
     operations and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in
     order to maximize shareholder value.

          Shareholders' equity has grown from a deficit of $7,657,000 at
     December 31, 1978 (prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest
     in the Company by the Company's Chairman and President), to a positive
     shareholders' equity of $1,111,491,000 at December 31, 1995, equal to
     a book value per common share of negative $.11 at December 31, 1978
     and $18.47 at December 31, 1995.

          The Company's principal operations are its insurance businesses,
     where it is a specialty markets provider of property and casualty and
     life insurance products to niche markets.  The Company's principal
     personal lines insurance products are automobile insurance, homeowners
     insurance, graded benefit life insurance marketed primarily to the age
     50-and-over population and variable annuity products.  The Company's
     principal commercial lines are property and casualty products provided
     for multi-family residential real estate, retail establishments and
     livery vehicles in the New York metropolitan area.  For the year ended
     December 31, 1995, the Company's insurance segments contributed 78% of
     total revenue and, at December 31, 1995, constituted 77% of
     consolidated assets.

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries have a diversified
     investment portfolio of securities, substantially all of which are
     issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by U.S. governmental
     agencies or are rated "investment grade" by Moody's Investors Service
     Inc. ("Moody's") and/or Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P"). 
     Investments in mortgage loans, real estate and non-investment grade
     securities represented 2.5% of the insurance subsidiaries' portfolio
     at December 31, 1995.  

          The Company's banking and lending operations principally consist
     of making instalment loans to niche markets primarily funded by
     customer banking deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
     Company (the "FDIC").  One of the Company's principal lending
     activities is providing automobile loans to individuals with poor
     credit histories.  The Company's manufacturing operations primarily
     manufacture products for the "do-it-yourself" home improvement market
     and for industrial and agricultural markets.

          Starting in 1994, the Company has made investments outside the
     United States in Russia and Argentina and expects to increase its
     investments in Russia in 1996.  For more information concerning these
     investments see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
     Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Report.

          The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have substantial tax
     loss carryforwards.  The amount and availability of the tax loss
     carryforwards are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and
     uncertainties as more fully discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated
     Financial Statements.

          On November 15, 1995, the Company effected a two-for-one stock
     split of the common shares of the Company (the "Common Shares") in the
     form of a 100% stock dividend (the "Stock Split").  The dividend was
     paid to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 1,
     1995.  Per share amounts set forth in this Report have been adjusted
     to reflect the Stock Split.
   
          As used herein, the term "Company" refers to Leucadia National
     Corporation, a New York corporation organized in 1968, and its
     subsidiaries, except as the context otherwise may require.

     rated CPL and Charter "A" (excellent) and CPI, Madison, Franklin, the
     Empire Group and Intramerica "A-" (excellent).  Bayside and Bay Colony

     Company's property and casualty operations prepared in accordance with
     generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and statutory
     accounting principles ("SAP").  The Loss Ratio is the ratio of
     incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to net premiums earned. 
     The Expense Ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses (policy
     acquisition costs, commissions, and a portion of administrative,
     general and other expenses attributable to underwriting operations) to
     net premiums written, if determined in accordance with SAP, or to net
     premiums earned, if determined in accordance with GAAP.  A Combined
     Ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit and a Combined Ratio
     above 100% indicates an underwriting loss.  The Combined Ratio does
     not include the effect of investment income.

            Industry combined ratios may not be fully comparable as a result of,
            among other things, differences in geographical concentration and in the
            mix of property and casualty insurance products.

      (b)   For 1995, a change in the statutory accounting treatment for retrospec-
            tively rated reinsurance agreements was the principal reason for the
            difference between the GAAP Combined Ratio and the SAP Combined Ratio. 
            For 1993, the difference reflects the different treatment of certain
            costs for GAAP and SAP purposes.

          The Colonial Penn P&C Group

          The Colonial Penn P&C Group's primary business is providing
     private passenger automobile and homeowners insurance coverage to the
     mature adult population.  Substantially all of the Group's policies
     are written for a one-year period.  However, in many states CPI and
     Franklin offer a "guaranteed lifetime protection" provision to certain
     qualifying policyholders that ensures their policies will be renewed
     at rates then in effect for their classification.  As of December 31,
     1995, the Group had approximately 356,000 voluntary auto policies in
     force.

          In 1995, for the first time since acquisition in 1991, the
     Colonial Penn P&C Group's voluntary automobile policies in force have
     grown during the year.  The Company believes that this is attributable
     to its low cost direct response marketing methods.  The Company
     believes the Colonial Penn P&C Group will continue to grow its
     voluntary automobile business during 1996, although the Company is
     unable to estimate the rate of growth or state with certainty that
     such growth will actually occur.

          The Colonial Penn P&C Group primarily markets its insurance
     products to the standard and preferred risk market segments through
     direct response marketing methods.  Direct response marketing includes
     any form of marketing in which a company and a customer deal directly
     with each other, rather than through an insurance agent.  The Colonial
     Penn P&C Group has become a low cost provider of its products to its
     niche markets, enabling it to charge competitive rates.

          Based on published reports, the Colonial Penn P&C Group's SAP
     Expense Ratio for 1994, the last year for which annual industry data
     is available, is among the lowest in the industry.

      (1)   Excludes net earned premiums related to acquired blocks of assigned risk
            business described below and mandatory assumed risk business, which generally
            relates to the amount of writings in the applicable state.

</TABLE>

            In recent years, the Colonial Penn P&C Group has acquired blocks
     of private passenger automobile assigned risk business from other
     insurance companies.  In addition to the premiums paid by
     policyholders, the Group also receives fee income from the insurance
     company from which the business was acquired.  The Group's low expense
     ratio enables it to offer competitive rates for this business.  The
     Colonial Penn P&C Group currently has contracts in force covering
     approximately $110,000,000 of annualized written premium.

          Prior to its acquisition by the Company, CPI wrote as primary
     insurer or as a reinsurer a variety of diverse commercial property and
     casualty insurance business known as "Special Risks."  The nature of
     most of this insurance, which was not written after 1988, involves
     exposures which can be expected to develop over a relatively long
     period of time before a definitive determination of ultimate losses
     and loss adjustment expenses can be established and the relevant
     reinsurance collected.  Although losses with respect to this block of
     business are particularly difficult to predict accurately, the Company
     believes, based in part upon a recently completed independent
     actuarial review, that it has recorded adequate reserves as of
     December 31, 1995 ($59,400,000, before reinsurance).

          The Empire Group

          The Empire Group provides personal insurance coverage to
     automobile owners and homeowners and commercial insurance for
     residential real estate, restaurants, retail establishments, livery
     vehicles (both medallion and radio-controlled) and several types of
     service contractors.

          For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, net earned
     premiums and commissions for the Empire Group were $326,100,000,
     $299,200,000 and $259,400,000, respectively.  Substantially all of the
     Empire Group policies are written in New York for a one-year period. 
     The Empire Group is licensed in New York to write all lines of
     insurance that may be written by a property and casualty insurer,
     except residual value, credit, unemployment, animal and marine protection 
     and indemnity insurance and ocean marine insurance.

          The voluntary business of the Empire Group is produced through
     general agents, local agents and insurance brokers, who are
     compensated for their services by payment of commissions on the
     premiums they generate.  There are five general agents, one of which
     is owned by Empire, and approximately 385 local agents and insurance
     brokers presently acting under agreements with the Empire Group. 
     These agents and brokers also represent other competing insurance
     companies.

          Like the Colonial Penn P&C Group, the Empire Group also has
     acquired blocks of private passenger automobile and commercial
     automobile assigned risk business from other insurance companies.  The
     Empire Group currently has contracts in force covering approximately
     $100,000,000 of annualized written premiums.  In addition, the Empire
     Group receives a fee as a "servicing carrier," providing
     administrative services, including claims processing, underwriting and
     collection activities, for the New York Public Automobile Pool and the
     Massachusetts Taxi and Limousine Pool.  These latter arrangements do
     not involve the assumption of any material underwriting risk by the
     Empire Group.

          During 1995, the Empire Group strengthened reserves in certain
     lines of business, as more fully discussed in Item 7, "Management's
     Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
     Operations," of this Report.  As a result of the Empire Group's poor
     operating results in 1995, management is currently evaluating its
     operations, including policy pricing, underwriting, claims handling
     procedures and market segment profitability.  The Empire Group intends
     to concentrate its efforts on the profitability of its products and,
     as a result, premium volume may decline.

          Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

          Liabilities for unpaid losses, which are not discounted (except
     for certain workers' compensation liabilities), and loss adjustment
     expenses ("LAE") are determined using case-basis evaluations,
     statistical analyses and estimates for salvage and subrogation
     recoverable and represent estimates of the ultimate claim costs of all
     unpaid losses and LAE.  Liabilities include a provision for losses
     which have occurred but have not yet been reported.  These estimates
     are subject to the effect of trends in future claim severity and
     frequency experience.  Adjustments to such estimates are made from
     time to time due to changes in loss experience and are reflected in
     current earnings.

          The Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries rely
     upon standard actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques to obtain
     estimates of liabilities for losses and LAE.  These projections
     include the extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by business
     line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation
     and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon
     historical patterns.  In addition, methods based upon average loss
     costs, reported claim counts and pure premiums are reviewed in order
     to obtain a range of estimates for setting the reserve levels.  For
     further input, changes in operations in pertinent areas including
     underwriting standards, product mix, claims management and legal
     climate are periodically reviewed.

          In the following table, the liability for losses and LAE of the
     Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are reconciled
     for each of the three years ended December 31, 1995.  Included therein
     are current year data and prior year development.

</TABLE>

          The Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries'
     liability for losses and LAE as of December 31, 1995 was
     $1,005,354,000 determined in accordance with SAP and $1,128,952,000
     determined in accordance with GAAP.  The difference principally
     relates to liabilities assumed by reinsurers, which are not deducted
     from GAAP liabilities.

          The following tables present the development of balance sheet
     liabilities from 1985 through 1995 and include periods prior to
     acquisition for the Empire Group and the Colonial Penn P&C Group. 
     Because of substantial differences in the development of reserves of
     the Empire Group and the Colonial Penn P&C Group, loss and LAE
     development data is presented separately for each group.  The
     liability line at the top of each table indicates the estimated
     liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded as of the dates
     indicated.  The middle section of the table shows the re-estimated

                                       7      
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
 
     amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the
     end of each succeeding year. As more information becomes available and
     claims are settled, the estimated liabilities are adjusted upward or
     downward with the effect of decreasing or increasing net income at the time
     of adjustment. The lower section of the table shows the cumulative amount
     paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of
     each succeeding year.

          The "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" represents the aggregate
     change in the estimates over all prior years.  For example, the
     initial 1985 liability estimate indicated on the Empire Group table
     ($165,713,000) has been re-estimated during the course of the
     succeeding ten years, resulting in a re-estimated liability at
     December 31, 1995 of $156,838,000, or a redundancy of $8,875,000.  If
     the re-estimated liability exceeded the liability initially
     established, a cumulative deficiency would be indicated.  The
     cumulative deficiencies reflected in the Colonial Penn P&C Group table
     are for periods prior to the Company's acquisition of that Group.  The
     Company believes that the Colonial Penn P&C Group's conservatism and
     improved claims management procedures since acquisition in 1991 have
     contributed significantly to the creation of the redundancies included
     in its table below.

          In evaluating this information, it should be noted that each
     amount shown for "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" includes the
     effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods.  For example, the
     amount of the redundancy (deficiency) related to losses settled in
     1989, but incurred in 1985, will be included in the cumulative
     redundancy (deficiency) amount for 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988.  This
     table is not intended to and does not present accident or policy year
     loss and LAE development data.  Conditions and trends that have
     affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily
     occur in the future.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to
     extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on these tables.

          For further discussion of the Company's loss development
     experience, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
     Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Report.

          Life and Health Insurance Products

          Graded Benefit Life.  "Graded Benefit Life" is a guaranteed-issue
     product.  These modified-benefit, whole life policies are offered on
     an individual basis primarily to persons age 50 to 80, principally in
     face amounts of $350 to $10,000, without medical examination or
     evidence of insurability.  Premiums are paid as frequently as monthly. 
     Benefits paid are less than the face amount of the policy during the
     first two years, except in cases of accidental death.  Graded Benefit
     Life is marketed using direct response marketing techniques.  New
     policyholder leads are generated primarily from television
     advertisements.  The Company intends to continue to concentrate its
     marketing efforts towards soliciting new policyholders where the cost
     is justified, upgrading existing policyholders' policy packages and
     obtaining referrals from existing policyholders.

          Investment Oriented Products.  The principal investment oriented
     product ("IOP" product) offered is a no-load variable annuity ("VA")
     product.  The VA product is marketed as an investment vehicle to
     individuals seeking to defer, for federal income tax purposes, the
     annual increase in their account balance.  Premiums from this VA
     product either are invested at the policyholders' election in
     unaffiliated mutual funds where the policyholder bears the entire
     investment risk or in a fixed account where the funds earn interest at
     rates determined by the Company.  The Company's VA product is
     currently marketed in conjunction with Scudder, Stevens and Clark, a
     mutual fund manager.

          Medicare Supplement Products.  In 1992, the Company decided to
     discontinue actively marketing Medicare supplement products due to
     increased competition in this market.  The increased competition
     resulted from federal and state regulation that mandated
     standardization of such products.  The Company does continue to offer,
     on a profitable basis, renewals of its non-standardized products to
     existing policyholders.  In addition, in 1996 the Company entered into
     an agreement to acquire a small block of Medicare supplement business;
     the Company will continue to explore the acquisition of additional
     blocks of this business on a profitable basis.

     INSURANCE OPERATIONS - GENERAL

          Investments

          Investment activities represent a significant part of the
     Company's insurance related revenues and profitability.  Investments
     are managed by the Company's investment advisors under the direction
     of, and upon consultation with, the Company's several investment
     committees.

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries have a diversified
     investment portfolio of securities, substantially all of which are
     rated "investment grade" by Moody's and/or S&P or issued or guaranteed
     by the U.S. Treasury or by governmental agencies.  The Company's
     insurance subsidiaries do not generally invest in less than
     "investment grade" or "non-rated" securities, real estate or
     mortgages, although from time to time they may make such investments
     in amounts not expected to be material.

          The composition of the Company's insurance subsidiaries'
     investment portfolio as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 was as follows:

          Reinsurance

          Reinsurance is obtained for investment oriented products for face
     amounts in excess of $500,000 per life.  The life insurance
     subsidiaries generally do not obtain reinsurance for the Graded
     Benefit Life products because these policies generally have a low face
     amount.  The Colonial Penn P&C Group obtained reinsurance for casualty
     risks in excess of $2,000,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, although most
     Colonial Penn P&C Group automobile policies do not have policy limits
     in excess of $100,000 per risk and $300,000 per accident.  The Empire
     Group's maximum retained limit for workers' compensation was $500,000
     for 1995, 1994 and 1993; for other property and casualty lines, the

                                       12
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     

     Empire Group's maximum retained limit was $225,000 for 1995, 1994 and 1993.

          Additionally, the Company's property and casualty insurance
     subsidiaries have entered into certain excess of loss and catastrophe
     treaties to protect against certain losses.  The Colonial Penn P&C
     Group's retention of lower level losses in such treaties was
     $15,000,000 in 1995 and $11,000,000 in 1994 and 1993.  The Empire
     Group's retention of lower level losses in such treaties was
     $3,000,000 for 1995, 1994 and 1993.

          Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from
     its primary liability for the full amount of the policy liability, it
     does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent
     of the reinsurance ceded.   The Company's reinsurance generally has
     been placed with certain of the largest reinsurance companies,
     including (with their respective Best ratings) General Reinsurance
     Corporation (A++), Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (A+), AXA
     Reinsurance Company (A), Zurich Reinsurance Center, Inc. (A) and
     Munich American Reinsurance Company (A+), each of which the Company
     believes to be financially capable of meeting its respective
     obligations.  However, to the extent that any reinsuring company is
     unable to meet its obligations, the Company's insurance subsidiaries
     would be liable for the reinsured risks.  The Company has established
     reserves, which the Company believes are adequate, for any
     nonrecoverable reinsurance.

          Competition

          The insurance industry is a highly competitive industry, in which
     many of the Company's competitors have substantially greater financial
     resources, larger sales forces, more widespread agency and broker
     relationships, and more diversified lines of insurance coverage. 
     Additionally, certain competitors market their products with
     endorsements from affinity groups, while the Company's products are
     for the most part unendorsed, which may give such other companies a
     competitive advantage.  Recent federal legislative and judicial
     activity may result in changes to federal banking laws that will
     enable banks to offer certain insurance products in direct competition
     with the Company.  The Company is unable to determine what effect, if
     any, such changes may have on the Company's operations.

          The Company believes that property and casualty insurers
     generally compete on the basis of price, customer service, consumer
     recognition and financial stability.  The industry has historically
     been cyclical in nature, with periods of less intense price competi-
     tion generating significant profits, followed by periods of increased
     price competition resulting in reduced profitability or loss.  The
     current cycle of intense price competition has continued for a longer
     period than in the past, suggesting that the significant infusion of
     capital into the industry in recent years, coupled with larger
     investment returns has been, and may continue to be, a depressing
     influence on policy rates.  The profitability of the property and
     casualty insurance industry is affected by many factors, including
     rate competition, severity and frequency of claims (including
     catastrophe losses), interest rates, state regulation, court decisions
     and judicial climate, all of which are outside the Company's control.

          Government Regulation

          Insurance companies are subject to detailed regulation and
     supervision in the states in which they transact business.  Such
     regulation pertains to matters such as approving policy forms and
     various premium rates, minimum reserves and loss ratio requirements,
     the type and amount of investments, minimum capital and surplus
     requirements, granting and revoking licenses to transact business,
     levels of operations and regulating trade practices.  The majority of
     the Company's property and casualty insurance operations are in states
     requiring prior approval by regulators before proposed rates may be
     implemented.  Certain states have indicated that they may change the
     bases (e.g., age, sex and geographic location) on which rates
     traditionally have been established.  Rates proposed for life
     insurance generally become effective immediately upon filing. 
     Insurance companies are required to file detailed annual reports with
     the supervisory agencies in each of the states in which they do
     business, and are subject to examination by such agencies at any time. 
     Increased regulation of insurance companies at the state level and new
     regulation at the federal level is possible, although the Company
     cannot predict the nature or extent of any such regulation or what
     impact it would have on the Company's operations.

          The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has
     adopted model laws incorporating the concept of a "risk based capital"
     ("RBC") requirement for insurance companies.  Generally, the RBC
     formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory
     capital in relation to the risks inherent in its business.  The RBC
     formula is used by the states as an early warning tool to identify
     weakly capitalized companies for the purpose of initiating regulatory
     action.  Each of the Company's insurance subsidiaries' RBC ratio as of
     December 31, 1995 substantially exceeded minimum requirements.

          The NAIC also has adopted various ratios for insurance companies
     which, in addition to the RBC ratio, are designed to serve as a tool
     to assist state regulators in discovering potential weakly capitalized
     companies or companies with unusual trends.  The life insurance
     companies had certain "other than normal" NAIC ratios for the year
     ended December 31, 1995.  The Company believes that there are no
     underlying problems or weaknesses at any of its life insurance
     subsidiaries and that it is unlikely that material adverse regulatory
     action will be taken.

          The Company's insurance subsidiaries are members of state
     insurance funds which provide certain protection to policyholders of
     insolvent insurers doing business in those states.  Due to
     insolvencies of certain insurers in recent years, the Company's
     insurance subsidiaries have been assessed certain amounts which have
     not been material and are likely to be assessed additional amounts by
     state insurance funds.  The Company believes that it has provided for
     all anticipated assessments and that any additional assessments will
     not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
     condition or results of operations.

                               BANKING AND LENDING

          During 1995 the Company's banking and lending operations
     principally were conducted through American Investment Bank, N.A.
     ("AIB"), its national bank subsidiary, American Investment Financial
     ("AIF"), an industrial loan corporation, and Transportation Capital
     Corp. ("TCC"), a specialized small business investment company.  AIB
     and AIF take money market and other non-demand deposits that are
     eligible for insurance provided by the FDIC.  AIB and AIF had deposits
     of $203,061,000 and $179,888,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
     respectively.  AIB and AIF currently have several deposit-taking and
     lending facilities in the Salt Lake City area.  TCC makes
     collateralized loans to operators of medallion taxicabs and
     limousines.  In February 1996, the Company entered into an agreement
     to sell TCC to an unrelated third party.  The sale, which is subject
     to regulatory approval and certain other conditions, would result in a
     gain of approximately $1,600,000.

          The Company's consolidated banking and lending operations had
     outstanding loans (net of unearned finance charges) of $278,391,000
     and $264,196,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  At
     December 31, 1995, 48% were loans to individuals generally
     collateralized by automobiles; 15% were unsecured loans to individuals
     acquired from others in connection with investments in limited
     partnerships; 29% were unsecured loans to executives and
     professionals; 4% were loans to small business concerns collateralized
     principally by taxicab medallions and other personal property; and 4%
     were instalment loans to consumers, substantially all of which were
     collateralized by real or personal property.

          It is the Company's policy to charge to income an allowance for
     losses which, based upon management's analysis of numerous factors,
     including current economic trends, aging of the loan portfolio and
     historical loss experience, is deemed adequate to cover reasonably
     expected losses on outstanding loans.  At December 31, 1995, the
     allowance for loan losses for the Company's entire loan portfolio was
     $13,893,000 or 5% of the net outstanding loans, compared to
     $12,308,000 or 4.7% of net outstanding loans at December 31, 1994.

          The funds generated by the deposits are primarily used to make
     instalment loans, including collateralized personal automobile loans
     to individuals who have difficulty in obtaining credit.  These
     automobile loans are made at interest rates above those charged to
     individuals with good credit histories.  In determining which
     individuals qualify for these loans, the Company takes into account a
     number of highly selective criteria with respect to the individual as
     well as the collateral to attempt to minimize the number of defaults. 
     Additionally, the Company closely monitors these loans and takes
     prompt possession of the collateral in the event of a default.  For
     the three year period ended December 31, 1995, the Company generated
     $231,825,000 of these loans ($79,481,000 during 1995).  In 1995,
     primarily as a result of increased competition together with the
     Company's unwillingness to lower its underwriting standards and
     interest rate charges, the portfolio has not grown at the rate
     previously experienced and loan losses have increased.  At December
     31, 1995, the allowance for loan losses for this portfolio was
     $8,822,000 or 6.6% of net outstanding loans.  The Company expects that
     the increased level of competition will continue and, together with
     the Company's unwillingness to lower rates, is likely to result in a
     contraction in the size of this portfolio in the future.

          The Company's lending operations compete with banks, savings and
     loan associations, credit unions, credit card issuers and consumer
     finance companies, many of which are able to offer financial services
     on very competitive terms.  Additionally, substantial national
     financial services networks have been formed by major brokerage firms,
     insurance companies, retailers and bank holding companies.  Some
     competitors have substantial local market positions; others are part
     of large, diversified organizations.  

          The Company's principal lending operations are subject to
     detailed supervision by state authorities, as well as federal
     regulation pursuant to the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and
     regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission.  The
     Company's banking operations are subject to federal and state
     regulation and supervision by, among others, the Office of the
     Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), the FDIC and the State of
     Utah.  AIB's primary federal regulator is the OCC, while the primary
     federal regulator for AIF is the FDIC.

          The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 ("CEBA") places
     certain restrictions on the operations and growth of AIB and restricts
     further acquisitions of banks and savings institutions by the Company. 
     CEBA does not restrict the growth of AIF as currently operated.

                                  MANUFACTURING

          The Company's manufacturing operations consist primarily of the
     manufacture of bathroom vanities and related products for the "do-it-
     yourself" market, electrical products and proprietary plastic netting
     for various industrial and agricultural markets.

          Bathroom vanities and related products are sold through
     manufacturers' representatives, primarily to home improvement centers. 
     Principally due to operating inefficiencies and pricing pressures,
     this division has not operated profitably in recent years.  In 1995,
     the Company completed a restructuring program at this division and, as
     a result, operating results were significantly improved, although the
     division had a loss for the year.  The division is exploring new
     product opportunities to compensate for declining sales.  The plastics
     division manufactures and markets plastic netting used for a variety
     of purposes including among other things, construction, packaging,
     agriculture, carpet backing and filtration.  The electrical division
     primarily produces wire cable and power cords for industrial
     customers.  

          The manufacturing operations are subject to a high degree of
     competition, generally on the basis of price, service and quality. 
     Additionally, certain of these manufacturing operations are dependent
     on cyclical industries, including the construction industry.  Through
     its various manufacturing divisions, the Company holds patents on
     certain improvements to the basic manufacturing processes and on
     applications thereof.  The Company believes that the expiration of
     these patents, individually or in the aggregate, is unlikely to have a
     material effect on manufacturing operations.

                        OTHER OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS

          The Company owns equity interests representing more than 5% of
     the outstanding capital stock of each of the following domestic public
     companies at December 31, 1995:  Carmike Cinemas, Inc. ("Carmike")
     (approximately 6% of Class A shares), HomeFed Corporation ("HFC")
     (approximately 41%), Jordan Industries, Inc. ("JII") (approximately
     11%), MK Gold Company ("MK Gold") (approximately 46%) and Rockefeller
     Center Properties, Inc. ("RCP") (approximately 7%).

          In June 1995, the Company purchased a 46.4% common stock interest
     in MK Gold for an aggregate cash purchase price of $22,500,000.  In
     addition, the Company purchased at par all of a lender's interest
     under a $20,000,000 revolving credit facility with MK Gold, of which
     $15,000,000 was outstanding.  This amount was repaid during the third
     quarter of 1995.  MK Gold is an international gold mining company
     whose shares are quoted on the Nasdaq National Market System.  

          In July 1995, pursuant to the chapter 11 reorganization of HFC,
     the Company acquired 41.2% of HFC's common stock for a net cash
     investment of approximately $4,200,000.  As part of the reorganization
     plan, the Company provided HFC with a $20,000,000 eight year secured
     loan, which is convertible into additional shares of HFC common stock
     after three years (subject to certain conditions) and which bears
     interest at the rate of 12% per year.  HFC is a public company whose
     subsidiaries develop real property.

          The Company owns a 30% interest in Caja de Ahorro y Seguro S.A.
     ("Caja"),  a holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged in
     property and casualty insurance, life insurance and banking in
     Argentina.  Caja distributes its insurance products primarily on a
     direct basis, and therefore does not pay commissions to agents.  Caja
     is the largest insurance company in Argentina, with total annual
     premium revenues of approximately $500,000,000 and total assets
     (including banking operations) of approximately $590,000,000. 
     At December 31, 1995, the carrying amount of the Company's investment
     in Caja was $44,657,000.  The Company's equity in Caja's earnings

          A subsidiary of the Company is a partner in The Jordan Company
     and Jordan/Zalaznick Capital Company.  These partnerships each
     specialize in structuring leveraged buyouts in which the partners are
     given the opportunity to become equity participants.  Since 1982, the
     Company has invested an aggregate of $34,377,000 in these partnerships
     and related companies and, through December 31, 1995, has received
     $73,940,000 (including cash, interest bearing notes and other
     receivables) relating to the disposition of investments and management
     and other fees.  At December 31, 1995, through these partnerships, the
     Company had interests in JII, Carmike and a total of twenty other
     companies (the "Jordan Associated Companies"), all of which are
     carried at cost in the Company's consolidated financial statements at
     $12,623,000.

          The Company's real estate investments include a 615,000 square
     foot office building located near Grand Central Terminal in New York
     City (carried at $55,490,000 at December 31, 1995), and two luxury
     residential condominium towers in downtown San Diego, California
     (carried at $40,028,000 at December 31, 1995).  The New York City
     office building has 355,000 square feet of contiguous space available
     for occupancy.  After certain improvements to the building are
     completed, the Company intends to lease the available space to one or
     more entities and/or sell the building.  The San Diego towers consist
     of 201 residential units, 162 of which were available for sale at
     December 31, 1995, and 42,000 square feet of retail space.

     ----------------------------
     Company's current Board of Directors and two former directors, John W.
     Jordan II and Melvin Hirsch.  The action, which was filed in the
     United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
     alleged certain Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act,
     securities law, conversion and fraud claims that were dismissed with
     prejudice by the Court and two state law claims of waste and breach of
     fiduciary duty that were dismissed by the Court for lack of
     jurisdiction.  On January 11, 1996, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal
     with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

        The Combined Ratio does not reflect the effect of investment income.  For 1995, a change in the statutory accounting
        treatment for retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements was the principal reason for the difference between the
        GAAP Combined Ratios and the SAP Combined Ratios.  For 1993, the difference reflects the different treatment of
        certain costs for GAAP and SAP purposes.  For 1992, the results of certain accident and health insurance business had
        a non-recurring income item which reduced the SAP Combined Ratio.  In addition, in 1992 certain income credits were
        recognized only for GAAP purposes.

(d)     Source:  Best's Aggregates & Averages, Property/Casualty, 1995 Edition.  Industry Combined Ratios may not be fully

     Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
     ------   -----------------------------------------------------------
              and Results of Operations.
              -------------------------

          The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the
     Company's consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital
     resources and results of operations.  This analysis should be read in
     conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related
     notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.

     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          Parent Company Liquidity.  Leucadia National Corporation (the
          ------------------------
     "Parent") is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the
     stock of its several direct subsidiaries.  Additionally, the Parent
     continuously evaluates its existing operations and investigates
     possible acquisitions of new businesses and dispositions of businesses
     in order to maximize its ultimate economic value to shareholders. 
     Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement,
     commitment or understanding with respect thereto (except as disclosed
     in this Report), further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and
     changes in capital structure are possible.  Its principal sources of
     funds are its available cash resources, bank borrowings, public
     financings, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds distributed from
     its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other fees,
     and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated
     subsidiaries.  It has no substantial recurring cash requirements other
     than payment of interest and principal on its debt, tax payments and
     corporate overhead expenses.

          The Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and
     its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to
     certain of its subsidiaries.  These borrowings have primarily been
     made on an unsecured basis from banks through various credit agreement
     facilities and term loans, and through public financings.  During the
     year ended December 31, 1995, the Company used a portion of its
     $150,000,000 bank credit agreement facilities in connection with the
     MK Gold transaction and to meet daily cash requirements.  At December
     31, 1995, there were no amounts outstanding under such bank credit
     agreement facilities.  The Company's bank borrowings bear interest
     based on the prime rate or LIBOR.  The Company is exposed to interest
     rate risk related to its variable rate borrowings.  The Company has
     entered into interest rate swap and interest rate option agreements to
     reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate
     debt.  Counterparties to these agreements are major financial
     institutions, which the Company believes are able to fulfill their
     obligations; however, if they are not, the Company believes that any
     losses are unlikely to be material.

          In June 1995, the Company sold $100,000,000 principal amount of
     its newly authorized 8 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2005 in an
     underwritten public offering.  A portion of the proceeds was used to
     repay indebtedness outstanding under the Company's bank credit
     agreement facilities incurred in connection with the MK Gold
     transaction.  The remaining proceeds were added to working capital.

          On September 13, 1995, Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg,
     Chairman of the Board and President of the Company, respectively, and
     certain members of Mr. Cumming's family exercised previously granted
     warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,188,000 Common Shares and sold
     such shares in an underwritten public offering.  In connection with
     such public offering, the Company granted the underwriters an over
     allotment option, which was exercised, for 478,200 Common Shares. 
     Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company was required to
     pay expenses of the sale, other than underwriting discounts.  As a
     result of the exercise of the warrants and the exercise of the over
     allotment option, the Company realized aggregate cash proceeds, net of
     expenses, of $43,736,000.  For income tax purposes, the exercise of
     the warrants results in the Company receiving a current income tax
     deduction of $57,305,000.  For financial reporting purposes, the
     benefit of such deduction ($20,057,000) was credited directly to
     shareholders' equity.

          At December 31, 1995, a maximum of approximately $60,200,000 was
     available to the Parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiaries
     without regulatory approval.  Additional amounts may be available to
     the Parent in the form of loans or cash advances from regulated
     subsidiaries, although no amounts were outstanding at December 31,
     1995 or borrowed to date in 1996.  There are no restrictions on
     distributions from the non-regulated subsidiaries; the Parent and its
     non-regulated subsidiaries had aggregate cash and temporary
     investments of approximately $164,400,000 at December 31, 1995.  The
     Parent also receives tax sharing payments from subsidiaries included
     in its consolidated income tax return, including certain regulated
     subsidiaries.  Because of the tax loss carryforwards available to the
     Parent and certain subsidiaries, together with current interest
     deductions and corporate expenses, the amount paid by the Parent for
     income taxes is substantially less than tax sharing payments received
     from its subsidiaries.  In addition, the Parent receives payments from
     the regulated and non-regulated entities for services provided by the
     Parent.  Payments from regulated subsidiaries for dividends, tax
     sharing payments and other services totaled approximately $64,900,000
     during the year ended December 31, 1995.

          Based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the
     Company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds
     under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for
     appropriate investment opportunities.  Since 1993, the Company's
     senior debt obligations have been rated as "investment grade" by
     Moody's, S&P and Duff & Phelps Inc.  Ratings issued by bond rating
     agencies are subject to change at any time.

          In March 1996, the Company retired at maturity its 6% Swiss Franc
     Bond issue and underlying currency swap agreement, which had an
     outstanding principal balance of $27,255,000.

          Consolidated Liquidity.  During each of the three years in the
          ----------------------
     period ended December 31, 1995, the Company operated profitably and in
     the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, net cash was provided from
     operations.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, in spite of
     increased earnings, net cash was used for operations, principally as a
     result of payments made in connection with a reinsurance transaction.

          In June 1995, the Company purchased a 46.4% common stock interest
     in MK Gold for an aggregate cash purchase price of $22,500,000.  In
     addition, the Company purchased at par all of a lender's interest
     under a $20,000,000 revolving credit facility with MK Gold, of which
     $15,000,000 was outstanding.  This amount was repaid during the third
     quarter of 1995.

          During the second quarter of 1995, the Company purchased
     2,365,200 common shares of RCP for approximately $11,130,000, which
     increased its equity interest in RCP to 2,714,000 shares (7.1%).  RCP
     is a real estate investment trust, the principal asset of which is a
     $1.3 billion collateralized loan to the owners of the land and
     buildings known as Rockefeller Center in New York City.  In March
     1996, shareholders of RCP approved a merger transaction pursuant to
     which shareholders will receive $8.00 per share.  If the merger is
     consummated, the Company expects to report a pre-tax gain of
     approximately $8,900,000 in 1996.

          In July 1995, pursuant to the chapter 11 reorganization plan of
     HFC, the Company acquired 41.2% of HFC's common stock for a net cash
     investment of approximately $4,200,000.  As part of the reorganization
     plan, the Company provided HFC with a $20,000,000 eight year secured
     loan, which is convertible into additional shares of HFC common stock
     after three years (subject to certain conditions) and which bears
     interest at the rate of 12% per year.

     The Company has entered into a letter of intent with PepsiCo, Inc. for the
     formation of a joint venture (the "JV") that will be the exclusive bottler
     and distributor of PepsiCo beverages in a large portion of eastern Russia,
     Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. The Company has agreed to invest approximately
     $79,000,000 in the JV, for which it will receive a 75% economic interest.

                                       24

     It is currently anticipated that the joint venture agreement will be
     executed during the second quarter of 1996.

          The Company's investments in Russia and Argentina are subject to
     foreign exchange and other risks.  Investing in the emerging markets
     of Russia is subject to political risk and uncertainty concerning the
     government's ability to succeed in its program to convert to a market
     economy, both of which are beyond the Company's control.  In
     Argentina, the Company's investment is subject to the foreign currency
     exchange risk of a devaluation of the Argentine peso against the
     United States dollar, which the Argentine government has indicated is
     not being considered, the volatility of the Argentine banking system,
     the overall health of the Argentine economy and the usual competitive
     factors experienced by insurance companies.

          The source of the funds for the investments described above is
     general corporate funds available to the Parent company.

          Effective as of December 31, 1995, control of the WMAC Companies
     was returned to the Company and such subsidiaries were consolidated. 
     As a result, the Company recorded a gain of $41,030,000, representing
     the difference between the carrying amount of the Company's investment
     prior to consolidation and the net assets of such subsidiaries.

          The investment portfolios of the Company's insurance subsidiaries
     are principally fixed maturity investments rated "investment grade" or
     U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although
     limited investments in "non rated" or rated less than "investment
     grade" securities have been made from time to time.  The investment
     strategy of the insurance subsidiaries has been to maintain a high
     quality portfolio of publicly traded, fixed income securities with a
     relatively short duration.  Principally as a result of decreases in
     market interest rates during 1995, the unrealized loss on investments
     at the end of 1994 of approximately $41,309,000 (net of taxes) became
     an unrealized gain of approximately $30,086,000 (net of taxes) as of
     December 31, 1995.  While this has resulted in an increase in
     shareholders' equity, it had no effect on results of operations or
     cash flows.

          As a result of significant losses from natural disasters suffered
     by the property and casualty insurance industry in recent years, the
     Company has seen a notable decrease in the availability of reinsurance
     at reasonable rates, particularly at low levels of deductibility.  The
     Company's insurance subsidiaries also suffered certain of such losses,
     although catastrophe reinsurance programs substantially reduced the
     economic losses in 1994.  As a result of increased reinsurance rates,
     in 1995 the Company raised its retention of lower level losses from
     $11,000,000 to $15,000,000.  The Company has benefited from a modest
     decline in reinsurance rates for its 1996 catastrophe reinsurance
     program and has not adjusted its retention of lower level losses.

          In December 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with the
     California Department of Insurance to settle its Proposition 103
     liability for $17,700,000.  The settlement did not exceed reserves
     established in prior years.  The Company paid the settlement amount
     during the first quarter of 1996.

          The Company provides collateralized automobile loans to
     individuals with poor credit histories.  In 1995, primarily as a
     result of increased competition together with the Company's
     unwillingness to lower its underwriting standards and interest rate
     charges, the loan portfolio did not grow at the rate previously
     experienced.  Additionally, loan losses have increased but remain less
     than the 6.6% reserve maintained on this portfolio.  The Company
     expects that the increased level of competition will continue, and,
     together with the Company's unwillingness to lower rates, is likely to
     result in a contraction in the size of this portfolio in the future. 
     The Company's investment in these loans was $134,668,000, $129,512,000
     and $73,321,000 at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

          The Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Phlcorp
     and its subsidiaries, have substantial loss carryforwards and other
     tax attributes (as more fully discussed in the Notes to Consolidated
     Financial Statements).  The amount and availability of tax loss
     carryforwards are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and
     uncertainties, including, with respect to Phlcorp and its
     subsidiaries, tax sharing payments pursuant to a tax settlement
     agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of
     Justice.  In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in
     ownership could impose limitations on the use of these carryforwards,
     the Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions which
     generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating
     at least five percent of the Common Shares and the ability of persons
     or entities now owning at least five percent of the Common Shares from
     acquiring additional Common Shares.  The Company has recognized as an
     asset (net of reserves) certain of the benefits of such loss
     carryforwards and other tax attributes.  However, the amount of the
     asset recognized only reflects the minimum Phlcorp tax loss
     carryforwards and is based, in part, on certain proposed regulations
     affecting the use of Phlcorp's tax loss carryforwards.  As described
     in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, significant
     additional amounts may be available under certain circumstances.

     Results of Operations
     ---------------------

          The Company's most significant operations are its insurance
     businesses, where it is a specialty markets provider of property and
     casualty and life insurance to its niche markets.  For the year ended
     December 31, 1995, the Company's insurance segments contributed 78% of
     total revenues and, at December 31, 1995, constituted 77% of total
     assets.

          Earned premium revenues and commissions of the property and
     casualty insurance operations of the Empire Group were $326,100,000 in
     1995, $299,200,000 in 1994 and $259,400,000 in 1993.  The increase in
     1995 principally was attributable to growth in policies in force and
     increased premium rates, while the increase in 1994 resulted from
     increased policies in force.  The majority of the growth in each of
     1995 and 1994 resulted from acquired blocks of assigned risk business
     from other insurance companies.

          Earned premium revenues of the Colonial Penn P&C Group were
     approximately $490,500,000 in 1995, $447,200,000 in 1994 and
     $452,600,000 in 1993.  The growth in earned premiums in 1995
     principally resulted from acquired blocks of assigned risk automobile
     business from other insurance companies and a modest increase in
     earned premiums related to voluntary automobile policies.  Voluntary
     automobile policies in force at December 31, 1995 were almost 1%
     greater than the prior year end, and written premiums increased 5.7%
     from 1994.  When the Colonial Penn P&C Group was acquired in 1991, the
     Company substantially reduced its existing marketing programs, which
     the Company believes were not justified by prior operating results,
     and instituted new low cost direct marketing methods.  Prior to 1995,
     this strategy resulted in declining polices in force and earned
     premiums, as new business was not sufficient to offset the normal
     attrition of existing business.  The Company believes that new
     business generated in 1996 will continue to exceed lapsed business and
     the rate of growth in policies in force will also increase, although
     there can be no assurance that this will be achieved.  Earned premiums
     in 1994 also reflect an increase, as compared to the prior year,
     resulting from acquired blocks of automobile assigned risk business
     from other insurance companies.

          The Company's property and casualty insurance operations combined
     ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were as follows:
     

             Year Ended December 31,         GAAP      SAP 
             -----------------------         ----      ---
                    1995                    103.5%   101.2%
                    1994                     99.1%    98.8%
                    1993                     96.9%    93.7%


          The provision for insurance losses and policy benefits includes
     catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, estimated at
     approximately $4,600,000, $18,300,000 and $10,900,000 for the years
     ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The 1994 losses
     include approximately $11,700,000 related to the Northridge,
     California earthquake.

          The increase in the combined ratios is primarily attributable to
     the Empire Group, which strengthened reserves in automobile and
     workers compensation lines by approximately $34,470,000.  Actuarial
     studies conducted during 1995 have identified revised loss development
     patterns in automobile lines, which may indicate greater ultimate loss
     experience than previously expected.  The Empire Group also reopened
     closed no-fault claims files during 1995 and made additional payments
     on prior years' claims.  This, along with changes in claim handling
     practices, have increased the difficultly of estimating ultimate losses,
     and actual losses may be different than the studies indicated. 
     However, the Empire Group strengthened reserves to the levels
     indicated in the actuarial studies.  The Empire Group will continue to
     analyze loss development patterns on a quarterly basis and will
     evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves.

          The combined ratios for the Colonial Penn P&C Group increased
     slightly in 1995 as compared to 1994.  The 1995 combined ratios
     reflect higher losses related to acquired blocks of automobile
     assigned risk business that are partially offset by increased service
     fee income.  In addition, the combined ratios in 1995 were favorably
     affected by reduced catastrophe losses as compared to 1994.  The
     combined ratios of the Colonial Penn P&C Group's core line of
     business, voluntary auto, were essentially unchanged.   The Colonial
     Penn P&C Group believes that its strong underwriting procedures,
     emphasis on mature adult insureds, prior rate increases and claims
     handling and settlement practices have enabled it to record combined
     ratios that compare favorably with the industry.

          In addition to higher catastrophe losses, the combined ratios for
     1994 increased as compared to 1993 principally due to settlements in
     1993 of Colonial Penn P&C Group prior years' claims at amounts less
     than provided.

          Premium revenue receipts on IOP products of the life insurance
     subsidiaries (which are not reflected as revenues) were $50,202,000 in
     1995, $108,080,000 in 1994 and $88,312,000 in 1993.  The principal IOP
     product sold during the three year period ended December 31, 1995 was
     a VA product marketed directly to consumers.  The Company believes the
     decline in premium revenue receipts of the VA product is due to a
     combination of factors, including the public's perception of potential
     tax law changes, increased competition and the performance of the
     fund manager.

          Earned premium revenues of the life and health insurance
     operations were $165,800,000 for 1995, $172,400,000 for 1994 and
     $181,800,000 for 1993.  The decline in earned premium revenues reflect
     the run-off of the agent sold Medicare supplement business, which the
     Company ceased marketing at December 31, 1992 due to inadequate
     profitability.



                                       27

          Earned premiums revenues for the Company's Graded Benefit Life
     business were $117,700,000, $113,700,000 and $109,800,000 for the
     years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The
     growth in earned premiums reflects the Company's increased marketing
     efforts with respect to this product, which have been conducted at
     acquisition cost levels that result in adequate profitability.

          Insurance losses, policy benefits and amortization of deferred
     acquisition costs of the life and health insurance operations were
     $133,200,000, $138,300,000 and $179,100,000 for the years ended
     December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The decrease in 1995
     reflects the run-off of the agent sold Medicare supplement business,
     which had less favorable loss experience in 1995, reduced IOP
     insurance in force and a $3,500,000 gain recognized from the
     termination of a reinsurance agreement.  The decrease in 1995 was
     partially offset by the growth of the Graded Benefit Life product. 
     The decrease in 1994 as compared to the prior year primarily reflects
     the run-off of the agent sold Medicare supplement business and certain
     non-recurring transactions in 1993 which are described below.

          In 1993, due to expectations of decreased or inadequate future
     profitability of its Single Premium Whole Life ("SPWL") products, the
     Company reinsured its SPWL business and recorded a net pre-tax gain of
     approximately $16,700,000.  Such net pre-tax gain consists of the
     premium received on the transaction of $19,500,000, which is reflected
     as a credit in the caption "Provision for insurance losses and policy
     benefits," and net security gains on investments sold in connection
     with the transaction of $24,100,000, reduced by the write-off of
     deferred policy acquisition costs of $26,900,000.

          During 1993, the Company reinvested proceeds from sales of
     certain securities at the lower prevailing interest rates.  Since
     these reinvestment rates were, in certain instances, lower than had
     previously been expected on certain fixed rate annuity policies, the
     Company recorded an additional provision for insurance losses of
     $6,800,000.

          Manufacturing revenues decreased in 1995 principally due to
     reduced demand from customers of the bathroom vanities division and a
     factory fire at the fibers division, offset in part by increased sales
     at the plastics division.  The decrease in manufacturing gross profit
     in 1995 principally reflects the decrease in manufacturing sales,
     increased raw material costs at most divisions and the fire at the
     fibers division.  Although manufacturing revenues increased in 1994 as
     compared to 1993, gross profit declined significantly, principally at
     the bathroom vanities division, which experienced manufacturing
     inefficiencies, pricing pressures and recorded provisions for obsolete
     inventory in 1994.

          As a result of the factory fire at the fibers division and
     historical operating losses, in the fourth quarter of 1995 the Company
     decided to close the factory and recorded a loss of approximately
     $6,200,000 for shutdown expenses.  In addition, during the third
     quarter of 1995, the Company sold a division that manufactured office
     furnishing systems and recognized a loss of $1,100,000.  Such losses
     are reflected in the caption "Selling, general and other expenses."

          Finance revenues reflect the level of consumer instalment loans,
     which have increased during 1995 and 1994 as discussed above.  The
     operating profit applicable to this segment did not change
     significantly in 1995 as compared to 1994, principally due to
     increased interest expense on customer banking deposits and greater
     losses on automobile loans.

          Investment and other income increased in 1995 principally due to
     the return of the WMAC Companies, which resulted in a gain of
     $41,030,000 as discussed above.  Interest and dividend income
     increased in 1995 reflecting higher investment yields and increased
     funds available for investment.  Investment and other income reflects
     increased fee income in 1995 related to acquired blocks of automobile
     assigned risk business.
                                       28

          Investment and other income in 1994 includes $8,458,000 related
     to the disposition of El Salvador government bonds and $14,490,000
     related to the sale of the Company's remaining shares in Bolivian
     Power Company.  Investment and other income in 1993 includes a
     $12,981,000 gain from the sale of a portion of the investment in
     Bolivian Power Company.

          Net securities gains (losses) were $20,027,000, ($12,004,000) and
     $51,923,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
     respectively.  Realized security losses during 1994 principally
     reflected the Company's strategy to further shorten the duration of
     its investment portfolio during a time of rising interest rates. 
     Security gains in 1993 were realized, in part, to effect the
     reinsurance and transfer of the SPWL business described above.

          Higher interest expense in each of 1995 and 1994 compared to the
     prior year principally reflects the increased level of outstanding
     debt.  Interest expense also reflects the increased level of deposits
     at AIB and AIF and an increase in rates related to those deposits. 
     Generally, interest rates on deposits are lower than on other
     available funds.  Interest expense on deposits was $12,034,000 in
     1995, $8,304,000 in 1994 and $9,001,000 in 1993.

          The increase in selling, general and other expenses in 1995
     principally reflects the losses recorded by the manufacturing segment
     as described above, operating expenses of real estate properties
     acquired during 1994, expenses relating to certain investing
     activities, including expenses related to exploring opportunities in
     Russia, and increased provisions for bad debts at the banking and
     lending segment.

          During each of the last three years, statistical studies and
     estimates of service costs indicated that the recorded liability for
     unredeemed trading stamps was in excess of the amount that ultimately
     would be required to redeem trading stamps outstanding.  As a result,
     selling, general and other expenses applicable to the trading stamp
     operations include credits of $9,400,000, $11,700,000 and $11,900,000
     for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively,
     reflecting adjustments made to the liability for unredeemed trading
     stamps.  The Company's most recent analysis of the liability for
     unredeemed trading stamps has not identified any remaining excess as
     of December 31, 1995.

          The provision for income taxes for 1995 is below the expected
     normal corporate income tax rate principally due to the gain related
     to the return of the WMAC Companies, which is not taxable, and the
     favorable resolution of certain contingencies.  The provision for
     income taxes for 1994 and 1993 is below the expected normal corporate
     income tax rate principally because of a reduction in the valuation
     allowance applicable to the deferred tax asset due to the resolution
     of certain contingencies.  In addition, the provision for income taxes
     for 1993 was reduced by approximately $4,215,000 as a result of
     changes in federal income tax rates.

          The number of shares used to calculate primary earnings per share
     was 59,271,000, 58,202,000 and 58,539,000 for 1995, 1994 and 1993,
     respectively.  The number of shares used to calculate fully diluted
     earnings per share was 62,807,000, 61,715,000 and 61,486,000 for 1995,
     1994 and 1993, respectively.  The increase in the number of shares
     utilized in calculating per share amounts in 1995 principally relates
     to the exercise of previously granted warrants to the Company's
     Chairman and President, the selling of such shares in an underwritten
     public offering and the exercise by the underwriters of the over
     allotment option, all as discussed above.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



To the Board of Directors of Leucadia National Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedules of LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES listed in
Item 14(a) of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of LEUCADIA NATIONAL
CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects,
the information required to be included therein.

As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993 the
Company changed its method of accounting for Income Taxes, Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions, Postemployment Benefits, Multiple-Year
Retrospectively Rated Contracts, and Certain Investments in Debt and Capital
Securities, all as set forth in various pronouncements of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board and the Emerging Issues Task Force.

LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Nature of Operations:
    ---------------------
The Company is a diversified financial services holding company engaged in
personal and commercial lines of property and casualty insurance, life and
health insurance, banking and lending and manufacturing, principally in markets
throughout the United States. The Company's principal operations are its
insurance businesses, where it is a specialty markets provider of property and
casualty and life insurance products to niche markets. The Company's principal
personal lines insurance products are automobile insurance, homeowners
insurance, graded benefit life insurance marketed primarily to the age
50-and-over population and variable annuity products. The Company's principal
commercial lines are property and casualty products provided for multi-family
residential real estate, retail establishments and livery vehicles in the New
York metropolitan area.

The Company's banking and lending operations principally consist of making
instalment loans primarily funded by deposits insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Company. The Company's manufacturing operations primarily manufacture
products for the "do-it-yourself" home improvement market and for industrial and
agricultural markets.

2.  Significant Accounting Policies:
    --------------------------------
(a) Use of Estimates in Preparing Financial Statements: The preparation of
    --------------------------------------------------
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

(b) Consolidation Policy: The consolidated financial statements include the
    --------------------
accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. Two of the
Company's legal subsidiaries (the "WMAC Companies") were not consolidated while
under the control of the Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner. Effective as of
December 31, 1995, control of the WMAC Companies was returned to the Company and
such subsidiaries are included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 1995.

Investments in entities in which the Company owns less than 50% of the voting
interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for
on the equity method of accounting.

Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to be consistent with
the 1995 presentation.

(c) Stock Split:  On November 15, 1995, a two-for-one stock split was effected
    -----------
in the form of a 100% stock dividend.  The financial statements (and notes

                                       F-7

<PAGE>



2.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
    -------------------------------
thereto) give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods presented.

(d) Statements of Cash Flows: The Company considers short-term investments,
    ------------------------
which have maturities of less than three months at the time of acquisition, to
be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments of
$199,725,000 and $200,232,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

On June 1, 1993, the Company received 448,350 of the Company's Common Shares
(valued at $8,294,000) in settlement of a zero coupon note due from John W.
Jordan II, a former director of the Company. The value of the shares received,
which was based on the market price on the date of the transaction, was equal to
the maturity value of the note.

(e) Investments: Effective as of December 31, 1993, the Company adopted
    -----------
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"). The adoption of SFAS
115 resulted in an increase in reported shareholders' equity of $49,500,000 at
December 31, 1993.

At acquisition, marketable debt and equity securities are designated as either
i) held to maturity, which are carried at amortized cost, ii) trading, which are
carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in
results of operations, or iii) available for sale, which are carried at
estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a separate
component of shareholders' equity, net of taxes. Held to maturity investments
are made with the intention of holding such securities to maturity, which the
Company has the ability to do. Estimated fair values are principally based on
quoted market prices.

Investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary
are written down to estimated net realizable values. The writedowns are included
in "Net securities gains (losses)" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
cost of securities sold is based on average cost.

The Company's investments in Russian equity securities ($39,700,000 and
$19,600,000 as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively), none of which is
held by its insurance or banking subsidiaries, do not have readily determinable
fair values. Given the uncertainties inherent in investing in the emerging
markets of Russia, the Company is accounting for these investments under the
cost recovery method, whereby all receipts are applied to reduce the investment.
These investments are included in "Other investments" in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

(f) Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements: Property, equipment and
    ----------------------------------------------
leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and
amortization ($101,568,000 and $87,067,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively). Depreciation and amortization are provided principally on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, if less,
the term of the underlying lease.

2.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
    -------------------------------
(g) Income Recognition from Insurance Operations:  Premiums on property and
    --------------------------------------------
casualty and health insurance products are recognized as revenues over the
term of the policy using the monthly pro rata basis.

Premiums for investment oriented insurance products ("IOP products") are
reflected in a manner similar to a deposit; revenues reflect only mortality
charges and other amounts assessed against the holder of the insurance policies
and annuity contracts. The principal IOP product offered during the three year
period ended December 31, 1995 was a variable annuity ("VA") product. Other life
premiums are recognized as revenues over the premium paying period.

Premiums for the VA product are directed by the policyholder to be invested in a
unit trust solely for the benefit and risk of the policyholder. Policyholders'
accounts are charged for the cost of insurance provided, administrative and
certain other charges. The amount included in the balance sheet liability
caption "Separate and variable accounts" represents the current value of the
policyholders' funds.

(h) Policy Acquisition Costs: Policy acquisition costs principally consist of
    ------------------------
direct response marketing costs, commissions, premium taxes and other
underwriting expenses (net of reinsurance allowances). If recoverability of such
costs from future premiums and related investment income is not anticipated, the
amounts not considered recoverable are charged to operations. Deferred policy
acquisition costs also have been charged to operations in connection with
dispositions of blocks of business or reinvestment of proceeds from security
sales at prevailing lower interest rates.

Policy acquisition costs applicable to the property and casualty insurance
operations are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms of the related
policies. Policy acquisition costs applicable to IOP products are deferred and
amortized as a level percentage of the present value of expected gross profits
over the estimated life of each policy. Policy acquisition costs applicable to
other life insurance products are amortized over the expected premium paying
period of the policies.

(i) Reinsurance: In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce
    -----------
the loss that may arise from catastrophes and to limit losses from large
exposures by reinsuring certain levels of risk with other insurance enterprises.
Catastrophe reinsurance treaties serve to reduce property and casualty insurance
risk in geographic areas where the Company is exposed to natural disasters,
principally Florida, California and the East Coast. The Company has also entered
into reinsurance transactions in connection with dispositions of blocks of
businesses. Reinsurance contracts do not necessarily legally relieve the Company
from its obligations to policyholders.

Reinsurance recoverables are reported as assets net of provisions for
uncollectible amounts. Premiums earned and other underwriting expenses are
stated net of reinsurance.

2.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
    --------------------------------
(j) Policy Reserves and Unearned Premiums: Policy reserves and unearned premiums
    -------------------------------------
for life, health and traditional annuity policies are computed on a net level
premium method based upon standard and Company developed tables with provision
for adverse deviation and estimated withdrawals. Liabilities for unpaid losses
and loss adjustment expenses applicable to the property and casualty insurance
operations are determined using case basis evaluations, statistical analyses for
losses incurred but not reported and estimates for salvage and subrogation
recoverable and represent estimates of ultimate claim costs and loss adjustment
expenses. As more information becomes available and claims are settled, the
estimated liabilities are adjusted upward or downward with the effect of
decreasing or increasing net income at the time of adjustment.

Effective as of January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No. 93-6, "Accounting for
Multiple Year Retrospectively Rated Contracts by Ceding and Assuming
Enterprises" ("EITF 93-6"), which specifies the accounting for certain
retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements. As a result of the adoption of
EITF 93-6, the Company reduced its premium payable at January 1, 1993 by
$14,654,000 and recorded a credit of $9,672,000 (net of income taxes of
$4,982,000) which is included in the caption "Cumulative effects of changes in
accounting principles."

(k) Liability for Unredeemed Trading Stamps: The Company's liability for
    ---------------------------------------
unredeemed trading stamps is estimated based upon recent experience, statistical
evaluation and estimated costs to service redemptions of unredeemed trading
stamps in the future. Recent statistical studies and current estimates of
service costs have indicated that the recorded liability for unredeemed trading
stamps was in excess of the amount that ultimately will be required to redeem
trading stamps outstanding. As a result, selling, general and other expenses
applicable to the trading stamp operations include credits of $9,400,000,
$11,700,000 and $11,900,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively, reflecting the adjustments made to the liability for
unredeemed trading stamps. The Company's most recent analysis of the liability
for unredeemed trading stamps has not identified any remaining excess as of
December 31, 1995.

(l) Pension, Postemployment and Postretirement Costs: The Company has
    ------------------------------------------------
non-contributory trusteed pension plans covering certain employees, which
generally provide retirement benefits based on salary and length of service. The
plans are funded in amounts sufficient to satisfy minimum ERISA funding
requirements.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than
Pensions" ("SFAS 106") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" ("SFAS 112"), which require
accruals for benefits that previously had been expensed as incurred. The Company
does not expect SFAS 106 and SFAS 112 to have a material effect on results of
operations.

2.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
    --------------------------------
(m) Income Taxes: The Company provides for income taxes using the liability
    ------------
method. Effective as of January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS
109"). Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are provided at the
statutorily enacted rates for differences between the tax and accounting bases
of substantially all assets and liabilities and for carryforwards. The future
benefit of certain tax loss carryforwards and future deductions is recorded as
an asset and the provisions for income taxes are not reduced for the benefit
from utilization of tax loss carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if
deferred tax assets are not considered more likely than not to be realized.

(n) Derivative Financial Instruments: The Company has entered into interest rate
    --------------------------------
swap and interest rate option agreements to reduce the impact of changes in
interest rates on its variable rate debt. The difference between the amounts
paid and received is accrued as an adjustment to interest expense over the term
of the agreements. The premiums paid for interest rate option agreements are
included in other assets and are amortized to expense over the term of the
agreements. The Company does not have material derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.

(o) Translation of Foreign Currency:  Foreign currency denominated investments
    -------------------------------
which are not subject to hedging agreements and currency rate swap agreements 
not meeting the accounting requirements for hedges are converted into U.S. 
dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the period.  Resulting net 
exchange gains or losses were not material.

(p) Recently Issued Accounting Standards: Effective January 1, 1996, Statement
    ------------------------------------
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" ("SFAS 121"),
will require the Company to review the recoverability of the carrying amount of
long-lived assets and recognize an impairment loss under certain circumstances.
The impact of implementation of SFAS 121 on the Company's financial position and
results of operations is not expected to be material.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), which is effective January 1, 1996, establishes a
fair value method for accounting for stock-based compensation plans, either
through recognition in the statement of operations or disclosure. The Company
expects to implement SFAS 123 by providing the required disclosures in the notes
to the financial statements.

3.  Acquisitions:
    -------------
The Company is a partner in The Jordan Company and Jordan/Zalaznick Capital
Company, private investment firms whose principal activity is structuring
leveraged buy-outs in which the partners are given the opportunity to become
equity participants. John W. Jordan II, a former director of the Company, is a
Managing Partner of both firms. Since 1982, through such partnerships, the
Company acquired interests in several companies (the "Jordan Associated
Companies"), principally engaged in various aspects of manufacturing and
distribution. The Company currently accounts for its interests in the Jordan
Associated Companies on the cost method of accounting. The investments

3.  Acquisitions, continued:
    ------------
acquired as a result of the partnership interests are considered Associated
Companies.

In April 1994, the Company acquired a 30% interest in Caja de Ahorro y Seguro
S.A. ("Caja") from the government of Argentina for a purchase price of
$46,000,000, including costs. Caja is a holding company whose subsidiaries are
engaged in property and casualty insurance, life insurance and banking in
Argentina. The difference between the Company's investment in Caja and its share
of Caja's underlying net tangible assets is being amortized over 20 years.

In May 1994, the Company acquired a 615,000 square foot office building located
near Grand Central Terminal in New York City for $50,800,000. The building has
355,000 square feet of contiguous space available for occupancy. After certain
improvements to the building are completed, the Company intends to lease the
available space to one or more entities and/or sell the building. The investment
is included in other assets.

In July 1994, the Company acquired two luxury condominium towers in downtown San
Diego, California for $42,000,000. The property includes 201 residential units,
of which 162 were available for sale at December 31, 1995, and 42,000 square
feet of retail space. The investment is included in other assets.

In June 1995, the Company purchased a 46.4% common stock interest in MK Gold
Company ("MK Gold") for an aggregate cash purchase price of $22,500,000. In
addition, the Company purchased at par all of a lender's interest under a
$20,000,000 revolving credit facility with MK Gold, of which $15,000,000 was
outstanding. This amount was repaid during the third quarter of 1995. MK Gold is
an international gold mining company whose shares are quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market System.

In July 1995, pursuant to the chapter 11 reorganization of HomeFed Corporation
("HFC"), the Company acquired 41.2% of HFC's common stock for a net cash
investment of approximately $4,200,000. As part of the reorganization plan, the
Company provided HFC with a $20,000,000 eight year secured loan, which is
convertible into additional shares of HFC common stock after three years
(subject to certain conditions) and which bears interest at the rate of 12% per
year. HFC is a public company whose subsidiaries develop real property.

The Company accounts for its investments in Caja, MK Gold and HFC under the
equity method of accounting based on fiscal periods ended three months prior to
the end of the Company's reporting period. The Company's investments in Caja, MK
Gold and HFC are included in the caption "Investments in associated companies."

4.  Investments in Associated Companies:
    -----------------------------------
The Company owns or held part interests in the following foreign power
companies:  Compania de Alumbrado Electrico de San Salvador, S.A. ("CAESS"),

CAESS's assets, the Company received cash of $5,300,000 and $12,000,000
principal amount of 6% U.S. dollar denominated El Salvador Government bonds due
in instalments through 1996. The Company has recognized the gain on the cash
basis. During 1994, the Company disposed of the remaining bonds and reported a
pre-tax gain of $8,458,000, which is included in the caption "Investment and
other income." Gains recognized in 1993 were not significant.

On June 23, 1993, the Company reinsured substantially all of its existing single
premium whole life business ("SPWL") with a subsidiary of John Hancock Mutual
Life Insurance Company ("John Hancock"), and realized a net pre-tax gain of
approximately $16,700,000. Such net pre-tax gain consists of the premium
received on the transaction of approximately $19,500,000, which is reflected as
a credit in the caption "Provision for insurance losses and policy benefits,"
and net security gains on investments sold in connection with the transaction of
$24,100,000, reduced by the write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs of
$26,900,000. For financial reporting purposes, the Company reflects the policy
liabilities assumed by John Hancock in policy reserves, with an offsetting
receivable from John Hancock of the same amount in reinsurance receivable, net,
until the Company is legally relieved of its obligation to the SPWL
policyholders. At December 31, 1995, reinsurance receivables, net includes
$141,084,000 due from John Hancock.

5.  Insurance Operations, continued:
    --------------------
During 1993, the Company sold, at gains, substantial amounts of investments,
including dispositions in connection with the transfer of blocks of business,
and, in certain cases, reinvested proceeds at prevailing lower interest rates.
Since certain of these rates were lower than had previously been expected on
certain fixed rate annuity policies, the Company recorded an additional
provision for insurance losses of $6,800,000.

The effect of reinsurance on premiums written and earned for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 is as follows (in thousands):

</TABLE>

The statutory net income (loss) of the life insurance subsidiaries is net of
certain management and other fees paid to the Company or other subsidiaries of
the Company. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the reported income
of the life insurance segment is increased by these fees, since all intercompany
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Certain insurance subsidiaries are owned by other insurance subsidiaries. In the
data above, investments in such subsidiary-owned insurance companies are
reflected in statutory surplus of both the parent and subsidiary-owned insurance
company. As a result, at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, statutory surplus of
$292,800,000, $252,800,000 and $246,600,000, respectively, related to property

and casualty operations is also included in the statutory surplus of the life
insurance parent, and statutory surplus of $29,300,000, $35,900,000 and
$42,200,000, respectively, related to life operations is also included in the
statutory surplus of the property and casualty insurance parent. The insurance
subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions which limit the amount of
cash and other distributions available to the Company without regulatory
approval. At December 31, 1995, $52,167,000 could be distributed to the Company
without regulatory approval.

In December 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with the California
Department of Insurance to settle its Proposition 103 liability for $17,700,000.
The settlement did not exceed reserves established in prior years. The Company
paid the settlement amount during the first quarter of 1996.

The Company's insurance subsidiaries are contingently liable for possible
assessments under state regulatory requirements pertaining to potential
insolvencies of unaffiliated insurance companies. Liabilities, which are
established based upon regulatory guidance, have not been material.

reserves, see "Reconciliation of Liability for Losses and Loss Adjustment
Expenses" in Item 1 included elsewhere herein, which is incorporated by

Credit agreements provide for aggregate contractual credit facilities of
$150,000,000 and bear interest based on the prime rate or LIBOR, plus commitment
and other fees. Such credit facilities were renewed in 1994 and expire in June
1997. No amounts were borrowed under these facilities as of December 31, 1995
and 1994. The term loans with banks also bear interest based on the prime rate
or LIBOR.

In June 1995, the Company sold $100,000,000 principal amount of its newly
authorized 8 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2005 in an underwritten public
offering.

Approximately $9,525,000 of the manufacturing division's net property, equipment
and leasehold improvements are pledged as collateral for the Industrial Revenue
Bonds; and approximately $12,716,000 of other assets (primarily property) are
pledged for other indebtedness aggregating approximately $7,585,000.

Interest rate swap and interest rate option agreements are used to reduce the
potential impact of increases in interest rates on term loans with banks,
customer banking deposits and credit agreement borrowings. Under the interest
rate swap agreements, the Company has agreed with other parties to pay fixed
rate interest amounts and receive variable rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to an agreed notional amount. The variable interest rate portion of
the swaps is a specified LIBOR interest rate. Swaps that expire in 1996 require
fixed rate payments of 7.23% on a $50,000,000 notional amount. Swaps that expire
in 1999 require fixed rate payments of 7.33% on a $25,000,000 notional amount.
The weighted average LIBOR rate at December 31, 1995 is 5.8%. Changes in LIBOR
interest rates in the future will change the amounts to be received under the
agreements as well as interest to be paid under the related variable debt
obligations.

In 1994, the Company purchased an option for $2,564,000 to enter into an
interest rate swap, which is exercisable in August 1996. If exercised, the
Company would be required to make fixed rate payments of 7.64% in exchange for
receiving a LIBOR based variable payment on a $50,000,000 notional amount for
the subsequent eight year term.

Counterparties to interest rate swap agreements are major financial
institutions, which management believes are able to fulfill their obligations.
However, any losses due to default by the counterparties are likely to be
immaterial.

During 1989, the Company entered into long-term hedging transactions whereby
substantially all currency rate risk related to the Swiss Franc Bonds was
eliminated and the cost of which increased the cost of the issue to
approximately 10.4%.

The 5 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2003 are convertible into
Common Shares at $28.75 per Common Share, an aggregate of 3,478,261 Common
Shares, subject to anti-dilution provisions.

The most restrictive of the Company's debt instruments require maintenance of
minimum Tangible Net Worth and limit Indebtedness, as defined in the agreements.
In addition, the debt instruments contain limitations on dividends, investments,
liens, contingent obligations and certain other matters. As of January 1, 1996,
cash dividends of $346,100,000 could be paid under the most restrictive
covenants.

The aggregate annual mandatory redemptions of debt during the five year period

$2,134; 1998 - $2,106; 1999 - $51,663; and, 2000 - $31,975.

The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings (primarily customer
banking deposits) was 6.1% and 5.4% at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

11.  Common Shares, Stock Options, Warrants and Preferred Shares:
     -----------------------------------------------------------
The Board of Directors from time to time has authorized acquisitions of the
Company's Common Shares. Pursuant to such authorization, during the three year
period ended December 31, 1995, the Company acquired 618,066 Common Shares
(29,276 shares in 1995, 23,972 shares in 1994 and 564,818 shares in 1993) at an
average price of $19.39 per Common Share. The Common Shares acquired in 1993
include 448,350 Common Shares acquired from John W. Jordan II.

The options were granted under plans that provide for the issuance of stock
options and stock appreciation rights at not less than the fair market value of
the underlying stock at the date the options or rights are granted. Options
granted under these plans generally become exercisable in five equal annual
instalments starting one year from date of grant. No stock appreciation rights
have been granted.

At December 31, 1995 and 1994, options to purchase 443,018 and 553,868 Common
Shares, respectively, were exercisable.

On September 13, 1995, Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, Chairman of the
Board and President of the Company, respectively, and certain members of Mr.
Cumming's family exercised previously granted warrants to purchase an aggregate
of 3,188,000 Common Shares and sold such shares in an underwritten public
offering. In connection with such public offering, the Company granted the
underwriters an over allotment option, which was exercised, for 478,200 Common

Shares. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company was required to
pay expenses of the sale, other than underwriting discounts. As a result of the
exercise of the warrants and the exercise of the over allotment option, the
Company realized aggregate cash proceeds, net of expenses, of $43,736,000. For
income tax purposes, the exercise of the warrants results in a current income
tax deduction of $57,305,000. For financial reporting purposes, the benefit of
such deduction ($20,057,000) was credited directly to shareholders' equity.

Effective as of December 31, 1995, control of the WMAC Companies was returned to
the Company and such subsidiaries were consolidated. The gain related to the
return of the WMAC Companies reflects the difference between the carrying amount
of the Company's investment prior to consolidation and the net assets of such
subsidiaries.

Taxes, other than income or payroll, included in operations amounted to
$36,978,000 (including $21,687,000 of premium taxes) for the year ended December
31, 1995, $37,310,000 (including $21,330,000 of premium taxes) for the year
ended December 31, 1994 and $36,839,000 (including $21,295,000 of premium taxes)
for the year ended December 31, 1993.

Advertising costs amounted to $13,079,000, $12,541,000 and $10,394,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

</TABLE>

The valuation allowance principally relates to certain acquired tax loss
carryforwards, the usage of which is subject to certain limitations and certain
other matters which may restrict their availability, and unrealized capital
losses.

In addition, the amounts reflected above are based on the minimum tax loss
carryforwards of Phlcorp, Inc. ("Phlcorp") and certain proposed regulations
affecting the use of Phlcorp's tax loss carryforwards. As described more fully
herein, substantial additional amounts may be available under certain
circumstances and as uncertainties are resolved. If these uncertainties are
resolved in the Company's favor, the deferred tax asset related to tax loss
carryforwards would increase by approximately $79,000,000, exclusive of any
additional valuation allowance.

The Company believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax
asset will be realized principally from taxable income generated by profitable
operations.

December 31, 1995 was as follows (in thousands):

The valuation allowance applicable to the deferred income tax asset recorded
upon adoption of SFAS 109 gave effect to the possible unavailability of certain
income tax deductions. During 1994 and 1993 certain matters were resolved and
the Company reduced the valuation allowance as reflected in the above
reconciliation. Since the WMAC Companies have previously been included in the
Company's consolidated federal income tax return, the gain recorded upon return
of the WMAC Companies is not taxable.

Adoption of SFAS 109 at January 1, 1993 was principally reflected as follows (in

Phlcorp, in connection with its 1986 reorganization, entered into a tax
settlement agreement (the "Tax Settlement Agreement") with the United States
whereby, among other things, Phlcorp agreed that upon utilization of certain
pre-reorganization tax loss carryforwards, it would pay 25% of any resultant tax
savings to the government, subject to certain limitations. The Tax Settlement
Agreement provides that post-reorganization tax attributes and net operating
losses will be utilized prior to pre-reorganization operating losses in
calculating tax sharing payments. Due to unresolved issues concerning certain
post-reorganization deductions, Phlcorp is unable to state with certainty the

amount of its available carryforwards. However, Phlcorp believes that it has
minimum tax operating loss carryforwards of between $93,000,000 and $318,000,000
at December 31, 1995. The expiration dates for Phlcorp's carryforwards will
depend on the outcome of the matters referred to above, although it is unlikely
such carryforwards will begin to expire before 1999.

At December 31, 1995 the Company had tax loss carryforwards, which have been
reflected in the deferred tax asset after applying the statutory federal income
tax rate, as follows (in thousands):

Limitations exist under the tax law which may restrict the utilization of the
Phlcorp carryforwards and the utilization of an aggregate of approximately
$14,842,000 of non-Phlcorp tax loss carryforwards. Further, certain of the
future deductions may only be utilized in the tax returns of certain life
insurance subsidiaries. These limitations are considered in the determination of
the valuation allowance.

Under certain circumstances, the value of the carryforwards available could be
substantially reduced if certain changes in ownership were to occur. In order to
reduce this possibility, the Company's certificate of incorporation was amended
to include certain charter restrictions which prohibit transfers of the
Company's Common Stock under certain circumstances.

Under prior law, Charter National had accumulated $15,447,000 of special federal
income tax deductions allowed life insurance companies and the Colonial Penn
life insurance subsidiaries had accumulated $161,000,000 of such special
deductions. Under certain conditions, such amounts could become taxable in
future periods. Except with respect to amounts applicable to Colonial Penn's
life insurance subsidiaries, the Company does not anticipate any transaction
occurring which would cause these amounts to become taxable. With respect to
Colonial Penn's life insurance subsidiaries, the IRS has asserted that certain
of such special federal income tax deductions should have been reflected in
taxable income in prior years, and has assessed additional taxes (excluding
interest) of $2,899,000 and $19,132,000, for 1989 and 1988, respectively.

Under the terms of the purchase agreement whereby Colonial Penn was acquired
from FPL Group Capital Inc (the "Seller"), the Seller assumed the obligation to
reimburse the Company for any such taxes.

Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the Company complied with the Seller's
instructions and agreed to the 1989 assessment. To date, Seller has failed to
comply with its contractual obligation to reimburse the Company for payment of
the 1989 assessment, the related interest and the loss of certain minimum tax
credit carryforwards, an aggregate of $3,766,000, to which the Company is
entitled under Seller's indemnification. In a response to a legal proceeding
initiated by the Company to collect such amount due under the Seller's
indemnification obligation, the Seller has alleged that the Company has breached
the purchase agreement and, on that basis, Seller has denied liability for the
1989 assessment. The Company believes it has not breached the purchase agreement
and the Seller remains liable for all such taxes and interest. The Seller is
currently exercising its right under the purchase agreement to control the
contest of the 1988 IRS assessment. If the Seller is unsuccessful in contesting
the 1988 IRS assessment, no assurance can be given that the Seller will comply
with its indemnification obligations under the purchase agreement. The Company
intends to enforce its indemnification rights against the Seller and to seek
other relief, including relief for Seller's bad faith.

During 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with the Seller to settle a
lawsuit initiated by the Company to collect certain amounts due from the Seller
under a tax indemnification included in the purchase agreement for other taxable
periods. The settlement required the Seller to pay certain amounts to the
Company, which are reflected in investment and other income for the year ended
December 31, 1995.

The plans' assets consist primarily of U.S. government and agencies' bonds. The
projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1995 and 1994 was determined using
an assumed discount rate of 7.0% and 8.0%, respectively, and an assumed
compensation increase rate of 5.6%. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan
assets was 7.4% at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

The Company also has defined contribution pension plans covering certain
employees. Contributions and costs are a percent of each covered employee's
salary. Amounts charged to expense related to such plans were $2,262,000,
$3,292,000 and $2,066,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

Several subsidiaries provide certain health care and other benefits to certain
retired employees. SFAS 106 and SFAS 112 require companies to accrue the cost of
providing certain postretirement and postemployment benefits during the
employee's period of service. Amounts charged to expense (principally interest)
related to such benefits were $1,679,000 in 1995, $1,762,000 in 1994 and
$2,594,000 in 1993.

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 7% and 8% at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The
assumed health care cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation were between 7.6% and 14.0% for 1995 and 8.4%
and 15% for 1994, declining to an ultimate rate of between 5.0% and 8.0% by
2006.

If the health care cost trend rates were increased by 1%, the accumulated
postretirement obligation as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 would have increased
by $1,317,000 and $1,335,000, respectively. The effect of this change on the
aggregate of service and interest cost for 1995 and 1994 would be immaterial.

In connection with the return of the WMAC Companies, the WMAC Companies have
guaranteed the collectibility of reinsurance agreements applicable to a block of
mortgage reinsurance business. The maximum amount of such contingency is
$42,147,000 at December 31, 1995, which amount has been placed on deposit with a
trustee. The reinsurance agreements are with highly rated institutions and/or
are secured in part by letters of credit or trust funds; as a result the
Company does not expect a material loss in connection with this guarantee.

The insurance and the banking and lending subsidiaries are limited by regulatory
requirements and agreements in the amount of dividends and other transfers of
funds that are available to the Company. Principally as a result of such
restrictions, the net assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on
transfer of funds to the Company were approximately $847,300,000 at December 31,
1995.

18.  Litigation:
     ----------
The Company is subject to various litigation which arises in the course of its
business. Based on discussions with counsel, management is of the opinion that
such litigation will have no material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position of the Company or its consolidated results of operations.

19.  Earnings Per Common Share:
     -------------------------
Earnings per common and dilutive common equivalent share was calculated by
dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of Common Shares
outstanding and the incremental weighted average number of Common Shares
issuable upon exercise of options and warrants for the periods they were
outstanding. The number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares used for
this calculation was 59,271,000 in 1995, 58,202,000 in 1994 and 58,539,000 in
1993.

Fully diluted earnings per share was calculated as described above except that
in 1994 the incremental number of shares utilized the year end market price for
the Company's Common Shares, since the year end market price was above the
average for the year. In addition, the calculations assume the 5 1/4%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures had been converted into Common Shares for
the period they were outstanding and earnings increased for the interest on such
debentures, net of the income tax effect. The number of shares used for this
calculation was 62,807,000 in 1995, 61,715,000 in 1994 and 61,486,000 in 1993.

20.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
     -----------------------------------
The following table presents fair value information about certain financial
instruments, whether or not recognized on the balance sheet. Where quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value
or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by
the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash
flows. The fair value amounts presented do not purport to represent and should
not be considered representative of the underlying "market" or franchise value
of the Company.

20.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments, continued:
     -----------------------------------
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of each class of
the financial instruments described below are as follows:

(a) Investments: The fair values of marketable equity securities and fixed
maturity securities are substantially based on quoted market prices, as
disclosed in Note 6. It is not practicable to determine the fair value of
policyholder loans since such loans generally have no stated maturity, are not
separately transferable and are often repaid by reductions to benefits and
surrenders.

(b)  Cash and cash equivalents:  For cash equivalents, the carrying amount
approximates fair value.

(c) Loans receivable of banking and lending subsidiaries: The fair value of
loans receivable of the banking and lending subsidiaries is estimated by
discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans
would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the same remaining
maturities.

(d) Separate and variable accounts: Separate and variable accounts assets and
liabilities are carried at market value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair
value.

(e) Investments in associated companies: The fair values of a foreign power
company are principally estimated based upon quoted market prices. The carrying
value of the remaining investments in associated companies approximates fair
value.

(f) The WMAC Companies: In 1994, the fair value of the WMAC Companies was
estimated based upon the Company's assessment of the fair value of their
underlying net tangible assets to be received. Effective as of December 31,
1995, the WMAC Companies were returned to the Company and are included in the
consolidated financial statements.

(g) Derivatives: The fair values of derivatives generally reflect the amounts
that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the interest rate and
currency swap contracts.

(h) Customer banking deposits: The fair value of customer banking deposits is
estimated using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining
maturities.

(i) Long-term and other indebtedness: The fair values of non-variable rate debt
are estimated using quoted market prices and estimated rates which would be
available to the Company for debt with similar terms. The fair value of variable
rate debt is estimated to be the carrying amount.

(j) Investment contract reserves: Single premium deferred annuity reserves are
carried at account value, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair
value of other investment contracts is estimated by discounting the future
payments at rates which would currently be offered for contracts with similar
terms.

                                    AGREEMENT
                                    ---------

          AGREEMENT, dated as of May 4, 1995, by and among LEUCADIA
     NATIONAL CORPORATION, a New York corporation ("Employer"), and
     Lawrence S. Hershfield ("Executive").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

          WHEREAS, Executive is employed as Executive Vice President of
     Employer;

          WHEREAS, Employer and Executive have agreed that Executive shall
     relocate for a period to Moscow and shall continue to provide services
     to, and shall continue to be compensated by, Employer (or its
     affiliates);

          WHEREAS, Employer and Executive agree that Executive will work
     and reside in Russia beginning on or about February 1995;

          WHEREAS, Employer and Executive have agreed that Executive will
     serve as President of, and provide services to, a wholly-owned
     subsidiary of Employer ("Leucadia International") to be formed by
     Employer to serve as the vehicle through which investment
     opportunities in Russia and the CIS will be explored and developed; 

          WHEREAS, Executive has determined, based on his own planning
     relating to the anticipated United States and Russian tax consequences
     of his provision of services and residence in Russia, that the proper
     timing of his recognition of compensation income would be beneficial;

          WHEREAS, to address these objectives Employer and Executive
     desire, among other things, to accelerate the taxation and
     deductibility, for United States tax purposes, of certain salary
     otherwise expected to be paid by Employer (or its affiliates) to
     Executive; and

          WHEREAS, contemporaneously herewith Executive and Employer have
     entered into an Escrow and Security agreement (the "Escrow and
     Security Agreement") of even date herewith; 

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good
     and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
     hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties
     hereto agree as follows:

                                       
<PAGE>
<PAGE>


          SECTION ONE. -- ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION.
          ---------------------------------------
 
          Employer hereby agrees to pay to (or for the benefit of)
     Executive, as additional compensation, the sum of $100,000 (the "Fund
     Amount"), upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

          SECTION TWO. -- VESTING IN GENERAL.
          ----------------------------------
 
         Executive's right to receive the Fund Amount shall vest at 100%
     on the first day of the calendar year in which Executive is no longer
     treated as a Russian resident for Russian tax purposes; provided,
     however, Executive's right to receive the Fund Amount shall never vest
     if he is not employed by the Employer or any of its subsidiaries (the
     "Employer Group") as of September 30, 1995.  Notwithstanding the
     preceding sentence, Executive's right to receive the Fund Amount shall
     be 100% vested if Executive dies or becomes disabled prior to
     September 30, 1995, if at the time of such death or disablement,
     Executive was employed by the Employer Group.

          For purposes of this Agreement, any portion of the Fund Amount
     vested pursuant to this Section Two shall be referred to as the
     "Vested Amount."

          SECTION THREE. -- PAYMENT.
          --------------------------

          The Vested Amount shall be paid by Employer to Executive in the
     calendar year ("the Payment Year") immediately following the last
     calendar year in which Executive was treated as a Russian resident for
     Russian tax purposes; provided that without the prior consent of
     Executive no such payment shall be made later than March 31 of the
     Payment Year.

          SECTION FOUR. -- ESCROW ARRANGEMENT.
          -----------------------------------

          The obligations of Employer to Executive hereunder shall be
     implemented and secured by way of the Escrow and Security Agreement. 
     Toward that end, any payment obligation of Employer hereunder shall be
     satisfied, to the extent possible, by directing a release from the
     Escrow Amount (as defined in the Escrow and Security Agreement) of the
     appropriate amount to be paid to Executive.  Such Escrow and Security
     Agreement shall be irrevocable and is intended by the parties to
     secure Employer's obligations to Executive hereunder, and to implement
     such obligations.  As provided in the Escrow and Security Agreement,
     the escrow agent shall be Weil, Gotshal and Manges, the investment of
     the escrow funds shall be directed by the Chief Financial Officer of
     Employer, the income and earnings realized in respect of the escrow 
     fund shall be distributed promptly to Employer, and the tax 
     responsibility for such income and earnings shall be borne by Employer.

                                      
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
          
          SECTION FIVE. -- TAX ELECTION.
          -----------------------------
     
          Executive shall timely and properly file an election under
     Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, in respect of his
     receipt, as compensation, of this Agreement and his interest in the
     escrow established pursuant to the Escrow and Security Agreement. 
     Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Executive's
     failure timely and properly to file such tax election shall result in
     the immediate termination of Employer's obligations hereunder and in a
     termination of the Escrow and Security Agreement, and an immediate
     return to Employer of the escrowed funds deposited by Employer
     pursuant to such Agreement.

          SECTION SIX. -- TAX WITHHOLDING.
          -------------------------------
     
          Executive agrees that Employer and/or its subsidiaries or
     affiliates shall effect all required tax withholdings in respect of
     the additional compensation paid pursuant to this Agreement.  At
     Executive's election, $30,975 (the "Withheld Amount") of the Fund
     Amount shall be applied by the Employer in satisfaction of its
     withholding obligations.  If Executive makes such election, the Escrow
     Agent (as defined in the Escrow and Security Agreement) shall be
     directed to release the Withheld Amount to Employer.  Notwithstanding
     such election, the Withheld Amount shall remain unvested except as
     otherwise provided in Section Two hereof. 

          SECTION SEVEN. -- AFFECT ON OTHER AGREEMENTS
          AND ARRANGEMENTS.                           
          --------------------------------------------
          
          This Agreement shall have no effect on the rights and obligations
     of the parties hereto under any other agreement.  Notwithstanding this
     Agreement, Employer (or its affiliates), in determining compensation,
     if any, otherwise payable to Executive, may take the Vested Amount
     into account.
          
          SECTION EIGHT. -- ASSIGNABILITY AND BINDING EFFECT.
          --------------------------------------------------
   
          This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding
     upon the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and legal
     representatives of Executive, and shall inure to the benefit of and be
     binding upon Employer and its successors, but the obligations of Executive
     hereunder may not be assigned to another person, firm or corporation nor 
     may they be delegated.

<PAGE>
          
          SECTION NINE. -- COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING.
          ---------------------------------------

          This Agreement constitutes the complete understanding between the
     parties with respect to the compensation arrangement described herein,
     and no statement, representation, warranty or covenant has been made
     by either party with respect thereto except as expressly set forth
     herein.  This Agreement shall not be altered, modified, amended or
     terminated except by written instrument signed by each of the parties
     hereto.

          SECTION TEN. -- SEVERABILITY.
          ----------------------------

          If any provision of this Agreement or any part hereof is invalid,
     unlawful or incapable of being enforced, by reason of any rule of law
     or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
     Agreement which can be given effect without such invalid, unlawful or
     unenforceable provision shall, nevertheless, remain in full force and
     effect.

          SECTION ELEVEN. -- WARRANTY.
          ---------------------------

          Executive warrants and represents that he is not a party to any
     agreement, contract or understanding, whether of employment or
     otherwise, which would in any way restrict or prohibit him from
     undertaking or performing employment in accordance with the terms and
     conditions of this Agreement.
  
          SECTION TWELVE. -- GOVERNING LAW.
          --------------------------------

          This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
     with the laws of the State of New York.

               1.   Employer and Executive hereby consent to the
     appointment of and hereby appoint Weil, Gotshal & Manges as Escrow
     Agent, to serve as escrow agent in accordance with the terms and
     conditions herein set forth, and Escrow Agent hereby accepts such
     appointment.  

               2.   Security Interest.  The parties hereto agree that the
                    -----------------

     Fund Amount is intended to secure any and all liabilities of Employer
     to Executive under the Compensation Agreement.  Employer hereby grants
     to Employee an irrevocable security interest in the Fund Amount and
     the parties hereto agree that the Fund Amount (i) shall be received
     and held by Escrow Agent for the benefit of Employee and to protect
     the interest of Employee in the Fund Amount, and (ii) shall be
     disbursed by Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms hereof.

               3.   The Fund Amount shall be deposited with Escrow Agent as
     follows:

               (a)  On the date hereof, Employer shall deliver to Escrow
     Agent the Fund Amount.  Escrow Agent shall not be liable or
     responsible for the collection of the proceeds of any check payable or
     endorsed to Escrow Agent hereunder.

               (b)  Escrow Agent shall, in accordance with direction
     provided by the Chief Financial Officer of Employer, deposit the Fund
     Amount in certificates of deposit or interest bearing accounts of any
     bank or trust company, incorporated under the laws of the United
     States of America or any state, which has combined capital and surplus
     of not less than $100,000,000.

               (c)  All interest earned on the Fund Amount ("Interest")
     shall be the property of Employer and shall not be added to or become
     part of the Escrow Amount (as defined).  All Interest shall be paid by
     the Escrow Agent, on a current basis, to Employer without the need for
     any further action on the part of Employer.

               (d)  The Fund Amount, as such may from time to time be
     decreased by the release of monies from the Fund Amount pursuant to
     the terms hereof, shall constitute the "Escrow Amount."

               4.  The Escrow Amount shall be released by the Escrow Agent
     as follows:

               (a)  Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of Disbursing
     Instructions in the form attached as Annex A hereto executed by both
     Executive and Employer, Escrow Agent shall release to Executive so
     much of the Escrow Amount as indicated in the Disbursing Instructions;
     and

               (b)  Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of Disbursing
     Instructions in the form attached as Annex B hereto executed by both
     Executive and Employer, Escrow Agent shall release to Employer so much
     of the Escrow Amount as indicated in the Disbursing Instructions.

               5.  Any notice or certificate given to Escrow Agent under
     Section 4 shall be by hand or overnight delivery to the parties at the
     addresses set forth in Section 16 of this Agreement.  In the event of
     any dispute, Escrow Agent shall retain the Escrow Amount until the
     dispute is resolved by the final order or judgment of a court having
     jurisdiction with respect thereto.  Reasonable fees and costs of the
     other party or parties shall be advanced by the party giving notice of
     a dispute, and shall be borne by the party or parties not prevailing
     in the action.

               6.   Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
     be fully protected from all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense
     in acting or omitting to act pursuant to, any instruction, order,
     judgment, certification, affidavit, demand, notice, opinion,
     instrument or other writing delivered to it hereunder without being
     required to determine the authenticity of such document, the
     correctness of any fact stated therein, the propriety of the service
     thereof or the capacity, identity or authority of any party purporting
     to sign or deliver such document.


     
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     

               7.   The duties of Escrow Agent are only as herein
     specifically provided, and are purely ministerial in nature.  Escrow
     Agent shall neither be responsible for, or under, nor chargeable with
     knowledge of, the terms and conditions of any other agreement,
     instrument or document in connection herewith, and shall be required
     to act in respect of the Fund Amount and the Escrow Property only as
     provided in this Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth all the
     obligations of Escrow Agent with respect to any and all matters
     pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder and no additional
     obligations of Escrow Agent shall be implied from the terms of this
     Agreement or any other agreement.  Escrow Agent shall incur no
     liability in connection with the discharge of its obligations under
     this Agreement or otherwise in connection therewith, except such
     liability as may arise from the willful misconduct or gross negligence
     of Escrow Agent.

               8.   Escrow Agent may consult with counsel of its choice,
     which may include attorneys in the firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, and
     shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
     Escrow Agent in accordance with the advice of such counsel.

               9.   Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any modification,
     cancellation or rescission of this Agreement unless in writing and
     signed by Escrow Agent.

               10.  Escrow Agent shall have no tax reporting duties with
     respect to the Fund Amount, the Escrow Amount, the Escrowed Property
     or income thereon, such duties being the responsibility of the party
     or parties which receive, or have the right to receive, any taxable
     income hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Escrow Agent has the
     authority to comply with the provisions of Section 468B(g) of the
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and any regulations promulgated
     thereunder.  Such authority shall include, without limitation, (i) the
     filing of tax returns (including information returns) with respect to
     the Fund Amount, the Escrow Amount, the Escrowed Property or income
     thereon, (ii) the payment of any tax, interest or penalties imposed
     thereon, (iii) the withholding of any amounts which are required to be
     withheld and (iv) the payment over of such withheld amounts to the
     appropriate taxing authority.  The parties to this Agreement, other
     than Escrow Agent, shall provide Escrow Agent with all information
     necessary to enable Escrow Agent to comply with the foregoing.  Escrow
     Agent may withdraw from the Fund Amount or the Escrow Amount amounts
     necessary to pay all applicable income or withholding taxes (plus
     interest and penalties thereon) that are required to be paid.  
     The parties hereto acknowledge that the Fund Amount and the Escrow 
     Amount, excluding any Interest thereon, shall be the Executive's 
     property unless and until disbursed to Employer pursuant to 
     Section 4(b) hereof.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
   

               11.   Escrow Agent is acting as a stakeholder only with
     respect to the Escrowed Property.  If any dispute arises as to whether
     Escrow Agent is obligated to deliver the Escrowed Property or as to
     whom the Escrowed Property is to be delivered or the amount thereof,
     Escrow Agent shall not be required to make any delivery, but in such
     event Escrow Agent may hold the Escrowed Property until receipt by
     Escrow Agent of instructions in writing, signed by all parties which
     have, or claim to have, an interest in the Escrowed Property,
     directing the disposition of the Escrowed Property, or in the absence
     of such authorization, Escrow Agent may hold the Escrowed Property
     until receipt of a certified copy of a final judgment of a court of
     competent jurisdiction providing for the disposition of the Escrowed
     Property.  Escrow Agent may require, as a condition to the disposition
     of the Escrowed Property pursuant to written instructions,
     indemnification and/or opinions of counsel, in form and substance
     satisfactory to Escrow Agent, from each party providing such
     instructions.  If such written instructions, indemnification and
     opinions are not received, or proceedings for such determination are
     not commenced within 30 days after receipt by Escrow Agent of notice
     of any such dispute and diligently continued, or if Escrow Agent is
     uncertain as to which party or parties are entitled to the Escrowed
     Property, Escrow Agent may either (i) hold the Escrowed Property until
     receipt of (A) such written instructions and indemnification or (B) a
     certified copy of a final judgment of a court of competent
     jurisdiction providing for the disposition of the Escrowed Property,
     or (ii) deposit the Escrowed Property in the registry of a court of
     competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
     foregoing, Escrow Agent may, but shall not be required to, institute
     legal proceedings of any kind.

               12.  Employer and Executive, jointly and severally, agree to
     reimburse Escrow Agent on demand for, and to indemnify and hold Escrow
     Agent harmless against and with respect to, any and all loss,
     liability, damage, or expense (including, without limitation, taxes,
     attorneys' fees and costs) that Escrow Agent may suffer or incur in
     connection with the entering into of this Agreement and performance of
     its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise in connection
     therewith, except to the extent such loss, liability, damage or
     expense arises from the willful misconduct of Escrow Agent.  Escrow
     Agent, after not less than ten days prior written notice to the 
     other parties hereto, shall have the right at any time and from 
     time to time to charge, and reimburse itself from, the Escrowed 
     Property for all amounts to which it is entitled pursuant this 
     Agreement.

<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

               13.  Escrow Agent and any successor escrow agent may at any
     time resign as such by delivering the Escrowed Property to either (i)
     any successor escrow agent designated by all the parties hereto (other
     than Escrow Agent) in writing, or (ii) any court having competent
     jurisdiction.  Upon its resignation and delivery of the Escrowed
     Property as set forth in this paragraph, Escrow Agent (or any
     successor escrow agent, as the case may be) shall be discharged of,
     and from, any and all further obligations arising in connection with
     the escrow contemplated by this Agreement.  

               14.  Escrow Agent shall have the right to represent any
     party hereto in any dispute between the parties hereto with respect to
     the Escrowed Property or otherwise.

               15.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be
     binding upon, the parties hereto and their respective permitted
     successors and assigns.  Nothing in this Agreement, express or
     implied, shall give to anyone, other than the parties hereto and their
     respective permitted successors and assigns, any benefit, or any legal
     or equitable right, remedy or claim, under or in respect of this
     Agreement or the escrow contemplated hereby. 

               16.  Except as specifically provided otherwise herein, any
     notice authorized or required to be given to a party hereto pursuant
     to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been duly given when
     delivered by hand or facsimile transmission or when deposited in the
     United States mail, by registered or certified mail, return receipt
