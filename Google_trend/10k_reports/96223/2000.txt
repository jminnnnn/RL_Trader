Item 1.      Business.
- ------       --------
                                   THE COMPANY


        The Company is a diversified financial services holding company
principally engaged in commercial and personal lines of property and casualty
insurance, banking and lending, manufacturing and real estate activities. The
Company concentrates on return on investment and cash flow to build long-term
shareholder value, rather than emphasizing volume or market share. Additionally,
the Company continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing
operations and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to
maximize shareholder value.

        Shareholders' equity has grown from a deficit of $7,657,000 at December
31, 1978 (prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Company by
the Company's Chairman and President), to a positive shareholders' equity of
$1,121,988,000 at December 31, 1999, equal to a book value per common share of
the Company (a "Common Share") of negative $.11 at December 31, 1978 and $19.75
at December 31, 1999. The December 31, 1999 shareholders' equity and book value
per share amounts have been reduced for the cash dividends described below.

        In May and December 1999, the Company paid an aggregate $13.58 per share
cash dividend (the "Dividend"), totaling $811,925,000. Pursuant to a ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service, the Company was able to pay the Dividend and have
any gain realized treated as capital gain income for non-corporate shareholders.
Payment of the Dividend required the Company to make an offer to purchase all of
its 8-1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2005 (the "8-1/4% Notes") and all of
its 7-7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 (the "7-7/8% Notes"), at a
purchase price of 101% of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
Pursuant to such offers, in June 1999, the Company repurchased $194,223,000
aggregate principal amount of the 8-1/4% Notes and 7-7/8% Notes for
$198,000,000, including accrued interest.

        During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company repurchased
5,182,958 Common Shares for an aggregate cost of $125,481,000. From January 1,
2000 through March 13, 2000, the Company repurchased 1,505,000 Common Shares for
an aggregate cost of $32,095,000 ($21.33 per share). As of March 13, 2000, the
Company is authorized to repurchase an additional 4,495,000 Common Shares. Such
purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades
or otherwise. Depending on market conditions and other factors, such purchases
may be commenced or suspended without prior notice.

        During 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
Tranex Credit Corp. ("Tranex"), a subprime automobile lender, for aggregate cash
consideration of $128,000,000. The assets purchased included Tranex's
$67,900,000 subprime automobile portfolio, $44,200,000 of residual interests and
excess servicing assets of related securitized trusts and $16,000,000 of certain
other assets.

        In 1999, the Company increased its interest in MK Gold Company ("MK
Gold") to 72.5% for aggregate cash consideration of $15,800,000. In addition,
the Company lent $20,000,000 to MK Gold, which used the proceeds from the
Company's stock purchase and loan to acquire Cobre Las Cruces, S.A., a Spanish
company that holds the exploration and mining rights to the Las Cruces copper
deposit in the pyrite belt of Spain, for total cash consideration of
$42,000,000. The initial stages of a feasibility study conducted by the former
owner indicate the existence of a resource of 15.2 million metric tonnes grading
6.1% copper that is overlain by a gold-bearing gossan (which has not been
evaluated) and by 150 meters of unconsolidated overburden. Actual mining will be
subject to permitting, after which significant financing would be required to
engineer, construct and develop the mine. MK Gold's interest in Cobre Las
Cruces is subject to a one-year option held by an Australian mining company
to purchase a 35% interest in Cobre Las Cruces at MK Gold's cost, plus interest.

<PAGE>
        During 1999, the Company sold all of its interests in Caja de Ahorro y
Seguro S.A. ("Caja"), its Russian joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc. ("PIB"), The
Sperry and Hutchinson Company, Inc. and Charter National Life Insurance Company
("Charter") and Intramerica Life Insurance Company ("Intramerica") for aggregate
cash and other consideration of $249,700,000, and recorded aggregate pre-tax
gains of $185,200,000.

        In January 2000, the Company sold its 10% equity interest in Jordan
Telecommunication Products, Inc. The Company expects to report a pre-tax gain of
$24,600,000 in first quarter of 2000 results of operations. Further
consideration of approximately $7,500,000 may be received in the future upon the
favorable resolution of certain contingencies.

        The Company's insurance operations consist of commercial and personal
property and casualty insurance primarily conducted through Empire Insurance
Company ("Empire"), Allcity Insurance Company ("Allcity") and Centurion
Insurance Company ("Centurion"). For the year ended December 31, 1999, these
insurance operations accounted for 26% of the Company's revenues and at December
31, 1999, 26% of the Company's assets.

        The Company's insurance operations have a diversified investment
portfolio of securities, of which 75% are issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
Treasury or by U.S. governmental agencies or are rated "investment grade" by
Moody's Investors Service Inc. ("Moody's") and/or Standard & Poor's Corporation
("S&P").

        The Company's banking and lending operations principally consist of
making instalment loans to niche markets primarily funded by customer banking
deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The
Company's principal lending activities consist of providing collateralized
personal automobile loans to individuals with poor credit histories.

        The Company's manufacturing operations manufacture and market plastic
netting used for a variety of purposes including, among other things,
construction, agriculture, packaging, carpet padding and filtration.

        The Company's foreign real estate operations are conducted through
Compagnie Fonciere FIDEI, a French company whose bonds are listed on the Paris
Stock Exchange ("Fidei").

        As used herein, the term "Company" refers to Leucadia National
Corporation, a New York corporation organized in 1968, and its subsidiaries,
except as the context otherwise may require.

                  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

          The Company's reportable segments consist of its operating units,
which offer different products and services and are managed separately. These
reportable segments are: property and casualty insurance, banking and lending,
foreign real estate, manufacturing and other operations. The property and
casualty insurance operations provide commercial and personal lines of insurance
in the New York metropolitan area. The banking and lending operations
principally make collateralized personal automobile instalment loans to
individuals who have difficulty obtaining credit, at interest rates above those
charged to individuals with good credit histories. Such loans are primarily
funded by deposits insured by the FDIC. The foreign real estate consists of the
operations of Fidei in France. The manufacturing operations manufacture and
market proprietary plastic netting used for a variety of purposes. Other
operations primarily consist of domestic real estate activities and winery
operations. Associated companies primarily include equity interests in entities
that the Company does not control and that are accounted for on the equity
method of accounting. The information in the following table for corporate
assets primarily consists of investments, notes receivable from the sale of
certain businesses and cash and cash equivalents. Corporate revenues primarily
consist of investment income on corporate assets. Corporate assets, revenues,
overhead expenses and interest expense are not allocated to the operating units.
Other than the Company's foreign real estate operations, the Company does not
have material foreign operations and investments.

        Certain information concerning the Company's segments for 1999, 1998 and
1997 is presented in the following table. Prior period amounts have been
restated for the foreign real estate operations, which were previously included
in the Other Operations segment.

                         PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE

General

        The Company's principal property and casualty insurance operations are
conducted through the Empire Group, which consists of Empire, Allcity and
Centurion. The Empire Group specializes in commercial and personal property and
casualty insurance business primarily in the New York metropolitan area. The
Empire Group offers insurance products for vehicles (including medallion and
radio-controlled livery vehicles), general liability coverage, property coverage
(including mercantile and multi-family residential real estate) and workers'
compensation to commercial accounts and private passenger automobile and
homeowners products to individuals. The Empire Group is rated "B+" (very good)
by A.M. Best Company ("Best") and rated "BBB+" (good) by S&P. As with all
ratings, Best and S&P ratings are subject to change at any time.

        The business of the Empire Group is organized into three divisions: the
Small Business Division, the Personal Lines Division and the Mid-Market
Division. Each of these divisions has separate management teams responsible for
all marketing, sales and underwriting decisions within their divisions. The
Small Business Division focuses on commercial package products for small
businesses; the Personal Lines Division concentrates on personal automobile and
homeowners insurance; and the Mid-Market Division focuses on commercial auto,
commercial package and workers' compensation insurance for larger accounts. Over
the past two years, the Empire Group has invested resources to enhance and
market its products, to upgrade the quality of customer service and to provide
its agents with the ability to sell products, process applications, receive
price quotes and obtain other policy and claim information via the Internet. The
Empire Group plans to expand its Internet services in the future.

        For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, net earned
premiums for the Empire Group were $145,200,000, $228,600,000 and $275,000,000,
respectively. While net earned premiums declined in all lines of business, the
most significant reductions were in assigned risk automobile and voluntary
private passenger automobile lines. As a result of poor operating results in the
assigned risk business, the Empire Group no longer participates in this line of
business. Effective January 1, 2000, all policy renewal obligations have been
assigned to another insurance company. However, the Empire Group remains liable
for the claim settlement costs for assigned risk claims that occured during the
policy term. The Empire Group believes it has provided adequate reserves for
such liabilities, including loss adjustment expenses. With respect to private
passenger automobile insurance, poor underwriting results have resulted in a
re-underwriting of the existing book of business, the termination of certain
agency relationships and, for certain other agents, a determination not to
accept any applications for new private passenger automobile business.
Additionally, re-underwriting efforts in other commercial lines, along with
terminated and/or reduced agency relationships referred to above, have resulted
in reduced commercial lines premiums.

        The Empire Group's reduced premium volume does not support its current
overhead structure. The Empire Group is currently examining its overhead costs
and plans to implement an expense reduction program this year to more closely
align these costs with its current volume of business. In order to return to
profitability, the Empire Group also will have to generate new business,
primarily in the Small Business Division and in the radio-controlled livery line
of the Mid-Market Division, and improve retention of its existing profitable
business. An important customer service feature, which is designed to enable the
Empire Group to attract profitable business, is the ability to provide producers
faster quoting of policy prices and underwriting approval over the Internet. The
Empire Group is currently providing this service for commercial policies issued
by the Small Business Division, and plans to continue to invest in technology in
order to expand this service to other lines of business in the future.

        During the year ended December 31, 1999, 13% of net earned premiums of
the Empire Group were derived from assigned risk business, 12% from commercial
automobile lines, 35% from other commercial lines and 40% from personal lines.
Substantially all of the Empire Group's policies are written in New York for a
one-year period. The Empire Group is licensed in New York to write most lines of
insurance that may be written by a property and casualty insurer. The Empire
Group is also licensed to write insurance in Connecticut, Massachusetts,
Missouri, New Hampshire and New Jersey.

        The business of the Empire Group is produced through general agents,
local agents and insurance brokers, who are compensated for their services by
payment of commissions on the premiums they generate. There are seven general
agents, one of which is owned by Empire, and 398 local agents and insurance
brokers presently acting under agreements with the Empire Group. These agents
and brokers also represent other competing insurance companies. The Empire
Group's owned general agent is its largest producer and generated 12% of its
total premium volume for the year ended December 31, 1999.

        On a quarterly basis, the Empire Group reviews and adjusts its estimated
loss reserves for any changes in trends and actual loss experience. Included in
the Empire Group's results for 1999 was $17,000,000 for reserve increases
related to losses from prior accident years. The Empire Group will continue to
evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves and record future adjustments to its
loss reserves as appropriate. Over the past few years, the Empire Group has
taken steps to improve its operations, enhance its information systems, redefine
its markets and improve its underwriting and claims handling procedures. The
Company believes that the results of these efforts may not be known for some
time, given the nature of the property and casualty insurance business and the
inherently long period of time involved in settling claims.

        Set forth below is certain statistical information for the Empire Group
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
and statutory accounting principles ("SAP"). The Loss Ratio is the ratio of net
incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to net premiums earned. The Expense
Ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses (policy acquisition costs,
commissions, and a portion of administrative, general and other expenses
attributable to underwriting operations) to net premiums written, if determined
in accordance with SAP, or to net premiums earned, if determined in accordance
with GAAP. A Combined Ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit and a
Combined Ratio above 100% indicates an underwriting loss. The Combined Ratio
does not include the effect of investment income.

      Industry Combined Ratios may not be fully comparable as a result of, among
      other things, differences in geographical concentration and in the mix of
      property and casualty insurance products.

(b)   For 1998, the difference in the accounting treatment for curtailment gains
      relating to defined benefit pension plans was the principal reason for the
      difference between the GAAP Combined Ratio and the SAP Combined Ratio.
      Additionally for all three years, the difference relates to the accounting
      for certain costs which are treated differently under SAP and GAAP. For
      further information about the Empire Group's Combined Ratios, see Item 7,

Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

        Liabilities for unpaid losses, which are not discounted (except for
certain workers' compensation liabilities), and loss adjustment expenses ("LAE")
are determined using case-basis evaluations, statistical analyses and estimates
for salvage and subrogation recoverable and represent estimates of the ultimate
claim costs of all unpaid losses and LAE. Liabilities include a provision for
losses that have occurred but have not yet been reported. These estimates are
subject to the effect of trends in future claim severity and frequency
experience. Adjustments to such estimates are made from time to time due to
changes in such trends as well as changes in actual loss experience. These
adjustments are reflected in current earnings.

        The Empire Group relies upon standard actuarial ultimate loss projection
techniques to obtain estimates of liabilities for losses and LAE. These
projections include the extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred by
business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of inflation
and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon historical
patterns. In addition, methods based upon average loss costs, reported claim
counts and pure premiums are reviewed in order to obtain a range of estimates
for setting the reserve levels. For further input, changes in operations in
pertinent areas including underwriting standards, product mix, claims management
and legal climate are periodically reviewed.

        In the following table, the liability for losses and LAE of the Empire
Group is reconciled for each of the three years ended December 31, 1999.
Included therein are current year data and prior year development.

        The following table presents the development of balance sheet
liabilities from 1989 through 1999 for the Empire Group. The liability line at
the top of the table indicates the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE
recorded as of the dates indicated. The middle section of the table shows the
re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as
of the end of each succeeding year. As more information becomes available and
claims are settled, the estimated liabilities are adjusted upward or downward
with the effect of decreasing or increasing net income at the time of
adjustment. The lower section of the table shows the cumulative amount paid with
respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding
year.

        The "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" represents the aggregate change
in the estimates over all prior years. For example, the initial 1989 liability
estimate indicated on the table of $235,223,000 has been re-estimated during the
course of the succeeding ten years, resulting in a re-estimated liability at
December 31, 1999 of $235,230,000 or a deficiency of $7,000. If the re-estimated
liability were less than the liability initially established, a cumulative
redundancy would be indicated.

        In evaluating this information, it should be noted that each amount
shown for "cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" includes the effects of all
changes in amounts for prior periods. For example, the amount of the redundancy
(deficiency) related to losses settled in 1993, but incurred in 1989, will be
included in the cumulative redundancy (deficiency) amount for 1989, 1990, 1991
and 1992. This table is not intended to and does not present accident or policy
year loss and LAE development data. Conditions and trends that have affected
development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the
future. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to extrapolate future
redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.

experience, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" of this Report.

Investments

        Investment activities represent a significant part of the Company's
insurance related revenues and profitability. Investments are managed by the
Company's investment advisors under the direction of, and upon consultation
with, the Company's investment committees.

        The Company's insurance subsidiaries have a diversified investment
portfolio of securities, a substantial portion of which is rated "investment
grade" by Moody's and/or S&P or issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by
governmental agencies. The Company's insurance subsidiaries do not generally
invest in less than "investment grade" or "non-rated" securities, real estate or
mortgages, although from time to time they may make such investments in amounts
not expected to be material.

        The composition of the Company's insurance subsidiaries' investment
portfolio as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 was as follows:

Reinsurance

        The Empire Group's maximum retained limit for all lines of business was
$300,000 for 1999. The Empire Group's maximum retained limit for 1998 and 1997
was $500,000 for workers' compensation and $300,000 for other property and
casualty lines. Additionally, the Empire Group has entered into certain excess
of loss and catastrophe treaties to protect against certain losses. The Empire
Group's retention of lower level losses in such treaties is $7,500,000 for 2000,
and was $7,500,000 for 1999 and 1998, and $5,000,000 for 1997.

        Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its
primary liability for the full amount of the policy liability, it does make the
assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded.
The Company's reinsurance generally has been placed with certain of the largest
reinsurance companies, including (with their respective Best ratings) General
Reinsurance Corporation



                                       10
<PAGE>
(A++) and Zurich Reinsurance (North America), Inc. (A+). The Company believes
its reinsurers to be financially capable of meeting their respective
obligations. However, to the extent that any reinsuring company is unable to
meet its obligations, the Company's insurance subsidiaries would be liable for
the reinsured risks. The Company has established reserves, which the Company
believes are adequate, for any nonrecoverable reinsurance.

Competition

        The insurance industry is a highly competitive industry, in which many
of the Company's competitors have substantially greater financial resources,
larger sales forces, more widespread agency and broker relationships, and more
diversified lines of insurance coverage. Additionally, certain competitors
market their products with endorsements from affinity groups, while the
Company's products are unendorsed, which may give these other companies a
competitive advantage. Federal administrative, legislative and judicial activity
has resulted in changes to federal banking laws that increase the ability of
national banks to offer insurance products in direct competition with the
Company. The Company is unable to determine what effect, if any, such changes
may have on the Company's operations.

        The Company believes that property and casualty insurers generally
compete on the basis of price, customer service, consumer recognition, product
design, product mix and financial stability. The industry has historically been
cyclical in nature, with periods of less intense price competition generating
significant profits, followed by periods of increased price competition
resulting in reduced profitability or loss. The current cycle of intense price
competition has continued for a longer period than in the past, suggesting that
the significant infusion of capital into the industry in recent years, coupled
with larger investment returns has been, and may continue to be, a depressing
influence on policy rates. In addition, the Company is experiencing increased
competition from low cost insurance providers that write many lines of business
on a direct response basis through direct mail, telemarketing and the Internet.
The profitability of the property and casualty insurance industry is affected by
many factors, including rate competition, severity and frequency of claims
(including catastrophe losses), interest rates, state regulation, court
decisions and judicial climate, all of which are outside the Company's control.

Government Regulation

        Insurance companies are subject to detailed regulation and supervision
in the states in which they transact business. Such regulation pertains to
matters such as approving policy forms and various premium rates, minimum
reserves and loss ratio requirements, the type and amount of investments,
minimum capital and surplus requirements, granting and revoking licenses to
transact business, levels of operations and regulating trade practices.
Insurance companies are required to file detailed annual reports with the
supervisory agencies in each of the states in which they do business, and are
subject to examination by such agencies at any time. Increased regulation of
insurance companies at the state level and new regulation at the federal level
is possible, although the Company cannot predict the nature or extent of any
such regulation or what impact it would have on the Company's operations.

        The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has adopted
model laws incorporating the concept of a "risk based capital" ("RBC")
requirement for insurance companies. Generally, the RBC formula is designed to
measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory capital in relation to the risks
inherent in its business. The RBC formula is used by the states as an early
warning tool to identify weakly capitalized companies for the purpose of
initiating regulatory action. The Company's insurance operations' RBC ratio as
of December 31, 1999 exceeded minimum requirements. The NAIC also has adopted
various ratios for insurance companies which, in addition to the RBC ratio, are
designed to serve as a tool to assist state regulators in discovering potential
weakly capitalized companies or companies


                                       11
<PAGE>
with unusual trends. While the Company's insurance operations had certain "other
than normal" NAIC ratios for the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company
believes that it is unlikely that material adverse regulatory action will be
taken.

        The Company's insurance subsidiaries are members of state insurance
funds which provide certain protection to policyholders of insolvent insurers
doing business in those states. Due to insolvencies of certain insurers, the
Company's insurance subsidiaries have been assessed certain amounts which have
not been material and are likely to be assessed additional amounts by state
insurance funds. The Company believes that it has provided for all anticipated
assessments and that any additional assessments will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.



                               BANKING AND LENDING

        The Company's banking and lending operations principally are conducted
through American Investment Bank, N.A. ("AIB"), a national bank subsidiary, and
American Investment Financial ("AIF"), an industrial loan corporation. AIB and
AIF take money market and other non-demand deposits that are eligible for
insurance provided by the FDIC. AIB and AIF had deposits of $329,301,000 and
$189,782,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. AIB and AIF currently
have several deposit-taking and lending facilities in the Salt Lake City area.
The funds generated by the deposits are primarily used to fund consumer
instalment loans.

        During 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
Tranex. AIB purchased Tranex's subprime automobile portfolio for $67,900,000 and
certain other assets for $4,000,000. Another subsidiary of the Company acquired
$44,200,000 of residual interests and excess servicing assets of related
securitized trusts and $12,000,000 of certain other assets. Since acquisition,
AIB has been integrating Tranex's operations with its own automobile lending
operations, focusing its efforts on establishing uniform underwriting criteria
and procedures and reducing expenses through elimination of overhead
redundancies and closing unprofitable offices. Prior to acquisition, Tranex's
monthly new loan volume was at least equal to the Company's volume. While the
Company's stricter underwriting standards have resulted in a reduction in
Tranex's new loan volume, consolidated new loan volumes have increased
significantly.

        The Company's consolidated banking and lending operations had
outstanding loans (net of unearned finance charges) of $339,773,000 and
$185,183,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. At December 31, 1999,
82% were loans to individuals generally collateralized by automobiles; 12% were
loans to consumers, substantially all of which were collateralized by real or
personal property; 1% were unsecured loans to individuals acquired from others
in connection with investments in limited partnerships; 2% were unsecured loans
to executives and professionals, generally with good credit histories; and 3%
were loans to small businesses.

        It is the Company's policy to charge to income an allowance for losses
which, based upon management's analysis of numerous factors, including current
economic trends, aging of the loan portfolio and historical loss experience, is
deemed adequate to cover reasonably expected losses on outstanding loans. At
December 31, 1999, the allowance for loan losses for the Company's entire loan
portfolio was $16,975,000 or 5.0% of the net outstanding loans, compared to
$9,398,000 or 5.1% of net outstanding loans at December 31, 1998.

        The Company's loss experience has been very favorable in recent years.
While the Company attributes some of this experience to its underwriting
procedures, it also recognizes it has derived substantial benefit from the
strong domestic economy. Should economic conditions change and the economy
weaken, the Company expects its losses would increase and a tightening of
underwriting standards and procedures would be required, resulting in reduced
new loan volume.


                                       12
<PAGE>
        Collateralized personal automobile instalment loans are primarily made
through automobile dealerships to individuals who have difficulty obtaining
credit, at interest rates above those charged to individuals with good credit
histories. The contractual maturity for automobile loans originated in 1999 was
57 months, with an anticipated average life of 22 months. The Company currently
generates automobile loans in 29 states through non-exclusive relationships with
dealers, with no individual state or dealership representing a significant
portion of the Company's loan volume. In determining which individuals qualify
for these loans, the Company takes into account a number of highly selective
criteria with respect to the individual as well as the collateral to attempt to
minimize the number of defaults. Additionally, the Company closely monitors
these loans and takes prompt possession of the collateral in the event of a
default. For the three year period ended December 31, 1999, the Company
generated $252,013,000 of these loans ($144,611,000 during 1999). Such amounts
exclude the Tranex acquisition and the Company's purchase of a $36,900,000
portfolio of such loans in 1998. The Company intends to continue to acquire
additional portfolios of such loans that meet the Company's underwriting
standards if they can be purchased on attractive terms.

        The Company's banking and lending operations compete with banks, savings
and loan associations, credit unions, credit card issuers and consumer finance
companies, many of which are able to offer financial services on very
competitive terms. Additionally, substantial national financial services
networks have been formed by major brokerage firms, insurance companies,
retailers and bank holding companies. Some competitors have substantial local
market positions; others are part of large, diversified organizations.

        The Company's principal banking and lending operations are subject to
detailed supervision by state authorities, as well as federal regulation
pursuant to the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Truth in Lending
Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the
Community Reinvestment Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and regulations
promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission. The Company's banking operations
are subject to federal and state regulation and supervision by, among others,
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), the FDIC and the
State of Utah. AIB's primary federal regulator is the OCC, while the primary
federal regulator for AIF is the FDIC.

        The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 ("CEBA") places certain
restrictions on the operations of AIB and restricts further acquisitions of
banks and savings institutions by the Company. CEBA does not restrict AIF as
currently operated.

                               FOREIGN REAL ESTATE

        Through its French subsidiary, Fidei, the Company owns foreign real
estate properties with a book value of $87,566,000 at December 31, 1999. After
considering Fidei's other assets and non-recourse liabilities, the Company's net
investment in this segment was $38,129,000 at December 31, 1999. During 1999,
Fidei sold 62 properties resulting in pre-tax gains of $37,900,000; at December
31, 1999, a total of 88 properties aggregating approximately 2,100,000 square
feet remain. For 1999, Fidei generated $31,800,000 of pre-tax income. Since
acquisition, Fidei has been marketing all of its real estate holdings for sale,
which is anticipated to be substantially completed by the end of 2001. Given
Fidei's attractive financing and tax loss carryforwards, the Company is seeking
new investemnts for it.

                                  MANUFACTURING

        Through its plastics division, the Company manufactures and markets
proprietary plastic netting used for a variety of purposes including, among
other things, construction, agriculture, packaging, carpet padding and
filtration. The plastics division markets its products both domestically and
internationally, with approximately 13% of its 1999 sales exported to Europe,
Latin America, Japan and Australia. New product development focuses on niches
where the division's proprietary technology and expertise can lead to
sustainable competitive economic advantages. For the years ended December 31,
1999, 1998 and 1997, the plastics division's revenues were $64,000,000,
$56,600,000 and $50,900,000, respectively.


                                       13

        In order to meet existing and expected product demand in the future, the
plastics division is increasing its manufacturing capacity and opening a
manufacturing facility in Europe. The European facility is expected to service
customers in the European and Asian markets, which are currently being serviced
by the Company's domestic manufacturing facilities. The Company expects that the
European facility and equipment will require a capital investment of
approximately $19,500,000, some or all of which may be financed. The facility is
expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2001 and should increase
capacity by approximately 20% when fully operational.

        The plastics division is subject to domestic and international
competition, generally on the basis of price, service and quality. Additionally,
certain products are dependent on cyclical industries, including the
construction industry. The Company holds patents on certain improvements to the
basic manufacturing processes and on applications thereof. The Company believes
that the expiration of these patents, individually or in the aggregate, is
unlikely to have a material effect on the plastics division.


                                OTHER OPERATIONS

        The Company has a 90% interest in two wineries, Pine Ridge Winery in
Napa Valley, California and Archery Summit in the Willamette Valley of Oregon.
Pine Ridge, which was acquired in 1991, has been conducting operations since
1981, while Archery Summit was started by the Company in 1993. These wineries
produce and sell super-ultra-premium wines. During 1999, the wineries sold
76,300 9-liter equivalent cases of wine generating revenues of $13,347,000.
Since acquisition, the Company's investment in winery operations has grown,
principally to fund the Company's acquisition of land for vineyard development
and to increase production capacity and storage facilities at both of the
wineries. It can take up to five years for a new vineyard property to reach full
production and, depending upon the varietal produced, up to an additional two
years before the wine can be sold. The Company expects all of its vineyards will
be in substantially full production for the 2001 harvest, and with normal
farming yields should result in total production of approximately 100,000
9-liter equivalent cases of wine. At December 31, 1999, the Company's combined
investment in these wineries was $51,900,000.

        At December 31, 1999, the Company's domestic real estate investments had
a book value of $196,500,000. Such real estate consists of office buildings,
residential land development projects and other unimproved land, all in various
stages of development and available for sale. The Company's largest domestic
real estate investment is an office complex located on Capitol Hill in
Washington, D.C., with a book value of $76,500,000. This complex, which consists
of two office buildings totaling 630,000 square feet, is fully occupied by the
D.C. Government. The Company expects to obtain financing for this complex in
2000, which is intended to repay its investment. Also included in the Company's
domestic real estate is a project located in San Diego County, California, that
will be a master-planned community of approximately 3,400 homes and apartments
as well as commercial properties expected to be completed over the next ten
years. The Company expects to earn a preferred return of 15% on its investment
in this project (approximately $71,400,000 through December 31, 1999); any
amounts generated above this preferred return will primarily benefit the
development manager, HomeFed Corporation ("HomeFed"), the shares of which were
distributed to the Company's shareholders as described in Item 5 of this Report.
The Company manages each of its real estate projects separately to maximize
returns on investment.

        The Company has a 72.5% interest in MK Gold, a company that is traded on
the NASD OTC Bulletin Board. During 1999, MK Gold acquired Cobre Las Cruces,
S.A., a Spanish company that holds the exploration and mining rights to the Las
Cruces copper deposit in the pyrite belt of Spain. The initial stages of a
feasibility study conducted by the former owner indicate the existence of a
resource of 15.2 million metric tonnes grading 6.1% copper that is overlain by a
gold-bearing gossan (which has not been evaluated) and by 150 meters of
unconsolidated overburden. This resource calculation was based upon the analysis
of 279 drill holes totaling over 272,000 feet. The aforementioned feasibility
study, prepared in 1998, estimated the capital cost would be approximately
$300,000,000 to bring the mine into production. A bankable feasibility study is
currently underway. This study will better define the future capital and
operating costs of the Las Cruces Project. Actual mining will be subject to
permitting (currently underway), significant financing, engineering and
construction. MK Gold's interest in Cobre Las Cruces is subject to a one-year
option held by an Australian mining company to purchase 35% of the company at MK
Gold's cost, plus interest.


                                OTHER INVESTMENTS

        The Company owns equity interests representing more than 5% of the
outstanding capital stock of each of the following domestic public companies at
March 13, 2000: Carmike Cinemas, Inc. ("Carmike") (approximately 6% of Class A
shares), GFSI Holdings, Inc. ("GFSI") (approximately 6%), Jordan Industries,
Inc. ("JII") (approximately 10%) and PhoneTel Technologies, Inc. (approximately
7%).

        A subsidiary of the Company is an owner in The Jordan Company LLC and
Jordan/Zalaznick Capital Company. These entities each specialize in structuring
leveraged buyouts in which the owners are given the opportunity to become equity
participants. Since 1982, the Company has invested an aggregate of $80,400,000
in these entities and related companies and, through December 31, 1999, has
received $118,000,000 relating to the disposition of investments and management
and other fees. At December 31, 1999, through these entities, the Company had
interests in JII, Carmike, GFSI, JZ Equity Partners PLC (a British company
traded on the London Stock Exchange in which the Company holds an approximately
6% equity interest) and a total of 31 other companies, which in total are
carried in the Company's consolidated financial statements at $39,800,000. In
January 2000, the Company sold its 10% equity interest in one of these entities,
Jordan Telecommunication Products, Inc., for $27,000,000.

Item 2.    Properties.
- ------     ----------

        Through its various subsidiaries, the Company owns and utilizes in its
operations offices in Salt Lake City, Utah used for corporate and banking and
lending activities (totaling approximately 77,000 sq. ft.). Subsidiaries of the
Company own a facility (totaling approximately 158,500 sq. ft.) primarily used
for manufacturing located in Georgia and facilities and land in California and
Oregon (totaling approximately 98,000 square feet and 390 acres, respectively)
used for winemaking operations.

        The Company and its subsidiaries lease numerous manufacturing,
warehousing, office and headquarters facilities. The facilities vary in size and
have leases expiring at various times, subject, in certain instances, to renewal
options. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.
- ------     -----------------

        On May 13, 1997, a purported derivative complaint was filed in New York
State Supreme Court against the Company's current Board of Directors and two
former directors. The action, entitled Pinnacle Consultants, Ltd. v. Leucadia


                                       15
<PAGE>
National Corp., et al. (no. 602470/97), alleged violations of New York Business
Corporation Law and claims for fraud, waste, breach of fiduciary duty and
conversion. In February 2000, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the
Appellate Division's prior order dismissing the complaint in its entirety.

        In addition to the foregoing, the Company and its subsidiaries are
parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary, routine
litigation incidental to their business or not material to the Company's
consolidated financial position.

        The Company does not believe that any of the foregoing actions will have
a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or consolidated
results of operations.

(b)   The Combined Ratio does not reflect the effect of investment income. For
      1998, the difference in the accounting treatment for curtailment gains
      relating to the defined benefit pension plans was the principal reason for
      the difference between the GAAP Combined Ratio and the SAP Combined Ratio.
      For 1996 and 1995, a change in the statutory accounting treatment for
      retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements was the principal reason for
      the difference between the GAAP Combined Ratios and the SAP Combined
      Ratios. Additionally in 1999, 1998, 1997 and 1996, the difference relates
      to the accounting for certain costs which are treated differently under
      SAP and GAAP.

(c)   Source: Best's Aggregates & Averages, Property/Casualty, 1999 Edition.
      Industry Combined Ratios may not be fully comparable as a result of, among
      other things, differences in geographical concentration and in the mix of
      property and casualty insurance products.

(d)   Premium to Surplus Ratio was calculated by dividing statutory property and
      casualty insurance premiums written by statutory capital at the end of the
      year.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
- ------   Results of Operations.
         ---------------------------------------------------------------

        The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the Company's
consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of
operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Report.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Parent Company Liquidity

        Leucadia National Corporation (the "Parent") is a holding company whose
assets principally consist of the stock of its several direct subsidiaries, cash
and other liquid investments. The Parent continuously evaluates the retention
and disposition of its existing operations and investigates possible
acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value.
Accordingly, while the Parent does not have any material arrangement, commitment
or understanding with respect thereto (except as disclosed in this Report),
further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure
are possible. Its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources,
bank borrowings, public financings, repayment of subsidiary advances, funds
distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, management and other
fees, and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non-regulated
subsidiaries. It has no substantial recurring cash requirements other than
payment of interest and principal on its debt, tax payments and corporate
overhead expenses. As of December 31, 1999, the Company's readily available
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding those amounts held
by its regulated subsidiaries, totaled $390,900,000. Additional sources of
liquidity as of December 31, 1999 include $110,600,000 of marketable securities
collateralizing letters of credit and $125,600,000 of cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities held by Fidei. In addition, the book value of the
principal amount of promissory notes received from Conseco, Inc. upon the 1997
sale of the Colonial Penn Life Group was $250,000,000 at December 31, 1999.

        During 1999, the Company paid the Dividend of $13.58 per Common Share
totaling $811,925,000. Pursuant to a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service,
any gain realized on the Dividend will be treated as capital gain income for
non-corporate shareholders.

        Payment of the Dividend required the Company to make an offer to
purchase all of its 8-1/4% Notes and its 7-7/8% Notes at a purchase price of
101% of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Pursuant to such
offers, in 1999, the Company repurchased $80,899,000 principal amount of the
8-1/4% Notes and $113,324,000 principal amount of the 7-7/8% Notes for
$198,000,000, including accrued interest. Funds received from repayment of
$150,000,000 of the Conseco Notes were used for a portion of this repurchase.

        Except for the Euro denominated debt of Fidei, which is non-recourse to
the Company, the Parent maintains the principal borrowings for the Company and
its non-banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to certain of its
subsidiaries. These borrowings have primarily been made from banks through
various credit agreement facilities and through public financings.

        During 1999, the Company repurchased 5,182,958 Common Shares for an
aggregate cost of $125,481,000. From January 1, 2000 through March 13, 2000, the
Company repurchased 1,505,000 Common Shares for an aggregate cost of
$32,095,000. As of March 13, 2000, the Company is authorized to repurchase an
additional 4,495,000 Common Shares. Such purchases may be made from time to time


                                       21
<PAGE>
in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. Depending on market
conditions and other factors, such purchases may be commenced or suspended at
any time without prior notice.

        In February 1999, PepsiCo, Inc. exercised its option to purchase the
Company's equity interest in PIB, its joint venture with PepsiCo, for
$39,190,000, including interest. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of
$29,545,000 in connection with the purchase.

        In March 1999, the Company sold all of its interest in Caja to
Assicurazioni Generali Group, an Italian insurance company, for $126,000,000 in
cash and a $40,000,000 collateralized note maturing April 2001 from its
Argentine partner. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $120,800,000 on this
sale.

        In July 1999, the Company sold its discontinued life insurance
subsidiaries, Charter and Intramerica, to Allstate Life Insurance Company for
statutory surplus, as adjusted, at the date of sale ($39,560,000), plus
$3,575,000. Income in 1999 from these operations, net of taxes, was $24,201,000,
of which $15,582,000 resulted from the sale, including the recognition of
deferred gains from prior reinsurance transactions.

        In September 1999, the Company lent to MK Gold $35,800,000 and entered
into a purchase agreement to increase its equity interest to 72.5%. In October
1999, the stock purchase was consummated for approximately $15,800,000 and the
loan was reduced by such amount. During 1999, MK Gold acquired Cobre Las Cruces,
S.A., a Spanish company that holds the exploration and mining rights to the Las
Cruces copper deposit in Spain for total cash consideration of $42,000,000.

        The Company has replaced its two corporate owned aircraft it has used
for ten years with two newer models of used aircraft. During 1999, the Company
paid $43,900,000 of generally available corporate funds to acquire these
aircraft, net of $8,500,000 received upon the sale of one of its older aircraft.
The Company expects to receive approximately $8,000,000 for its remaining
aircraft.

        At December 31, 1999, a maximum of $31,900,000 was available to the
Parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiaries without regulatory approval.
Additional amounts may be available to the Parent in the form of loans or cash
advances from regulated subsidiaries, although no amounts were outstanding at
December 31, 1999 or borrowed to date in 2000. There are no restrictions on
distributions from non-regulated subsidiaries. The Parent also receives tax
sharing payments from subsidiaries included in its consolidated income tax
return, including certain regulated subsidiaries. Because of the tax loss
carryforwards available to the Parent and certain subsidiaries, together with
current interest deductions and corporate expenses, the amount paid by the
Parent for income taxes has been substantially less than tax sharing payments
received from its subsidiaries. Payments from regulated subsidiaries for
dividends, tax sharing payments and other services totaled $17,100,000 for the
year ended December 31, 1999.

        Based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers, the Company
believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable
conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment
opportunities. Since 1993, the Company's senior debt obligations have been rated
as investment grade by S&P and Duff & Phelps Inc. Ratings issued by bond rating
agencies are subject to change at any time.

Consolidated Liquidity

        In 1999, net cash was provided by operations. In 1998, net cash was used
for operations, principally to purchase investments classified as trading and
for the payment of income taxes, partially offset by the repayment of the
Company's bridge financing to PIB.

        The investment portfolio of the Company's insurance subsidiaries
principally consists of fixed maturity investments; the balance of their
portfolio consists largely of preferred securities. Of the fixed maturity


                                       22
<PAGE>
securities, the majority consists of those rated "investment grade" or U.S.
governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although limited
investments in "non-rated" or rated less than investment grade securities have
been made from time to time.

        During 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
Tranex, a subprime automobile lender, for $128,000,000. The Company's banking
and lending subsidiary purchased Tranex's subprime automobile portfolio for
$67,900,000 and certain other assets for $4,000,000. Another subsidiary of the
Company acquired $44,200,000 of residual interests and excess servicing assets
of related securitized trusts and $12,000,000 of certain other assets.

        The Company provides collateralized automobile loans to individuals with
poor credit histories. The Company's investment in automobile loans was
$277,100,000 and $140,400,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Investments in auto loans increased in 1999 due to the purchase of Tranex's
subprime automobile portfolio and due to increased new loan originations. The
Company has expanded into new locations and is offering new programs. The
Company believes its new loan volume has benefited from a decline in competition
due to the failure of certain competitors and a reduction in capital available
for securitizations.

        As of December 31, 1999, the principal amount of Fidei's Euro
denominated outstanding debt, all of which is non-recourse to the Company, was
$214,600,000 (213,200,000 Euros). Inasmuch as Fidei's Euro denominated assets
will be sold over time and such assets are presently funded with Fidei's Euro
denominated debt, the Company has determined not to acquire a currency hedge for
Fidei's Euro denominated debt. During 1999, Fidei paid the Company $41,400,000,
thereby reducing the Company's net investment in Fidei to $38,129,000 at
December 31, 1999.

        In January 2000, the Company committed to invest up to $100,000,000 in
the equity of a limited liability company ("LLC"). The LLC is managed and
controlled by a third party investment manager and will invest in high yield
securities. The Company may redeem its interest in the LLC annually beginning on
Decmeber 31, 2001, or otherwise in certain specified circumstances. The Company
will account for this investment on the equity method.

        The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have loss carryforwards and
other tax attributes. The amount and availability of tax loss carryforwards are
subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to
reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose
limitations on the use of these carryforwards, the Company's certificate of
incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a
person or entity from accumulating at least five percent of the Common Shares
and the ability of persons or entities now owning at least five percent of the
Common Shares from acquiring additional Common Shares.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Property and Casualty Insurance

        The Company's most significant operation is its insurance business,
where it is a provider of property and casualty insurance primarily in the New
York metropolitan area. For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company's
insurance segment contributed 26% of total revenues from continuing operations
and, at December 31, 1999, constituted 26% of total assets.

        Net earned premium revenues of the Empire Group were $145,200,000,
$228,600,000 and $275,000,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively. While earned premiums declined in all lines of business, the
most significant reductions during 1999 were in assigned risk automobile


                                       23
<PAGE>
($24,100,000), voluntary private passenger automobile ($26,900,000) and
commercial package policies ($11,600,000). As a result of poor operating
results, the Empire Group is no longer entering into new assigned risk
contracts. Effective January 1, 2000, all policy renewal obligations have been
assigned to another insurance company. However, the Empire Group remains liable
for the claim settlement costs for assigned risk claims that occurred during the
policy term. The Empire Group believes it has provided adequate reserves for
such liabilities, including loss adjustment expenses. The decline in voluntary
private passenger automobile resulted from tighter underwriting standards,
increased competition and the Empire Group's decision to no longer accept new
policies from those agents who historically have had poor underwriting results.
The Empire Group's termination of certain unprofitable agents has also adversely
affected premium volume in other lines of business.

        In 1998, the decrease in earned premium revenues was primarily due to a
decline in the number of assigned risk automobile pool contracts acquired due to
competition and the depopulation of the assigned risk automobile pools
($24,600,000) and a reduction in certain lines, principally voluntary commercial
automobile ($8,500,000), private passenger automobile ($6,000,000), commercial
package policies ($4,300,000) and workers' compensation ($3,700,000), due to
tighter underwriting standards, reunderwriting and increased competition.

        The Empire Group's combined ratios as determined under GAAP and SAP were
as follows:

        The Empire Group's combined ratios increased in 1999 and 1998 primarily
due to the reduction in premium volume at a rate greater than the reduction in
net underwriting and other costs. In addition, the reduction in servicing fees
negatively affected the expense ratios. Expense ratios were also adversely
affected by increased expenditures related to the installation of new
information systems, providing Internet access to agents and severance costs.
Included in the Empire Group's results for 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $17,000,000,
$42,000,000 and $27,000,000, respectively, for reserve strengthening related to
losses from prior accident years.

        During 1999, the Empire Group experienced unfavorable development due to
an increase in severity of 1998 accident year losses in the assigned risk
automobile and voluntary private passenger automobile lines, and 1996 accident
year losses in certain classes of the commercial automobile line. As a result,
the Empire Group increased its reserves by $7,500,000 for assigned risk
automobile, $5,000,000 for voluntary private passenger automobile and $4,500,000
for commercial automobile lines. As previously discussed, the Empire Group no
longer accepts new policies from certain agents identified as having had poor
underwriting results in the voluntary private passenger automobile line of
business and, effective January 1, 2000, the Empire Group no longer participates
in the assigned risk business. Additionally, the Empire Group no longer offers
insurance in those classes of the commercial automobile line that contributed to
the unfavorable development.

        During 1998, the Empire Group reviewed the adequacy of the reserves
carried for its open claims' files, focusing on workers' compensation,
commercial auto and other commercial liability lines of business. As part of the
review, substantially all open workers' compensation claim files were reviewed
for every accident year up to and including 1998. Additionally, during 1998, the
Empire Group reorganized the commercial auto claims department. As part of this
realignment, more complex claims files were reviewed by the most experienced
claims examiners and assumptions regarding average claims severity and probable
ultimate losses were revised. Accordingly, reserves were strengthened by


                                       24
<PAGE>
$13,000,000 for workers' compensation, $14,000,000 for commercial automobile and
$14,000,000 for other commercial liability lines of business.

        The 1997 reserve strengthening included $11,000,000 for commercial
package lines of business and $7,000,000 for voluntary commercial automobile
lines of business. These increases resulted from a review of open claim files
and the continued unfavorable development of prior accident years losses,
particularly the 1992 through 1994 accident years.

        As a consequence of its reserve increases, the Empire Group has reduced
premiums and pre-tax profits to recognize reinsurance premiums due for 1995 and
prior years under retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements. Such amounts
totaled $4,569,000, $1,976,000, and $5,479,000 for the years ended December 31,
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Empire Group has not entered into
retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements after 1995.

        For the lines of business discussed above, as well as all other property
and casualty lines of business, the Company employs a variety of standard
actuarial ultimate loss projection techniques, statistical analyses and
case-basis evaluations to estimate its liability for unpaid losses. The
actuarial projections include an extrapolation of both losses paid and incurred
by business line and accident year and implicitly consider the impact of
inflation and claims settlement patterns upon ultimate claim costs based upon
historical patterns. These estimates are performed quarterly and consider any
changes in trends and actual loss experience. Any resulting change in the
estimate of the liability for unpaid losses, including those discussed above, is
reflected in current year earnings during the quarter the change in estimate is
identified.

        The reserving process relies on the basic assumption that past
experience is an appropriate basis for predicting future events. The probable
effects of current developments, trends and other relevant matters are also
considered. Since the establishment of loss reserves is affected by many
factors, some of which are outside the Company's control or are affected by
future conditions, reserving for property and casualty claims is a complex and
uncertain process requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments. As
additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, the
Company's estimates and judgments may be revised. While the effect of any such
changes in estimates could be material to future results of operations, the
Company does not expect such changes to have a material effect on its liquidity
or financial condition.

        In management's judgment, information currently available has been
appropriately considered in estimating the Company's loss reserves. The Company
will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves on a quarterly
basis, incorporating any future changes in trends and actual loss experience,
and record adjustments to its loss reserves as appropriate.

Banking and Lending

        Finance revenues and operating profits reflect the level and mix of
consumer instalment loans. For 1999, although finance revenues increased due to
greater average loans outstanding, operating profit declined primarily due to an
increase in the provision for loan losses for the larger volume of loans
outstanding. In addition, 1998 results reflected the pre-tax gain of $6,500,000
from the sale of substantially all of the Company's executive and professional
loan portfolio, as well as a decline in automobile loan losses. Average loans
outstanding for 1999 were $238,600,000 as compared to $148,700,000 for 1998.
This increase was primarily due to the purchase of a subprime automobile
portfolio in December 1998, the Tranex acquisition in 1999 and increased new
loan originations.

Manufacturing

        Since December 1997, the Company's manufacturing operations have
consisted of its plastics division. In 1999, revenues of the plastics division
reached a record level of $64,000,000, an increase of 13% over 1998. In
addition, despite rising raw material prices, the gross profit increased 16% to
$24,900,000. In 1998, the gross profit for the plastics division increased by
14% to $21,400,000. This increase was primarily due to greater sales in most of
the division's product lines and lower raw material costs. The decline in
manufacturing revenues in 1998 compared to 1997 was due to the sale of certain
divisions and the discontinuance of certain non-performing product lines in 1997
and prior years.

Other

        Investment and other income in 1999 included the gains on sale of Caja
($120,800,000), The Sperry and Hutchinson Company, Inc. ($18,700,000) and PIB
($29,545,000), and the gain on sale of an equity interest in an associated
company ($8,700,000). Investment and other income also increased in 1999 due to
increased rent income and gains from sales of real estate properties, of which
$49,800,000 related to Fidei. During 1999, Fidei sold 62 real estate properties;
88 properties remain at December 31, 1999, all of which are currently being
marketed for sale. Such increases were partially offset by a reduction in
investment income resulting primarily from payment of the Dividend and debt
repurchases described above, a reduction in investments held by the Empire Group
and the gain in 1998 on the sale of the executive and professional loan
portfolio. In 1998, investment and other income increased by $16,300,000
primarily due to increased interest income ($63,700,000), the sale of the
Company's executive and professional loan portfolio referred to above,
($6,500,000) and increased income from real estate activities ($8,800,000),
partially offset by reduced gains from sales of real estate and other assets
($40,700,000) and reduced income relating to the service business ($19,100,000).

        During 1998, due to declines in values that were deemed other than
temporary, the Company recorded a pre-tax writedown of $75,000,000 related to
its investments in Russian and Polish debt and equity securities. Such
writedowns are reflected in the caption "Net securities gains (losses)." At
December 31, 1999, the remaining book value of the Company's investments in
these securities was $10,000,000.

        Equity in income (losses) of associated companies declined in 1999 and
improved in 1998, primarily due to income of $30,800,000 from an investment
partnership that was liquidated in 1999. In addition, in 1998, equity in income
(losses) of associated companies improved as compared to 1997 due to a reduction
of $48,400,000 in the Company's equity losses related to PIB.

        Interest expense primarily reflects the level of external borrowings
outstanding throughout the periods, which increased primarily due to Fidei's
outstanding debt, partially offset by the Company's debt repurchases described
above.

        The increase in selling, general and other expenses in 1999 principally
relates to expenses incurred by Fidei, higher provisions for loan losses,
expenses incurred in connection with the Dividend and the recognition in 1998 of
net curtailment gains. The decrease in selling, general and other expenses in
1998 as compared to 1997 principally reflects decreased expenses of the
manufacturing segment principally as a result of the sale of certain divisions
in 1997, decreased pension expense due to the recognition of net curtailment
gains of $6,500,000 in 1998, a 1997 charge for estimated costs to settle
litigation relating to a lending program that has been liquidated and lower
provisions for loan losses.

        Income taxes for 1999 reflect a benefit of $40,100,000 from the
utilization of capital loss carryforwards, of which $33,300,000 was previously
included in the valuation allowance. Income taxes for 1999 also reflect a
benefit of $3,400,000 for the favorable resolution of certain federal income tax


                                       26
<PAGE>
contingencies. Income taxes for 1998 reflect a benefit of $39,000,000 for a
change in the Company's estimated 1997 federal tax liability and the favorable
resolution of certain contingencies. The 1997 income tax benefit was greater
than the expected normal corporate tax rate primarily due to the favorable
resolution of certain contingencies.

        The number of shares used to calculate basic earnings (loss) per share
was 59,338,000, 63,409,000 and 62,205,000 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings (loss) per share was
59,352,000, 63,510,000 and 62,205,000 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
- -------   ----------------------------------------------------------

        The following includes "forward-looking statements" that involve risk
and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected
in the forward-looking statements.

        The Company's market risk arises principally from interest rate risk
related to its investment portfolio, its borrowing activities and the banking
and lending activities of certain subsidiaries. The Company does not enter into
material derivative financial instrument transactions.

        The Company's investment portfolio is primarily classified as available
for sale, and consequently, is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders' equity. Included in the
Company's investment portfolio are fixed income securities, which comprised
approximately 77% of the Company's total investment portfolio at December 31,
1999. These fixed income securities are primarily rated "investment grade" or
are U.S. governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations, although limited
investments in "non-rated" or rated less than investment grade securities have
been made from time to time. The estimated weighted average remaining life of
these fixed income securities was approximately 3.5 years at December 31, 1999.
The Company's fixed income securities, like all fixed income instruments, are


                                       27
<PAGE>
subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates
increase. At December 31, 1998, fixed income securities comprised approximately
90% of the Company's total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted
average remaining life of 2.5 years. During 1999, the Company's fixed income
investments declined at the Empire Group and to fund the Dividend. At December
31, 1999 and 1998, the Company's portfolio of trading securities was not
material. The Company manages the investment portfolio of its insurance
subsidiaries to preserve principal, maintain a high level of quality, comply
with applicable insurance industry regulations and achieve an acceptable rate of
return. In addition, the Company considers the duration of its insurance
reserves in comparison with that of its investments.

        The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term fixed
interest rate debt and the Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of its subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities
of the Company. Generally, the fair market value of debt and preferred
securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall, and
the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise.

        The Company's banking and lending operations are subject to risk
resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a
difference between the amount of the interest-earning assets and the amount of
interest-bearing liabilities that are prepaid/withdrawn, mature or reprice in
specified periods. The principal objectives of the Company's banking and lending
asset/liability management activities are to provide maximum levels of net
interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and
liquidity risk and to facilitate funding needs. The Company utilizes an interest
rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount
of interest rate risk that is present. The model quantifies the effects of
various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest margin over the
ensuing twelve-month period. Derivative financial instruments, including
interest rate swaps, may be used to modify the Company's indicated net interest
sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on risk management policies
and the Company's current economic outlook. Counterparties to such agreements
are major financial institutions, which the Company believes are able to fulfill
their obligations; however, if they are not, the Company believes that any
losses are unlikely to be material.

        The following table provides information about the Company's financial
instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes
in interest rates. For investment securities and debt obligations, the table
presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates. For the variable rate
notes receivable and variable rate borrowings, the weighted average interest
rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting
date. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the
table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the Company's
historical experience of loan prepayments and prepayments of mortgage-backed
securities. For banking and lending's variable rate products, the weighted
average variable rates are based upon the respective pricing index at the
reporting date. For money market deposits that have no contractual maturity, the
table presents principal cash flows based on the Company's historical experience
and management's judgment concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors. For
interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts by contractual maturity
date.

Financial Statements.

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Leucadia National Corporation


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under item 14(a) (1) (2) of this Form 10-K, present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Leucadia National Corporation and
Subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
listed in the index appearing under item 14(a) (1) (2) of this Form 10-K,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatements. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above.

LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Nature of Operations:
    --------------------

The Company is a diversified financial services holding company engaged in
commercial and personal lines of property and casualty insurance, principally in
the New York metropolitan area, banking and lending and manufacturing,
principally in markets in the United States, and real estate activities. The
Company's principal commercial lines of insurance are property and casualty
products provided for vehicles (including medallion and radio-controlled livery
vehicles), multi-family residential real estate, workers' compensation and
various other business classes. The Company's principal personal lines insurance
products are automobile insurance and homeowners insurance.

The Company's banking and lending operations principally consist of making
instalment loans to niche markets primarily funded by deposits insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company's manufacturing operations
manufacture and market proprietary plastic netting used for a variety of
purposes.

In 1998, the Company classified as discontinued operations its life insurance
subsidiaries, Charter National Life Insurance Company ("Charter") and
Intramerica Life Insurance Company ("Intramerica").

2.  Significant Accounting Policies:
    -------------------------------

(a) Use of Estimates in Preparing Financial Statements: The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

(b) Consolidation Policy: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all controlled entities.  All significant
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

Investments in entities which the Company does not control but has the ability
to exercise significant influence are accounted for on the equity method of
accounting.

Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to be consistent with
the 1999 presentation.

(c) Statements of Cash Flows: The Company considers short-term investments,
which have maturities of less than three months at the time of acquisition, to
be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments of
$202,603,000 and $323,305,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

(d) Investments: At acquisition, marketable debt and equity securities are
designated as either i) held to maturity, which are carried at amortized cost,
ii) trading, which are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and
losses reflected in results of operations, or iii) available for sale, which are
carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a
separate component of shareholders' equity, net of taxes. Held to maturity
investments are made with the intention of holding such securities to maturity,
which the Company has the ability to do. Estimated fair values are principally
based on quoted market prices.


                                       F-7

2.  Significant Accounting Policies, continued:
    -------------------------------

Investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary
are written down to estimated net realizable values. The writedowns are included
in "Net securities gains (losses)" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
cost of securities sold is based on average cost.

The Company's investments in Russian and Polish equity securities ($9,981,000
and $18,992,000 as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively), none of which
is held by the insurance or banking subsidiaries, do not have readily
determinable fair values. Given the uncertainties inherent in investing in the
emerging markets of Russia and Poland, the Company is accounting for these
investments under the cost recovery method, whereby all receipts are applied to
reduce the investment. Quarterly, the Company reviews its investment in Russian
and Polish equity securities to determine that the carrying amount is
realizable. In performing such reviews, the Company considers current market
prices, prior sale transactions, the current political and economic environment
and other factors. These investments are included in "Other investments" in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 1999 and 1998, due to declines in values
that were deemed other than temporary, the Company recorded a pre-tax writedown
of $2,650,000 and $75,000,000, respectively, related to its investments in
Russian and Polish debt and equity securities. Such writedowns are reflected in
the caption "Net securities gains (losses)."

(e) Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements: Property, equipment and
leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and
amortization ($94,513,000 and $76,397,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively). Depreciation and amortization are provided principally on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, if less,
the term of the underlying lease.

(f) Income Recognition from Insurance Operations: Premiums on property and
casualty insurance products are recognized as revenues over the term of the
policy using the daily pro rata method.

(g) Policy Acquisition Costs: Policy acquisition costs principally consist of
commissions, premium taxes and other underwriting expenses (net of reinsurance
allowances). If recoverability of such costs from future premiums and related
investment income is not anticipated, the amounts not considered recoverable are
charged to operations.

Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms of
the related policies.

(h) Reinsurance: In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce
the loss that may arise from catastrophes and to limit losses from large
exposures by reinsuring certain levels of risk with other insurance enterprises.
Catastrophe reinsurance treaties serve to reduce property and casualty insurance
risk in geographic areas where the Company is exposed to natural disasters,
primarily the New York metropolitan area. Reinsurance contracts do not
necessarily legally relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders.

Reinsurance recoverables are reported as assets net of provisions for
uncollectible amounts. Premiums earned and other underwriting expenses are
stated net of reinsurance.

(i) Policy Reserves and Unearned Premiums: Liabilities for unpaid losses and
loss adjustment expenses ("LAE") applicable to the property and casualty
insurance operations are determined using case basis evaluations, statistical
analyses for losses incurred but not reported and estimates for salvage and
subrogation recoverable and represent estimates of ultimate claim costs and loss
adjustment expenses. As more information becomes available and claims are

                                       F-8

    -------------------------------

settled, the estimated liabilities are adjusted upward or downward with the
effect of decreasing or increasing net income at the time of adjustment.

(j) Income Taxes: The Company provides for income taxes using the liability
method. The future benefit of certain tax loss carryforwards and future
deductions is recorded as an asset and the provisions for income taxes are not
reduced for the benefit from utilization of tax loss carryforwards. A valuation
allowance is provided if deferred tax assets are not considered more likely than
not to be realized.

(k) Derivative Financial Instruments: The Company enters into interest rate
agreements to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on its customer
banking deposits. The difference between the amounts paid and received is
accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. Cash flows related
to the agreements are classified as operating activities in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, consistent with the interest payments on the
underlying debt. The Company also enters into currency rate swap agreements to
hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Gains and losses on such hedges
are reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The Company does not have
material derivative financial instruments.

(l) Translation of Foreign Currency: Foreign currency denominated investments
and financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange
rates, except that revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange
rates during each reporting period; resulting translation adjustments are
reported as a component of shareholders' equity. Net foreign exchange gains
(losses) were $4,825,000 for 1999 and were not material for 1998 and 1997. Net
unrealized foreign exchange gains (losses) were $(7,023,000) and $211,000 at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

(m) Recently Issued Accounting Standard: In June 1999, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Financial Accounting Standards No. 137, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date
of FASB Statement No. 133 ("SFAS 133")", which will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000.  The Company is reviewing the impact of the
implementation of SFAS 133 on the Company's financial position and results of
operations.

3.  Acquisitions:
    ------------

In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company acquired a 95.4% interest in
Compagnie Fonciere FIDEI ("Fidei"), a French company that is engaged directly
and through subsidiaries in real estate activities, for approximately
$62,300,000, including expenses. In the second quarter of 1999, the Company
acquired the remainder of Fidei for approximately $4,700,000.

During 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Tranex
Credit Corp. ("Tranex"), a subprime automobile lender, for approximately
$128,000,000. Tranex's assets included its $67,900,000 subprime automobile
portfolio, $44,200,000 of residual interests and excess servicing assets of
related securitized trusts and approximately $16,000,000 of certain other
assets.

At December 31, 1998, the Company owned approximately 46% of MK Gold Company
("MK Gold") which was included in the caption "Investments in associated
companies". In October 1999, the Company increased its equity interest to
approximately 72.5% for cash consideration of approximately $15,800,000. During
the third quarter of 1999, MK Gold acquired a company that holds the exploration
and mining rights to the Las Cruces copper deposit in Spain for $42,000,000. MK
Gold is now a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.

4.  Investments in Associated Companies:
    -----------------------------------

The Company has investments in several Associated Companies that have adopted
various fiscal year-ends. The Company records its portion of the earnings of
such companies based on fiscal periods ended up to three months prior to the end
of the Company's reporting period.

The following table provides certain summarized data with respect to the
Associated Companies accounted for on the equity method of accounting included
in 1998 and 1997 results of operations; data for 1999 is not shown due to

In December 1997, the Company invested $20,000,000 to acquire a limited
partnership interest in an investment partnership. During 1998, the Company
recognized income from this partnership of approximately $30,800,000. The
partnership was liquidated during 1999 and income realized from this investment
in 1999 was not significant.

In 1996, the Company formed a joint venture, Pepsi International Bottlers
("PIB") with PepsiCo, Inc. to be the exclusive bottler and distributor of
PepsiCo beverages in a large portion of central and eastern Russia, Kyrgyzstan
and Kazakstan. The Company contributed $79,500,000 to PIB for a 75% equity
interest. Effective as of January 30, 1998, the Company entered into an
agreement with PepsiCo, pursuant to which, among other things, PIB repaid in
full the Company's $77,705,000 bridge financing (which was funded in 1997) and
the Company's equity interest in PIB was reduced to 37.9%. Effective February
1998, the Company discontinued accounting for this investment under the equity
method of accounting as it no longer had any ability to influence PIB. In
February 1999, the Company sold its interest in PIB for approximately
$39,190,000 and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $29,545,000.
However, when combined with the Company's share of the joint venture's losses
since inception, the Company's net loss from this investment was approximately
$40,310,000.

property and casualty insurance subsidiaries were $(20,474,000), $(9,410,000)
and $3,405,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The related statutory surplus was $149,949,000, $199,772,000 and
$217,925,000 at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. As of December

6. Discontinued Operations:
   -----------------------

In September 1998, the Company reinsured, retroactive to January 1, 1998,
substantially all of its life insurance business to Allstate Life Insurance
Company ("Allstate") in an indemnity reinsurance transaction. While the premium
received on this transaction was approximately $28,675,000, the gain on the
reinsurance transaction was deferred and was being amortized into income based
upon actuarial estimates of the premium revenue of the underlying insurance
contracts. In July 1999, the Company sold its life insurance subsidiaries,
Charter and Intramerica, to Allstate for statutory surplus, as adjusted, at the
date of sale (approximately $39,560,000), plus $3,575,000. The Company recorded
a net gain of $15,582,000 in 1999, principally resulting from recognition of
deferred gains from prior reinsurance transactions, including the reinsurance
transaction described above.

In September 1997, the Company completed the sale of the Colonial Penn Life
Group to Conseco, Inc. for $460,000,000, including $400,000,000 in notes
maturing on January 2, 2003 collateralized by non-cancelable letters of credit
and $60,000,000 in cash. These companies were principally engaged in the sale of
graded benefit life insurance policies through direct marketing and agent-sold
Medicare supplement insurance. The Company reported a pre-tax gain of
approximately $271,750,000 on the sale. In connection with the sale of the
Colonial Penn Life Group, the Company reinsured certain life insurance policies
for a premium of $25,000,000. The gain on this reinsurance transaction was
deferred and was being amortized into income based on actuarial estimates of the
premium revenue of the underlying insurance contracts. Upon the closing of the
sale to Allstate described above, the remaining deferred gain was recognized in
income.

In November 1997, the Company completed the sale of the property and casualty
insurance business of the Colonial Penn P&C Group to General Electric Capital
Corporation for total cash consideration of $1,018,100,000, plus $14,300,000 for
retention of certain employee benefit liabilities. The Group's primary business
was providing private passenger automobile insurance to the mature adult
population through direct response marketing. The Company reported a pre-tax
gain of approximately $589,950,000 on the sale.

At December 31, 1999 the Company had an unsecured bank credit facility of
$100,000,000 which bears interest based on the prime rate or LIBOR and matures
in November 2002. $65,500,000 was borrowed under this bank credit facility as of
December 31, 1999.

11.   Indebtedness, continued:
      ------------

The Euro denominated debt, which is non-recourse to the Company, is entirely
related to the acquisition of Fidei.

The Company's debt instruments require maintenance of minimum Tangible Net
Worth, limit distributions to shareholders and limit Indebtedness, as defined in
the agreements. In addition, the debt instruments contain limitations on
investments, liens, contingent obligations and certain other matters. As of
December 31, 1999, cash dividends of approximately $122,000,000 would be
eligible to be paid under the most restrictive covenants.

Under the terms of the indentures of the Company's senior subordinated notes, in
connection with the payment of the dividends described in Note 13, the Company
was required to make an offer to purchase all of its 8 1/4% Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2005 (the "8 1/4% Notes") and its 7 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due
2006 (the "7 7/8% Notes"), at a purchase price of 101% of principal, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Pursuant to such offers, in June 1999, the
Company repurchased $80,899,000 principal amount of the 8 1/4% Notes and
$113,324,000 principal amount of the 7 7/8% Notes for approximately
$198,000,000, including accrued interest. The Company reported an extraordinary
loss on early extinguishment of $3,982,000 ($2,588,000 after taxes or $.04 per
share) in 1999.

The Company reported extraordinary losses on early extinguishment of its 5 1/4%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2003 (the "5 1/4% Debentures") and its
10 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2002 of $3,165,000 ($2,057,000 after taxes
or $.03 per share) in 1997.

Approximately $9,484,000 of the manufacturing division's net property, equipment
and leasehold improvements are pledged as collateral for the Industrial Revenue
Bonds; and approximately $126,800,000 of other assets (primarily investments and
property) are pledged for other indebtedness aggregating approximately
$53,401,000.

Interest rate agreements are used to manage the potential impact of changes in
interest rates on customer banking deposits. Under interest rate swap
agreements, the Company has agreed with other parties to pay fixed rate interest
amounts and receive variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an
agreed notional amount. The variable interest rate portion of the swaps is a
specified LIBOR interest rate. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the notional
amounts of the Company's interest rate swaps were $60,000,000. These interest
rate swaps expire in 2003 and require fixed rate payments of 5.07%. The Company
would have received $3,651,000 at December 31, 1999 and $292,000 at December 31,
1998 on retirement of these agreements. The LIBOR rate at December 31, 1999 was
6.0%. Changes in LIBOR interest rates in the future will change the amounts to
be received under the agreements as well as interest to be paid under the
related variable debt obligations. In connection with the acquisition of Fidei,
the Company borrowed $62,300,000 under its bank credit facility and entered into
currency swap agreements to hedge approximately $55,000,000 of its foreign
currency exposure. The swap agreements were terminated in 1999 and the gain on
such termination (approximately $6,200,000) was deferred as a component of
shareholders' equity.

Counterparties to interest rate and currency swap agreements are major financial
institutions, which management believes are able to fulfill their obligations.
Management believes any losses due to default by the counterparties are likely
to be immaterial.

The aggregate annual mandatory redemptions of debt during the five year period
ending December 31, 2004 are as follows (in thousands): 2000 - $90,282; 2001 -
$62,610; 2002 - $7,057; 2003 - $84,322; and 2004 - $50,101.

The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings (primarily customer
banking deposits) was 6.0% and 5.8% at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

12.  Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust:
     ----------------------------------------

In January 1997, the Company sold $150,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount of
8.65% trust issued preferred securities of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Leucadia
Capital Trust I (the "Trust"). These Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities have an effective maturity date of January 15, 2027 and
represent undivided beneficial interests in the Trust's assets, which consist
solely of $154,640,000 principal amount of 8.65% Junior Subordinated Deferrable
Interest Debentures due 2027 of the Company. Considered together, the "back-up
undertakings" of the Company related to the Trust's preferred securities
constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the Trust's
obligations under the preferred securities. During 1998, a subsidiary of the
Company repurchased $51,800,000 aggregate liquidation amount of the 8.65% trust
issued preferred securities for $42,200,000, plus accrued interest. The
difference between the purchase price and the book value was credited directly
to shareholders' equity, net of taxes.

13.  Common Shares, Stock Options and Preferred Shares:
     -------------------------------------------------

The Board of Directors from time to time has authorized acquisitions of the
Company's Common Shares. In December 1999, the Company's Board of Directors
increased to 6,000,000 the maximum number of shares that the Company is
authorized to purchase. From January 1, 2000 through March 13, 2000, the Company
acquired 1,505,000 Common Shares at an average price of $21.33 per Common Share.
As a result, as of March 13, 2000, the Company is authorized to repurchase
4,495,000 Common Shares.

During 1999, the Company paid aggregate cash dividends of $13.58 per Common
Share, totaling approximately $811,925,000. Pursuant to a ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service, any gain realized on these dividends will be treated
as capital gain income for non-corporate shareholders.

The Company has a fixed stock option plan which provides for grants of options
or rights to non-employee directors and certain employees up to a maximum grant
of 300,000 shares to any individual in a given taxable year. The maximum number
of Common Shares which may be acquired through the exercise of options or rights
under this plan cannot exceed, in the aggregate, 1,200,000. The plan provides
for the issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights at not less than
the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Options
generally become exercisable in five equal annual instalments starting one year
from date of grant. No stock options are outstanding at December 31, 1999. No
stock appreciation rights have been granted.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation", ("SFAS 123"), establishes a fair value method for accounting for
stock-based compensation plans, either through recognition in the statements of
income or disclosure. As permitted, the Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and
related Interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized in the statements of income for its
stock-based compensation plans. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock
option plans been recorded in the statements of income consistent with the
provisions of SFAS 123, the Company's net income and earnings per share for
1999, 1998 and 1997 would not have been materially different from those
reported.

The weighted-average fair value of the options granted was $8.50 per share for
1998 and $6.39 per share for 1997 as estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: (1) expected
volatility of 20.0% for 1998 and 20.3% for 1997; (2) risk-free interest rates of
5.6% for 1998 and 6.1% for 1997; (3) expected lives of 4.0 years for 1998 and
3.7 years for 1997; and (4) dividend yields of .7% for 1998 and .9% for 1997.

At December 31, 1999 and 1998, 6,000,000 preferred shares (redeemable and non-
redeemable), par value $1 per share, were authorized.

Reflected above as recognition of additional tax benefits are reductions to the
Company's income tax provision for the favorable resolution of certain federal
income tax contingencies, in 1999, a $6,800,000 tax benefit from the recognition
of additional capital losses, and, in 1998, a benefit for a change in the
Company's 1997 estimated federal income tax liability. During 1999, the
valuation allowance was reduced by $33,300,000 due to the availability of
capital loss carryforwards to offset a portion of the capital gain from the sale
of the Company's interest in Caja. During 1998 and 1997 certain matters were
favorably resolved and the Company reduced the valuation allowance as reflected
in the above reconciliation.

At December 31, 1999, the Company had tax loss carryforwards of $34,000,000,
which are available to reduce federal income tax payments for the entire
consolidated group, and certain of the Company's subsidiaries had tax loss
carryforwards of $25,000,000, which can only be used to reduce federal income
tax payments for the group that generated the carryforwards. The tax loss
carryforwards of the Company and its subsidiaries have been reflected in the
deferred tax liability after applying the statutory federal income tax rate less
any applicable tax sharing payments to the Internal Revenue Service. The tax
loss carryforwards of the Company expire as follows: $31,000,000 in 2003 through
2010 and $3,000,000 in 2018. The tax loss carryforwards of the Company's
domestic subsidiaries expire in 2002 and 2003. At December 31, 1999, the
Company's foreign subsidiary, Fidei, had tax loss carryforwards of $147,000,000,
of which $103,000,000 expire in 2000 through 2007 and $44,000,000 have no
expiration date.

Limitations exist under the tax law which may restrict the utilization of the
tax loss carryforwards and capital losses can only be used to offset capital
gains. These limitations are considered in the determination of the valuation
allowance.

Under certain circumstances, the value of the carryforwards available could be
substantially reduced if certain changes in ownership were to occur. In order to
reduce this possibility, the Company's certificate of incorporation includes
restrictions which prohibit transfers of the Company's Common Stock under
certain circumstances.

In connection with the sale of certain of the Company's operations in recent
years, the Company had indemnified the purchasers for certain tax matters. The
Company does not believe that such indemnification obligation will result in any
additional material liability to the Company.

17.  Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits:
     -----------------------------------------

The Company has defined contribution pension plans covering certain employees.
Contributions and costs are a percent of each covered employee's salary. Amounts
charged to expense related to such plans were $2,816,000, $1,057,000 and
$1,202,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Prior to 1999, the Company also maintained defined benefit pension plans
covering employees of certain units who also met age and service requirements.
Effective December 31, 1998, the Company froze its defined benefit pension plans
which resulted in the recognition of approximately $6,500,000 of net curtailment
gains.

17.  Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits, continued:
     -----------------------------------------

Several subsidiaries provide certain health care and other benefits to certain
retired employees under plans which are currently unfunded. The Company pays the
cost of postretirement benefits as they are incurred. Amounts credited to
expense (principally amortization of a curtailment gain) related to such
benefits were $1,369,000 in 1999, $1,990,000 in 1998 and $2,851,000 in 1997.

A summary of activity with respect to the Company's postretirement plans for
1999 and 1998 is as follows (in thousands):

                                                         1999           1998

                                                        =======       =======

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 8.00% and 6.75% at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
assumed health care cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation were between 6.0% and 9.0% for 1999, and 6.0%
and 9.5% for 1998, declining to an ultimate rate of between 5.0% and 6.0% by
2006.

If the health care cost trend rates were increased or decreased by 1%, the
accumulated postretirement obligation as of December 31, 1999 would have
increased or decreased by $705,000 and $626,000, respectively. The effect of
these changes on the aggregate of service and interest cost for 1999 would be
immaterial.

18.  Commitments:
     -----------

The Company and its subsidiaries rent office space and office equipment under
non-cancelable operating leases with terms generally varying from one to twenty
years. Rental expense (net of sublease rental income) charged to operations was
$10,964,000 in 1999, $7,680,000 in 1998 and $7,307,000 in 1997. Aggregate
minimum annual rentals (exclusive of real estate taxes, maintenance and certain
other charges) relating to facilities under lease in effect at December 31, 1999
are as follows (in thousands): 2000 - $9,728; 2001 - $9,341; 2002 - $9,211; 2003
- - $8,361; 2004 - $8,683; and thereafter - $101,321. Future minimum sublease
rental income relating to facilities under lease in effect at December 31, 1999
are as follows (in thousands): 2000 - $1,067; 2001 - $1,075; 2002 - $1,085; 2003
- - $1,094; 2004 - $963; and thereafter - $3,203.

Included in the amounts shown above are the gross future minimum annual rental
payments relating to a twenty year lease which the Empire Insurance Group
entered into beginning November 1998 for its executive and administrative
offices. These offices are in an office building in which the Company has an
equity interest. The above amounts have not been reduced for the Company's share
of rental income due to its equity participation in this office building. In
connection with this equity investment, the Company has committed to invest up
to $25,000,000, of which $23,138,000 was invested as of December 31, 1999.

18.  Commitments, continued:
     -----------

In connection with the sale of certain subsidiaries, the Company has made or
guaranteed the accuracy of certain representations given to the acquiror. No
material loss is expected in connection with such matters.

In connection with the sale of the Colonial Penn P&C Group, the Company provided
the purchaser with a $100,000,000 non-cancelable letter of credit to
collateralize certain indemnification obligations. This letter of credit is
collateralized by certain deposits of the Company aggregating approximately
$105,263,000.

The insurance and the banking and lending subsidiaries are limited by regulatory
requirements and agreements in the amount of dividends and other transfers of
funds that are available to the Company. Principally as a result of such
restrictions, the net assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on
transfer of funds to the Company were approximately $259,300,000 at December 31,
1999.

19.  Litigation:
     ----------

The Company is subject to various litigation which arises in the course of its
business. Based on discussions with counsel, management is of the opinion that
such litigation will have no material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position of the Company or its consolidated results of operations.

20.  Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share:
     --------------------------------

For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, there were no
differences in the numerators for the basic and diluted per share computations
for income (loss) from continuing operations before extraordinary loss. These
numerators were $193,429,000, $46,202,000 and $(22,289,000) for 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively. The denominators for basic per share computations were
59,338,000, 63,409,000 and 62,205,000 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
There were no differences for the denominators for diluted per share
computations except for the dilutive effect of approximately 14,000 and 101,000
options for 1999 and 1998, respectively, which had no impact on the per share
amounts.

Options to purchase approximately 887,000 weighted average shares of common
stock were outstanding during the year ended December 31, 1997, but were not
included in the computation of diluted (loss) per share, as those options were
antidilutive. Additionally, during the period January 1, 1997 through April 11,
1997, the 5 1/4% Debentures, which were convertible into approximately 3,478,000
Common Shares, were outstanding. Such debentures were not included in the
computation of diluted (loss) per share, as those debentures were antidilutive.

21.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
     -----------------------------------

The following table presents fair value information about certain financial
instruments, whether or not recognized on the balance sheet. Where quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value
or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by
the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash
flows. The fair value amounts presented do not purport to represent and should
not be considered representative of the underlying "market" or franchise value
of the Company. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of
each class of the financial instruments described below are as follows:


                                      F-28

<PAGE>



21.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments, continued:
     -----------------------------------

(a) Investments: The fair values of marketable equity securities, fixed maturity
securities and investments held for trading purposes (which include securities
sold not owned) are substantially based on quoted market prices, as disclosed in
Note 7.

(b) Cash and cash equivalents: For cash equivalents, the carrying amount
approximates fair value.

(c) Notes receivable on the sales of the Colonial Penn Life Group and Caja: The
fair values of variable rate notes receivable are estimated to be the carrying
amount.

(d) Loan receivables of banking and lending subsidiaries: The fair value of loan
receivables of the banking and lending subsidiaries is estimated by discounting
the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be
made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities.

(e) Investments in associated companies: For 1998, the fair value of Caja is
based upon the sales price as discussed in Note 4. The fair values of a foreign
power company are principally estimated based upon quoted market prices. The
carrying value of the remaining investments in associated companies approximates
fair value.

(f) Customer banking deposits: The fair value of customer banking deposits is
estimated using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining
maturities.

(g) Long-term and other indebtedness: The fair values of non-variable rate debt
are estimated using quoted market prices and estimated rates which would be
available to the Company for debt with similar terms. The fair value of variable
rate debt is estimated to be the carrying amount.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's financial
instruments at December 31, 1999 and 1998 are as follows (in thousands):

22.  Segment Information:
     -------------------

In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information"
("SFAS 131"), which requires a "management" approach for segment disclosure. The
management approach designates the internal organization that is used by
management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
source of the Company's reportable segments. SFAS 131 also requires disclosures
about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.

For information with respect to the Company's segments, see "Financial
Information about Industry Segments" in Item 1, pages 3 and 4, of the Report,
which is incorporated by reference into these consolidated financial statements.

entitled, and the Company agrees to do so, in accordance with the terms and
provisions herein contained;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
convenants and agreements herein contained, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

         1. Deferral of Payments.

         The Company, commencing January 1, 2000 for the calendar year ending
December 31, 2000, shall defer the payment of all compensation to be paid to the
Executive by the Company attributable to services performed or to be performed
by the Executive for the Company at any time. Each deferred payment shall accrue
simple interest (on the basis of a 360-day year), from the first day of the
month immediately following the date on which payment otherwise would have been
made if no deferral had existed (the "first New Month Date") until the date of
actual payment, at a rate of interest equal to the 1-year Treasury bill rate in
effect at each First New Month Date, and the rate of interest shall be reset on
the first day of each subsequent quarter. For purposes hereof, the quarters for
calendar year 2000 shall begin January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1.

         All amounts deferred pursuant to this Agreement, including interest,
shall be payable to the Executive in calendar year 2001 by no later than March
15th of that year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent that
the aggregate deferred payments hereunder (including interest) exceed the
maximum annual amount deductible as compensation by the Company under applicable
U.S. federal tax laws, the Company may make such payments in two or more
installments in different taxable years to permit the Company to obtain the
maximum annual deduction available.

         The Executive shall fully reimburse the Company for the dollar value of
any benefits provided by the Company to the Executive during calendar year 2000
which, in the absence of such reimbursement obligation, would be taxable as
compensation to the Executive if made available to him by the Company without
such obligation.

Such benefits would include, without limitation, the personal use by the
Executive of a Company car, Company airplane, life insurance premiums, etc. This
reimbursement shall include an interest component equal to the minimum rate
permitted to avoid the imposition of any interest under Section 7872 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Amounts to be reimbursed to the
Company under this paragraph shall be paid by Executive upon demand therefor by
the Company, which shall be made in 2001 as promptly as practicable following
availability of the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000.

         The rights of the Executive to the payment of the amounts pursuant to
this Agreement shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured general
creditor of the Company and may not be assigned, pledged or otherwise
transferred by him during his lifetime to any person, whether by operation or
law or otherwise, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar
proceeding. By written notice delivered to the Company, the Executive may
designate (or change a prior designation of) one or more beneficiaries (or his
estate) to receive payment hereunder in the event of his death.

         2. Withholding.

         The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall be
entitled to withhold from his compensation all federal, state, local or other
taxes which the Company determines are required to be withheld on amounts
payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. The Executive
further agrees to indemnify the Company and hold it harmless from and against
any and all taxes (and penalties hereon) and interest with respect thereto
arising out of the Executive's failure to pay fully his tax liability pursuant
to any present or future law, regulation or ordinance of the United States of
America or any state, city or municipality therein.

         3. Governing Law.

         This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

         4. Entire Agreement.

         This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings and arrangements, both oral and written, between the
Parties hereto with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may not be
modified in any manner, execute by a written instrument signed by both the
Company and the Executive.

         5. Notices.

         Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered by hand

         THIS DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENT, (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into on January 10, 2000 by and between LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION, a
New York corporation (the "Company"), and Mark Hornstein (the "Executive"),
collectively the parties ("Parties").

                                   WITNESSETH:
                                   -----------

         WHEREAS, Executive is employed by the Company as Vice President ; and

         WHEREAS, in connection with the provisions of services to the Company
in his capacity as Vice President the Executive desires to defer the receipt of
certain compensation from the Company to which in the future he may become
entitled, and the Company agrees to do so, in accordance with the terms and
provisions herein contained;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
convenants and agreements herein contained, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

         1.       Deferral of Payments.

         The Company shall defer the payment of 50% of bonus compensation that

awarded, remains fully discretionary with the Company.

         Each deferred payment shall accrue simple interest (on the basis of a

equal to the 1-year Treasury bill rate in effect at each First New Month Date,
and the rate of interest shall be reset on the first day of each subsequent
quarter. For purposes hereof, the quarters shall begin January 1, April 1, July
1, and October 1.

         All amounts deferred pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid to the
Executive in two equal installments, plus accrued interest thereon, on the first
business day in January 2003 and 2004. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
to the extent that the aggregate deferred payments hereunder (including
interest) exceed the maximum annual amount deductible as compensation by the
Company under applicable U.S. federal tax laws, the Company may make such
payments in two or more installments in different taxable years to permit the
Company to obtain the maximum annual deduction available.
