ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

GENERAL

          KFX Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, is engaged in the
business of licensing and commercializing a technology that enhances the
combustion characteristics of coal and other carbonaceous solid fuels (the "K-
Fuel Technology" or "Technology").  The K-Fuel Technology uses heat and pressure
to physically and chemically transform high-moisture, low-energy per pound coal
and other organic feedstocks into a lower-moisture, high-energy solid fuel ("K-
Fuel").

          The K-Fuel Technology is comprised of three groups, or Series, of
patents.  The Series "A" and Series "B" Technology patents are based on hot gas
and steam heat-transfer mediums, respectively.  The Series "C" Technology is
based on a nitrogen heat-transfer medium.  The principal difference between the
Series "A" and "B" Technologies and the Series "C" Technology is that Series "C"
is based on a more simplified design with respect to the manufacturing equipment
and facilities, resulting in lower capital costs.  The Company anticipates that
the Series "C" Technology will be primarily used for coal product manufacturing
facilities, whereas the Series "A" and "B" Technologies will be primarily used
for renewable resource (e.g., bagasse, municipal solid waste, sludge and wood
waste, collectively referred to as "biomass") fuel product manufacturing
facilities.  The Company is currently focusing all of its commercialization
efforts on the development of projects for the manufacture of coal fuel product
using the Series "C" Technology.  However, the Company intends to pursue the
development of biomass fuel manufacturing plants at such time as a sufficient
revenue stream exists from coal product plants.  To date, one commercial-scale
K-Fuel manufacturing facility has been constructed and is operational.  See
"Current Projects - KFX Fuel Partners."
                    -----------------  

          In the Series "C" process, raw coal is crushed and screened before it
is introduced into a steel alloy processing vessel that is then pressurized and
heated indirectly using vertical tube heat exchangers.  Nitrogen, serving as an
inert, non-oxidizing heat-transfer medium, is admitted to the tube side of the
processing vessel at a pressure of approximately 125 pounds per square inch
("psi").  After the nitrogen is inserted, it picks up heat from the walls of the
tube and gradually expands to approximately 800 psi.  Water is released from the
coal during this expansion period.  When the temperature in the tubes reaches in
excess of 520 degrees Fahrenheit, any water remaining in the coal turns to steam
and continues to process the raw coal.  When the temperature of the coal reaches
approximately 650 to 740 degrees Fahrenheit, the process is complete.  The
process takes 30 to 40 minutes to complete from initial loading of the raw coal
into the processing vessels to final discharge of finished K-Fuel product.

          The principal benefit of the K-Fuel Technology in the United States is
that the fuel produced from the process can allow electric power producers,
manufacturers and other large-scale users of coal to meet the clean air
standards imposed by the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 (the "CAAA").  The principal benefit of the K-Fuel Technology
in foreign markets is that low-rank indigenous coal reserves can be upgraded to
provide a more cost effective and less environmentally damaging fuel source for
power producers, manufacturers and households, either in internal markets or for
export.

                                       1

Domestic Market

          The CAAA is the primary stimulus for the developing United States
market for beneficiated clean coal fuel products.  Specifically, Title IV of the
CAAA addresses acid rain, which is largely caused by airborne sulfur dioxide
(SO\\2\\) particulates emitted from coal-fired power plants and other industrial
facilities.  The K-Fuel Technology addresses this problem by producing a coal
fuel product that has SO\\2\\ emissions significantly below the levels required
by the CAAA (the level of reduction can vary with the chemical composition of
the coal feedstock).

          Title IV of the CAAA specifies a two-phase implementation schedule
that primarily targets electric utility companies with annual generating
capacities in excess of 25 megawatts (MW).  Phase I implementation began on
January 1, 1995, and affected 110 large, high-emission generating plants in 21
states (primarily in the industrial midwest).  The emissions limit for these
plants during Phase I is 2.5 lbs. SO\\2\\ per million Btu (MMBtu) of heat
output.  Phase II will begin in the year 2000 and will affect over 1,400
electrical generating plants and other industrial users of coal.  The effective
SO\\2\\ emission rate limitation under Phase II will be reduced to 1.2 lbs.
SO\\2\\ per MMBtu.  When using Wyoming Powder River Basin ("PRB") coal as
feedstock material, the K-Fuel Technology produces a fuel product that has a
SO\\2\\ emission rate of approximately 0.7 to 1.0 lbs. SO\\2\\ per MMBtu.

          The Company's United States marketing emphasis is directed at electric
utility companies and industrial coal users located in the industrial midwest
states.  The combustion characteristics of cyclone furnace boilers, a common
boiler type of midwestern utilities originally designed to burn high-sulfur
midwestern coal, are particularly well-suited to the K-Fuel product manufactured
from PRB coal.  As reported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the total domestic
market for coal fuel is approximately 1 billion tons per year ("TPY"), of which
the majority of the tonnage (in excess of 80 percent) is used by electric
utility companies.  Coal-fired electricity generation currently accounts for
approximately 55 percent of the nation's total electricity supply.  The Company
has estimated, based on published utility coal consumption data and responses to
Phase I and Phase II requirements of the CAAA, that a market of approximately
100 to 150 million TPY of clean coal fuel products will develop between the year
2000 and  2010.  This anticipated market assumes that regulations passed under
the CAAA remain in force.  Any amendments to the CAAA that reduce the specified
limits on industrial SO\\2\\ emissions could negatively impact the potential
size of the market and the domestic growth prospects of the Company.  In
addition to the electric utility industry, the Company intends to market the K-
Fuel product to manufacturers and other industrial coal users that are either
subject to the SO\\2 \\provisions of the CAAA or that desire to improve their
fuel combustion performance.

Foreign Markets

          The international coal market is approximately four times the size of
the United States market. The Company's objective is to concentrate on markets
where there is either a significant need for more energy efficient and
environmentally responsible fuel products, or where abundant coal reserves can
be utilized in conjunction with the K-Fuel Technology to develop a value-added
export product. The Company is currently focusing its international
commercialization efforts in Indonesia and Turkey, and to a lesser extent in the
Czech Republic. See "Current Projects."

Strategic Relationships

          The Company believes that it can maximize it's chances for long-term
success in the development of the K-Fuel Technology, both domestically and
internationally, by means of strategic relationships with mature, well-
positioned companies already operating in the Company's intended markets, or
that have a value-added technology or service that complements the K-Fuel
Technology.  To that end, the Company has successfully negotiated and entered
into separate strategic relationships with Thermo Ecotek Corporation and
Kennecott Energy and Coal Company.

          Thermo Ecotek Corporation.  In August 1995, the Company entered into a
          -------------------------                                             
Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), with Thermo Ecotek
Corporation ("TCK"), a Waltham, Massachusetts environmental company engaged
primarily in non-utility electric power generation using environmentally
responsible technologies.   Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, in 1995 TCK
purchased 3 million shares of the Company's common stock for $6 million,
representing an ownership in the Company of approximately 14 percent as of
December 31, 1996.  In January 1997, TCK purchased an additional 1.25 million
shares of the Company's common stock for $2.5 million, increasing its ownership
in the Company to approximately 18 percent.  The Stock Purchase Agreement also
provided TCK with a warrant ("Warrant A") to purchase an additional 7,750,000
shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $3.65 per share,
exercisable beginning on January 1, 2000 and expiring on July 1, 2001.  TCK also
obtained another warrant ("Warrant B"), that gives it the right to purchase the
number of shares of common stock of the Company that, when added to all shares
owned by TCK on the exercise date, including any shares acquired by the exercise
of Warrant A, would be sufficient to give TCK ownership of 51 percent of the
outstanding common stock of the Company, on a fully diluted basis.  Warrant B
has the same exercise and termination dates as Warrant A.  In August 1995, the
Company and TCK entered into a separate agreement to construct and operate a
500,000 TPY commercial-scale K-Fuel production facility.  See "Current Projects
- - KFX Fuel Partners."
  -----------------  

          Kennecott Energy and Coal Company.   In April 1996,  the Company
          ----------------------------------                              
entered into a joint venture agreement (the "Kennecott Agreement") with
Kennecott Alternative Fuels, Inc. ("KAFI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Kennecott Energy and Coal Company ("KECC").  The joint venture, a Delaware
limited liability company named K-Fuel, L.L.C. ("K-Fuel LLC"), will be the
vehicle for further technical advancement and the commercialization of business
opportunities arising out of the K-Fuel Technology, including research and
development, sublicensing, marketing and consulting, but not including any
actual construction of facilities to produce K-Fuel products on a commercial
basis ("Commercial Projects").   Commercial Projects will be constructed by
separate entities in which KAFI, the Company or both will have an equity
interest and which will receive a sublicense from K-Fuel LLC for the K-Fuel
Technology.

          Initially, the Company has a 51 percent ownership interest in K-Fuel
LLC and KAFI has a 49 percent interest.  Certain research and development and
amortization expenses are allocated 100 percent to KAFI.  At such time as
entities in which KAFI has an equity interest have placed into service
Commercial Projects with a collective design capacity equal to or in excess of 3
million TPY of K-Fuel product, KAFI will have a 51 percent interest in K-Fuel
LLC and the Company will have a 49 percent interest.  In addition to a fee of $1
million paid to the Company in 1996 to enter into the K-Fuel LLC joint venture,
and subject to certain conditions, KAFI has agreed to pay to K-Fuel LLC such
amounts as may be necessary for all research and development costs incurred by
K-Fuel LLC, up to $4 million.  During 1996, KAFI funded such research and
development costs totaling approximately $1.44 million.

          In connection with the Kennecott Agreement, the Company granted K-Fuel
LLC an exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, royalty-free right and license
(including the right to grant sublicenses) to and under the K-Fuel Technology,
except to the extent that it pertains to the beneficiation or restructuring of
coal or coal related feedstocks covered under the HFC License (as defined below)
(the "KFX License"). In addition, Heartland Fuels Corporation, an 85 percent-
owned subsidiary of the Company, granted K-Fuel LLC an exclusive, worldwide,
fully-paid, royalty-free right and license (including the right to grant
sublicenses) to and under the Series "A" and Series "B" K-Fuel Technology, as it
pertains to the beneficiation or restructuring of coal or coal-related
feedstocks (the "HFC License"). Both the KFX License and the HFC License specify
minimum terms and provisions for any sublicenses granted by K-Fuel LLC to third
parties.

                                       3

          With respect to future Commercial Projects to be licensed by K-Fuel
LLC, the Company is entitled to a one-time license fee based on the annual
designed capacity of each project, to be paid  one-half at the time the license
is granted, with the remaining one-half paid over a period of three years
beginning when the project begins commercial operations.  The Company will also
receive a production royalty, to be paid each calendar quarter, depending on
certain levels of the projects' selling price per ton of coal product.
Additionally, the Company will be entitled to an additional payment based on a
percentage of the excess of (1) annual cash revenue from each project, over (2)
annual pre-tax cash operating costs of each project plus an annual capital
charge ("Bonus Royalty") related to each project.  The Kennecott Agreement
provides that KAFI will fund 100 percent of the capital requirements for each
Commercial Project that it elects to participate in, provided however that the
Company retains the option to fund and invest up to 50 percent of the capital
requirements for any Commercial Project.  As of December 31, 1996, there were no
commitments to construct any Commercial Projects under the Kennecott Agreement.

Current Projects

          KFX Fuel Partners.   In August 1995, the Company and TCK, acting
          ------------------                                              
through wholly-owned subsidiaries KFX Wyoming, Inc. ("KFX Wyoming", 100 percent
owned by the Company) and Eco Fuels, Inc. (100 percent owned by TCK), formed KFX
Fuel Partners, L.P. ("KFP"), a Delaware limited partnership, and began
construction of a 500,000 TPY K-Fuel coal production facility (the "KFP
Project") near Gillette, Wyoming using the Company's Series "C" Technology.  The
Company has a 5 percent interest in KFP, with the remaining 95 percent held by
TCK.  The KFP Project was substantially completed in December 1996.  On December
24, 1996, a fire destroyed one of two oil heating systems that provide the main
processing structure (comprised of four processing vessels) with heat transfer
fluid.  It is estimated that KFP's insurance coverage will cover substantially
all of the costs of replacing the destroyed equipment.  Commercial operations of
the KFP Project (i.e., shipment of fuel product to purchasers or stockpiling of
product on the KFP site) are expected to begin in the second quarter of 1997 for
the two processing vessels unaffected by the fire, and in the second half of
1997 for the other two processing vessels that were served by the oil heater
destroyed in the fire.  The KFP Project is expected to reach its full output of
500,000 TPY beginning in 1998.   TCK is the managing general partner for KFP and
makes all day-to-day operating decisions.

          In addition to its 5 percent ownership of KFP, the Company will
receive a production royalty of 3 percent of the gross sales of KFP, payable
quarterly.  See "Patents, Licenses and Royalty Agreements." The Company, in
conjunction with K-Fuel LLC, is also performing certain marketing activities for
KFP.  The terms of any compensation for those activities are being negotiated by
the parties.

          KFP has signed a Fuel Supply Agreement (the "FSA")  with Ohio Valley
Electric Corporation ("OVEC"), a subsidiary of American Electric Power, Inc.
("AEP"), whereby KFP will supply K-Fuel to OVEC upon the satisfactory completion
of the test burn procedure described in the FSA.  The term of the FSA will
commence upon the commencement of commercial operations of the KFP Project and
will continue until December 31, 1999 (the "Original Term").  The term may be
extended, at the option of OVEC, for a period of up to 120 months (the "Initial
Extended Term"), and may be extended further, at the option of OVEC, for a
period up to 60 months beyond the Initial Extended Term.  KFP's initial shipment
of K-Fuel product to OVEC is expected to be in the second or third quarter of
1997.  Total tonnage as per the FSA over the Original Term is 500,000 tons.
See "Patents, Licenses and Royalty Agreements."

          KFP also has a test-burn contract with Wisconsin Power & Light for
approximately 30,000 tons of K-Fuel product to be delivered by the end of 1998.

          KFP has a coal feedstock supply agreement for the KFP Project with
Fort Union, Ltd. ("Fort Union") that expires upon the earlier of (1) the
delivery to the KFP Project of a cumulative sum of 750,000 tons, or (2) December
31, 1997.   See "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES."

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
          The KFP Project qualifies for a tax credit available under Section 29
of the United States Internal Revenue Code entitled "Credit for Producing Fuel
From a Nonconventional Source" ("Section 29").  Section 29, which was originally
adopted in 1980, provides a tax credit to the producer of fuel from alternative
sources.  The credit is equal to $3.00 in 1979 dollars for each barrel
equivalent of crude oil ("OBE"), which is defined as 5.8 million Btu.  In 1995
dollars, the phase out of the credit begins as the reference price of oil (the
average price of oil for the year as announced by the Secretary of the Treasury)
exceeds $46.68 per barrel and is fully phased out if the reference price exceeds
$57.35.  For 1995 the reference price was $14.62 per barrel.  Section 29 applies
to qualified fuels which are produced in a facility placed in service before
July 1, 1998, pursuant to a binding written contract in effect before January 1,
1997, and which are sold after December 1992 and before January 2008.
Calculated in 1995 dollars, the tax credit is currently valued at $24.94 per ton
of the K-Fuel product (assuming a K-Fuel Btu content of 12,400 Btu per pound).
The credit per OBE and the phase-out prices for oil are adjusted annually for
inflation.

          Other than alternative minimum tax provisions, generally there is no
provision for carrybacks or carryovers in the event the taxpayer cannot use the
entire alternative fuel production credit available for the taxable year. There
are also no recapture provisions which apply to this credit.

          K-Fuel LLC.   In January 1997, the Company and KAFI summarized its
          -----------                                                       
findings and recommendations resulting from the research and development work of
K-Fuel LLC in 1996.  The 1996 research and development program is part of the
first phase of an expected two-phase program.  The first phase is expected to be
completed in the second quarter of 1997, with the second phase expected to begin
shortly thereafter and be completed in 1998.

          The balance of the first phase of the research and development program
will be primarily devoted to product reactivity and dusting.  The second phase
will be devoted to development of a new processing vessel design, including the
expected construction of a small demonstration plant based on the new vessel
design.  KAFI will fund 100 percent of the remaining research and development
program of K-Fuel LLC, up to the specified amount of $4 million in the Kennecott
Agreement.

          KFX Fuel Partners II.  In December 1996, the Company formed KFX Fuel
          ---------------------                                               
Partners II, L.P. ("KFP II"), a Delaware limited partnership, in connection with
an anticipated 635,000 TPY K-Fuel plant project ("KFP II Project") to be
constructed on a site adjacent to the existing KFP Project near Gillette,
Wyoming.  The KFP II Project, if successfully financed, will be owned by third
party entities and the Company in ownership percentages yet to be determined.
The Company is currently negotiating financing terms and conditions with certain
third party entities, and is working to have the KFP II Project closed with
respect to financing and construction and operating permits in the second
quarter of 1997.  The success of attracting financing and ownership partners to
the KFP II Project is highly dependent on the availability of the Section 29 tax
credit.  As the credit is available only to production facilities constructed
and placed in service by July 1, 1998, the logistics and construction lead times
necessary to have a facility completed by that date require that financing and
permitting activities be completed and construction underway by the end of the
second quarter of 1997.  In November 1996, the Company submitted an authority to
construct permit application to the Air Quality Division of the Wyoming
Department of Environmental Quality, which the Company expects will be granted
in the second quarter of 1997.  See "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS."

          Indonesia.   In September 1995, KFX Indonesia, a joint venture between
          ----------                                                            
the Company and RCD Development, a Maryland partnership ("RCD"), entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding with PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam ("PTBA"), an
Indonesian state-owned coal-mining company, to jointly undertake a feasibility
study on the commercialization of the K-Fuel Technology in Indonesia using
PTBA's high-moisture coal as feedstock.  KAFI, through its interest in K-Fuel
LLC, subsequently  participated in the feasibility study.  In 1996, KFX
Indonesia, KAFI and PTBA completed the feasibility study and  identified a
potential K-Fuel project on the southern portion of the Indonesian island of
Sumatra ("Indonesia Project").   The proposed Indonesia Project is an
approximately 1.5 million metric ton-per-year ("MTPY") facility, with an
estimated development and construction cost of approximately $160 million,
including approximately $21 million to develop an existing coal reserve of PTBA
estimated at approximately 180 million metric tons.  In 1997 or 1998, KFX
Indonesia, KAFI and PTBA expect to complete detailed engineering studies of the
proposed mining and K-Fuel plant sites to further determine the viability of the
Indonesia Project.  The costs needed to complete these studies are expected to
be paid by KAFI and PTBA.  Furthermore, the Company expects to have no direct
financial ownership in the initial Indonesia Project other than its license
fees, royalties and Bonus Royalty.  The funding for the Indonesia Project, other
than the feasibility study costs incurred in 1996, is expected to be funded 100
percent by KAFI and PTBA.   It is possible that PTBA will participate in the
Indonesia Project only as a supplier of raw coal feedstock, rather than being
the coal supplier and a partner in the Indonesia Project.  Also, with the
Company's consent, KAFI may transfer its rights of participation in the
Indonesia Project to one or more international affiliates.   There are no
assurances that the Indonesia Project or other possible future projects in
Indonesia will be constructed.

          In January 1997, the Company and K-Fuel LLC entered into an amended
agreement with RCD regarding certain future performance fees related to a
successful Indonesia K-Fuel project.  In the event that the Company and/or K-
Fuel LLC construct or license an Indonesia K-Fuel project utilizing at least 25
percent raw coal feedstock supplied by PTBA, RCD would be entitled to a fee of
$2.00 per U.S. short ton (2,000 lbs.) for the first 1.5 million tons of
installed capacity, and a fee of $1.33 per ton for the second 1.5 million tons
of installed capacity.  The fees RCD derives from individual K-Fuel projects in
Indonesia supplied by PTBA coal are not expected to impact the license fees or
royalties the Company would separately receive under its license agreement with
K-Fuel LLC.

           Turkey. In June 1996, the Company entered into a non-binding
           ------
memorandum of understanding with Soma Komur Isletmerleri A.S. ("SOMA"), a
Turkish private coal-mining company, to cooperate in the development of a
proposed 500,000 TPY K-Fuel project in the Soma Basin coal-mining region in
western Turkey ("Turkey Project"). The intended use of K-Fuel from the Turkey
Project would be for household heating markets in the urban areas of Izmir and
Bursa.

          To date there are no definitive agreements with respect to a Turkey K-
Fuel production facility, and the Company is not able to predict if or when a K-
Fuel production facility will be constructed in Turkey.

          Czech Republic.   The Company has formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in
          ---------------                                                      
the Czech Republic, KFx Bohemia, s.r.o., to hold the Company's interest in a
proposed Czech joint venture called Ceska Palivova.  In January 1995, the
Company entered into a Letter of Intent with Severoceske doly a.s.
("Severoceske"), a Czech mining company.  Pursuant to the Letter of Intent, the
Company and Severoceske began work in 1995 on the technical, manufacturing and
marketing feasibility studies to identify a suitable K-Fuel project.  The Letter
of Intent expired in January 1996, but the Company expects to continue to work
with Severoceske or other Czech companies to construct a K-Fuel project.

          To date there are no definitive agreements with respect to a Czech
Republic K-Fuel production facility, and the Company is not able to predict if
or when a K-Fuel production facility will be constructed in the Czech Republic.

PATENTS, LICENSES AND ROYALTY AGREEMENTS

          The Company has patents or patent applications to the K-Fuel
Technology registered in the United States and 46 foreign countries, including
all major industrialized countries that either have significant reserves of
high-moisture lignite or subbituminous coal, or that are readily accessible to
such reserves via large-scale transportation infrastructure (primarily ocean
barge vessels).

          The only licenses the Company has granted to the K-Fuel Technology are
to the KFP Project (Series "C"), K-Fuel LLC ("Series C"), and Heartland Fuels
Corporation ("HFC") (Series "A" and "B").  The Company owns 85 percent of the
common stock of HFC, and as a condition of the Kennecott Agreement, the Company
caused HFC to grant to K-Fuel LLC an exclusive sublicense to the Series "A" and
"B" Technologies.

          In connection with the KFP Project, the Company and OVEC entered into
a Fuel Option Agreement (the "OVEC Fuel Option Agreement") in 1995 whereby, in
the event OVEC exercises its option to extend the Original Term of the FSA for
the full 120-month period of the Initial Extended Term, OVEC will have the right
to designate, and, if designated, the obligation to provide, at the Company's
expense, one or more sites suitable for the location of plants for the
processing of K-Fuel.  Upon the Company's determination at the time of each such
designation that the plant will be commercially viable, the Company or an
affiliate thereof, and OVEC and/or Indiana Kentucky Corporation, a subsidiary of
AEP, shall promptly thereafter negotiate in good faith and enter into a purchase
agreement whereby OVEC will purchase the K-Fuel produced by any such plant built
by the Company on terms and conditions substantially similar to those in the
FSA.  In the event the Company decides not to proceed with the construction of
such plant, the Company is obligated to grant OVEC a non-exclusive license for
the Series "C" Technology to enable OVEC to proceed with the development and
construction of such plant, and OVEC is required to pay the Company a royalty of
$0.65 per ton on any fuel produced at such plant.  Additionally, the Company
entered into a Fuel Option Agreement with I&M dated August 17, 1995 (the "I&M
Fuel Option Agreement") which provides that under certain circumstances I&M
shall have the same rights as OVEC pursuant to the OVEC Fuel Option Agreement.

          A predecessor entity of the Company acquired the Series "A" and "B"
Technologies from Edward Koppelman and other investors (the "Koppelman Group")
in 1984 by means of a cash payment of $10 million and a royalty agreement of $90
million.  The royalty agreement was subsequently amended to provide that the
Company would pay Mr. Koppelman approximately $75.7 million, and Theodore
Venners, the Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, would pay
the Koppelman Group approximately $14.2 million.  The royalty agreement with Mr.
Koppelman was amended in 1996 to make royalty payments to him from the Company
based on 25 percent of the Company's license fees and royalties.  The royalties
due to Mr. Koppelman are to be computed after the royalties due to the State of
Wyoming ("State") as a result of a debt extinguishment agreement with the State
in 1994.  Mr. Koppelman was advanced $500,000 of future royalties in 1996 in
exchange for amending the royalty agreement, which included a promissory note of
$200,000.  The $500,000 advance reduces the total amount owed to Mr. Koppelman
under the royalty agreement to approximately $75.2 million.  Also as part of the
royalty agreement, Mr. Koppelman has agreed to indemnify the Company and Mr.
Venners for any claims made by the Koppelman Group.

GOVERNMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

          In the United States, the K-Fuel product is not expected to be subject
to significant amounts of local, state or federal regulation with respect to its
transportation and distribution.  However, any future United States production
plants will require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from
appropriate federal, state and local governmental agencies before construction
of each facility can begin, and will be subject to periodic maintenance and
review requirements once facilities begin production.  Typically, most
permitting requirements are governed by state laws, but the United States
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has the authority to overrule state
permitting decisions.  The following types of permits are typically required for
commercial production facilities: (a) air quality, (b) wastewater discharge, (c)
land use, and (d) hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal.  KFP has in
place all permits for the operation of the KFP Project, and the Company expects
no difficulties in obtaining the necessary permits for the KFP II Project,
although no assurances can be given that such permits will be granted.  The K-
Fuel Technology process generates only waste gas, waste discharge water, and a
small amount of fuel liquid as by-products of the process.  The KFP Project has,
as will all future production facilities, waste gas and water treatment
facilities to properly treat and dispose of the waste by-products.

          The Company currently has an operating permit in the name of KFX
Wyoming, issued by the Land Quality Division of the Wyoming Department of
Environmental Quality ("DEQ"), that encompasses all of the operating activities
of the KFP Project, the proposed KFP II Project, and the Company's mine property
adjacent to the KFP Project site (see "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES").  The operating
permit issued by DEQ governs the current day-to-day operating activities of both
KFP and KFX Wyoming with respect to the permitted area, as well as the future
reclamation obligations to return the project site to its original condition.
Each year, the permit is reviewed by DEQ for compliance with specified operating
procedures and the appropriateness of the estimated future reclamation costs for
the project site.  The 1997 annual permit review was submitted to DEQ in
December 1996 and is expected to be approved by DEQ no later than May 1997.  The
total reclamation obligations of KFP, KFP II and KFX Wyoming are currently

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
estimated at approximately $3,352,000, including certain contingency amounts
required under Wyoming law.  Upon approval of the 1997 operating permit by DEQ,
KFX Wyoming and KFP will each be required to obtain reclamation bonds as
collateral to the DEQ for the estimated reclamation obligations.  The
reclamation obligations of the KFP II Project will be assessed only if the KFP
II Project is constructed.  The future reclamation obligation of KFX Wyoming as
submitted in the 1997 annual permit review is approximately $1,166,000. The
Company expects that there will be no significant reclamation requirements in
1997.
 
          Future international K-Fuel production plants will also be subject to
various permitting and operational regulations specific to each country.
Generally, environmental permitting and operating regulations in the countries
the Company has targeted for international development (i.e., Indonesia, Turkey
and the Czech Republic) are not as stringent as those in the United States.

COMPETITION

          To the Company's knowledge, there are currently no competitors
producing significant commercial quantities of beneficiated clean coal fuel
products either in the United States or in international markets.  However,
there are other clean coal technology ("CCT") companies, primarily in the United
States, that are developing fuel combustion and product technologies that would
reduce emission pollutants and/or increase the heating value of coal feedstock
fuel sources.  Many of these CCT competitors have greater financial, technical
and operational resources than the Company.

          Carbontec Energy Corporation, a North Dakota corporation
("Carbontec"), had previously announced plans for an approximately 2 million TPY
coal beneficiation plant in the PRB to be operational in late 1996 or early
1997. To date, this project has not begun construction. The Carbontec technology
produces beneficiated coal that has a heating content of approximately 10,500 to
11,000 Btu per pound, as compared to K-Fuel produced from PRB coal that has a
heating content of approximately 11,500 to 12,500 Btu per pound.

          ENCOAL, a joint venture of SGI International, Inc. and Ziegler Coal
Holdings, has a demonstration facility in the PRB that is currently capable of
producing approximately 100,000 TPY of Process Derived Fuel ("PDF"), a solid,
low-sulfur fuel product for use in utility boilers that has a heating content of
approximately 11,500 Btu per pound. ENCOAL has announced plans for a 6 million
TPY (coal feedstock quantity) coal beneficiation plant in the PRB, with
construction to begin by mid-1997, pending the successful permitting and
financing of the project. The ENCOAL process also produces a liquid fuel product
known as Coal Derived Liquid ("CDL").

          Rosebud-Syncoal, a joint venture of Montana Power and an affiliate of
Northern States Power, has a demonstration facility at Montana Power's Rosebud
coal mine near Colstrip, Montana.  The Syncoal facility is currently capable of
producing approximately 300,000 TPY of beneficiated coal that has a heating
content of approximately 11,800 Btu per pound.

          In the United States market, the Company must also compete with other
naturally low-sulfur coals.   Also, sulfur dioxide emission credits ("emission
credits") allow non-compliance users of higher sulfur coal to bundle coal
purchases with these emission credits to meet the CAAA requirements.  Because of
an over-compliance situation that has developed in Phase I of the CAAA, there is
currently an abundant supply of emission credits in the U.S. market.  However,
Phase II implementation of the CAAA beginning in January 2000 is expected to
result in a decreasing availability of emission credits.  Additionally, existing
supplies of naturally low-sulfur coal are continually being depleted.

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
          The Company is not able to predict the impact that competing coal
beneficiation technologies, the availability and pricing of low-sulfur coal
reserves, or the availability and pricing of emission credits will have on the
future competitive position of the Company.  The Company believes that its
current competitive advantage is its expectation of having the KFP Project
operational in 1997 to prove the K-Fuel Technology in the early stages of a
developing worldwide market that is expected to grow significantly in the
future.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

          In 1996 and 1995, the Company incurred approximately $1,198,000 and
$816,000, respectively, in research and development ("R&D") expenses (including
demonstration plant and laboratory operating expenses) to further refine and
develop the K-Fuel Technology process.  Substantially all of the Company's R&D
expenses in 1996 and 1995 have been to test the design and operating
characteristics of planned production facilities (e.g., product loading and
handling requirements, storage and transportation characteristics, etc.).   In
1997, the Company expects to decrease its R&D expenses because of its
relationship with K-Fuel LLC and that entity's planned R&D activities.  The
Company will continue to operate its Gillette, Wyoming demonstration facility in
1997 in a supporting role to K-Fuel LLC and KFP.  See "ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES."

EMPLOYEES

          The Company currently has 17 full-time employees who work in the areas
of marketing, finance and administration, and research and development.  The
Company considers its relations with all employees to be excellent.

                                      10

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

          For its principal executive offices, the Company has leased
approximately 5,900 square feet of office space for a period of five years
ending September 30, 2000 located at 1999 Broadway, Suite 3200, Denver, Colorado
80202. The base rent under the lease is $6,783 per month; the Company is also
obligated to pay, as additional rent, allocable operating costs. The Company has
a right of refusal on additional adjacent office space, and has the option to
renew the lease for one additional five-year term.

          The Company has leased approximately 2,500 square feet of office space
for a period of five years ending June 30, 1998 located at 901 North Stuart
Street, Suite 750, Arlington, Virginia 22203.  The base rent under the lease is
approximately $4,452 per month, with escalations of 3 percent for each
subsequent year of the lease term.  The Company is also obligated to pay, as
additional rent, allocable operating costs.  The Company has the option to renew
the lease for one additional five-year term.

          The Company, through its KFX Technology, Inc. ("KFXT") subsidiary,
owns a demonstration plant and leases from KFP (on a rent-free basis) a research
and development laboratory adjacent to the KFP Project (the "Gillette
Facility").  The Gillette Facility is located on approximately 80 acres of land,
inside the rail loop of Fort Union Mine, in Campbell County, Wyoming,
approximately 5 miles northeast of Gillette, Wyoming.  The Gillette Facility is
comprised of three buildings totaling approximately 7,100 square feet.

          In 1995, the Company acquired the Fort Union Mine ("Pit 1"), which
consists of approximately 1,002 acres of surface and coal lands located
northeast of Gillette, Campbell County, Wyoming, and a coal loadout facility
located on a railroad loop connecting to the Burlington Northern Railroad.
Recoverable coal lying within Pit 1 is approximately 1.3 million tons.  In 1997,
the Company intends to transfer ownership of approximately 348 acres of surface
land to KFP.


ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          In November 1995, the Company filed a lawsuit against Fru-Con
Construction Corporation and Fru-Con Engineering, Inc. (collectively, "Fru-Con")
in the Wyoming State Court, 6th Judicial District. The action has been removed
to the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. The Company's
lawsuit requests that the court enter a judgement that Fru-Con has no interest
or claim in or against the Company or any of the Company's property or
interests, or that Fru-Con is barred from such claims. Fru-Con had asserted
claims for approximately $1.8 million for engineering services and an interest
in K-Fuel plants built in North America by virtue of contractual arrangements
with a limited partnership sponsored by corporations in which a predecessor
entity to the Company had a partnership interest. Because the work done by Fru-
Con was for a limited partnership in which the Company's predecessor entity was
not a partner, and because payment for the work performed by Fru-Con was
contingent upon successful project financing which never materialized, as well
as for other legal and factual reasons, the Company believes that Fru-Con has no
valid rights or claims against the Company. Accordingly, the Company believes
that the ultimate resolution of this action will not have a material adverse
impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.


ITEM 4.   SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

          No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders
during the fourth quarter of 1996.

          Beginning January 30, 1996, the Company's common stock was traded on
the American Stock Exchange (under the trading symbol "KFX").  During the year
ended December 31, 1995 and from January 1 to January 29, 1996, the common stock
traded on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market (under the trading symbol "KFXI").  The
following table presents the reported high and low bid prices for the common
stock on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market and the reported sales prices on the
American Stock Exchange for the two-year period ended December 31, 1996.  With
respect to NASDAQ SmallCap Market prices, the bid prices reflect interdealer
quotations, without retail markup, markdown or commission, and do not

          This 10-K filing contains, in addition to historical information,
forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties.  The Company's
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-
looking statements.  Factors that might cause such a difference include those
discussed below, as well as general economic and business conditions, regulatory
changes, competition, the acceptance of new product offerings and other factors
discussed elsewhere in this 10-K.  The Company undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be
made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the
occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

OVERVIEW

          Excluding the joint venture fee of $1 million in 1996, to date the
Company has not generated any other material revenues from the licensing of the
K-Fuel Technology to third party licensees or the direct manufacturing of K-Fuel
product.  All revenues other than the joint venture fee in 1996 have been
derived from ancillary sources not directly related to the Company's efforts to
commercialize the K-Fuel Technology.  Net losses before extraordinary items and
income taxes were approximately $6.1 million, $8.8 million and $5.6 million in
1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively. The KFP Project is the only commercial-
scale K-Fuel production facility constructed to date.  Until the Company
successfully negotiates additional third-party licensing and royalty agreements
and / or independently constructs and operates additional commercial-scale
production facilities, net operating losses will continue.   The royalties and
profit interests to be derived from the Company's 5 percent ownership interest
in the KFP Project will not be sufficient to meet all of the operating and debt
service needs of the Company based on current and future anticipated operating
plans and budgets.  Until such time as the Company has in place sufficient
additional commercial-scale production facilities (either owned independently or
through joint venture entities similar to the KFP Project) to generate positive
cash flow from operations, the Company will be dependent on additional debt
and/or equity financing.  The Company expects that most or all of its financing
needs in 1997 with respect to day-to-day operations and debt service
requirements will be provided by the January 1997 equity funding provided by
TCK, certain technical subcontract revenues from K-Fuel LLC, and the Company's
interest in profits and production royalties from the KFP Project.
Additionally, any equity participation that the Company negotiates for future
commercial-scale production facilities prior to January 2000 (or later,
depending on whether TCK exercises Warrant "A") will have to be financed by
sources other than the Stock Purchase Agreement with TCK.   See "ITEM 1 -
BUSINESS - Strategic Relationships - Thermo Ecotek Corporation."
                                     -------------------------  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year Ended December 31, 1996 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1995
- -------------------------------------------------------------

          The Company had a net loss before income tax benefits and
extraordinary item of approximately $5,629,000 in 1996 as compared to a loss of
approximately $8,796,000 in 1995.  The decreased loss of approximately
$3,167,000 is attributable to a revenue increase of approximately $1,388,000 in
1996 over 1995, and a decrease in expenses of approximately $1,779,000 in 1996
as compared to 1995.  In 1996, the Company had no debt extinguishment gains and
related income tax benefits, as compared to such gains in 1995 totaling
approximately $2,567,000.  Including such gains in 1995, overall net loss
decreased from approximately $6,229,000 in 1995 to approximately $5,629,000 in
1996.

          Revenues increased in 1996 because of the one-time joint venture fee
of $1,000,000, as well as approximately $360,000 in technical subcontract work
the Company performed for K-Fuel LLC beginning  in mid-1996.  As the K-Fuel LLC
joint venture commenced in 1996, there were no comparable figures


                                      14
<PAGE>
 
in 1995. The Company does not expect to receive any further fees related to K-
Fuel LLC until one or more Commercial Projects are constructed by K-Fuel LLC;
see "ITEM 1- BUSINESS - Strategic Relationships - Kennecott Energy and Coal
                                                  -------------------------
Company."  The Company will perform additional technical subcontract work for K-
- -------                                                                        
Fuel LLC in 1997, although the dollar amount of such work is not currently
determinable.  All of K-Fuel LLC's research and development costs, including any
technical subcontract work performed for K-Fuel LLC by the Company, are paid by
KAFI.

          Expenses decreased by approximately $1,779,000 in 1996 as compared to
1995. The components of the overall decrease (increase) in expenses in 1996 are
summarized as follows (all figures are approximate):
<TABLE>

                                                                        ----------
     Net decrease in expenses.......................................... $1,779,000
                                                                        ==========
</TABLE>

          Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by
approximately $813,000 in 1996 as compared to 1995 primarily as a result of (1)
an overall decrease in professional services fees in 1996 of approximately
$859,000 and (2) a decrease in board of director compensation expense in 1996 of
approximately $178,000, partially offset by (3) the Company's 51 percent equity
in the expenses of K-Fuel LLC (other than research and development and
amortization expenses) in 1996 totaling approximately $87,000 and (4) an overall
increase in payroll and general administrative expenses in 1996 totaling
approximately $137,000.

          The decrease in professional services fees in 1996 is generally
attributable to certain stock-based compensation agreements incurred only in
1995 relating to certain marketing and public relations activities.  However,
legal fees increased by approximately $177,000 in 1996 to a total of
approximately $693,000, of which approximately $340,000 was specifically
attributable to the K-Fuel LLC joint venture agreement in 1996 and for which no
further significant legal expense is expected in 1997.  The decrease in board of
director compensation in 1996 is attributable to a change of compensation policy
beginning in 1996.   The Company's 51 percent equity in the marketing, general
and administrative expenses of K-Fuel LLC will continue in 1997 but will
increase over the 1996 amount because of the full year in 1997 as compared to
the partial year in 1996.   The increase in payroll and general and
administrative expenses in 1996 is attributable to the hiring of two executive
employees in 1996 and the Company doubling its Denver, Colorado headquarters
office space in the fourth quarter 1995.
                                                                               
          The litigation settlement ($800,000) and success fees relating to the
closing of the KFP Project ($960,000) were one-time expenses incurred in 1995
only.

          The decrease in interest expense in 1996 is attributable to the
significant decrease in outstanding debt in 1996 as compared to 1995.  Total
debt outstanding has decreased to $1,225,000 at December 31, 1996 from
approximately $1,614,000 at December 31, 1995, and from approximately $4,835,000
at December 31, 1994.

          The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 1996 is
attributable to the full year of amortization of the Series "C" patents acquired
in the third quarter of 1995 and the depreciation of certain property and
equipment additions in 1996 at the Company's demonstration and laboratory
facility.

                                      15
<PAGE>
 
          The increase in research and development and laboratory operating
expenses in 1996 is attributable to the K-Fuel LLC technical subcontract
services performed in 1996 only.  The Company will continue to perform such
services for K-Fuel LLC in 1997, although the amount and scope of such work is
not currently determinable.

          The write-down of mine property and reclamation costs incurred in 1996
are attributable to the Company's mining property near Gillette, Wyoming.  This
property was acquired by the Company in 1995 and was related to its
participation in the KFP Project.  The Company had intended to sell this
property. However, in 1996 the Company determined that it would not sell the
property; rather it intends to hold the mining property as a reserve coal supply
for the KFP Project to protect against any raw coal feedstock disruptions that
might result from the current consolidation that is happening among coal
producers in the Powder River Basin   Also in 1996, the Company reassessed the
value of this asset and wrote-down the value of  the property to its current
estimated value.  Additionally, the Company increased its reclamation reserve
related to the property by approximately $134,000 in 1996 because of more
accurate reclamation studies performed in 1996 and certain regulatory changes
enacted by the State of Wyoming.  The Company does not expect to incur any
significant cash reclamation costs related to the property in 1997.

Year Ended December 31, 1995 vs. Year Ended December 31, 1994
- -------------------------------------------------------------

          The Company had a net loss before income tax benefits and
extraordinary item of approximately $8,796,000 in 1995 as compared to a net loss
of approximately $6,120,000 in 1994.  The increased loss of approximately
$2,676,000 is primarily attributable to increased marketing, general and
administrative expenses of approximately $734,000, performance fees of $960,000
specifically associated with the TCK Stock Purchase Agreement and KFP Project
funding by TCK, and a litigation charge of $800,000.  The increased marketing,
general and administrative expenses in 1995 were primarily comprised of an
increase in legal and other professional fees of approximately $324,000
resulting from the TCK Stock Purchase Agreement and KFP Project construction
start-up, approximately $238,000 in increased investor and public relations
expenses, and other expense increases totaling approximately $172,000 primarily
relating to additional employees hired in 1995.

          Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by approximately
$251,000 in 1995 because of a full year of amortization of a prepaid consulting
agreement in 1995 as compared to a partial year in 1994, and the acquisition of
the Series "C" patents in August 1995.

          Research and development expenses  decreased by approximately $298,000
in 1995 because of specific activities and projects undertaken in 1994 only.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          Working capital decreased from approximately $2,254,000 at December
31, 1995 to a working capital deficit of approximately $167,000 at December 31,
1996.  The decrease is primarily attributable to a December 1995 investment by
TCK under the Stock Purchase Agreement for $3 million.  In January 1997, TCK
invested another $2.5 million in the Company.  On a proforma basis, after
including the January 1997 investment in the Company by TCK, proforma working
capital at December 31, 1996 was approximately $2,333,000, comparable to the
working capital at December 31, 1995.

                                      16
<PAGE>
 
          The Company expects no additional stock purchases by TCK in 1997, 1998
or 1999.  Under the terms of the TCK Stock Purchase Agreement, the next possible
investment by TCK is not until a period of time beginning in January 2000 and
expiring in July 2001.  There are no assurances that TCK will make any
investments in the Company at that time.  Additionally, the TCK Stock Purchase
Agreement prohibits the Company from issuing additional shares of common stock
to other investors unless at least 90 percent of the proceeds from such stock
issuances are used to invest in K-Fuel production facilities.  Furthermore, in
the event of any stock issuances by the Company, TCK's Warrant "A" may be
subject to certain adjustments that increase the number of shares available to
TCK under Warrant "A."  See "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - Strategic Relationships --
Thermo Ecotek Corporation."
- -------------------------  

          Because of the Company's current net operating loss carryforward
position with respect to federal income taxes, the Section 29 credit the Company
receives from its 5 percent ownership of KFP will likely not be utilized in the
near term (i.e., next two to three years).  Accordingly, the Company is
currently considering the sale of a portion of its ownership interest in KFP as
a means to generate cash.  There are no assurances that the Company will be able
to successfully complete such a sale transaction.

          KFP is also currently considering the construction of a fifth
processing vessel for the KFP Project, which would add production capacity of
approximately 125,000 TPY.  The funding for this expansion, if commenced, would
be funded 100 percent by TCK or other entities with which TCK and the Company
are currently negotiating.  The Company may be entitled to certain license fees
and an ownership percentage in the fifth processor expansion, the terms of which
have not yet been finalized.  There are no assurances that such an expansion
will be completed by KFP.

          The Company is also working to commence construction of the KFP II
Project. There are no assurances that the Company will obtain the necessary
permits for the KFP II Project or that suitable financing terms will be
negotiated with potential partners.  If the KFP II Project is not constructed,
it is unlikely that any other U.S. K-Fuel production facilities will be
constructed until K-Fuel LLC successfully develops an enhanced processing vessel
design and completes the remaining objectives of the research and development
program.  There are no assurances that such objectives of K-Fuel LLC will be
achieved.

          The Company's current cash balances, the expected revenues to be
derived from the Company's research and development subcontract agreements with
K-Fuel LLC, and the royalty income to be derived from the commencement of
operations of KFP in 1997 are expected to fund the Company's operations and debt
service requirements until the first quarter of 1998 based on current operating
plans and budgets.  The Company does not expect to realize any significant net
revenues from its 5 percent ownership interest in KFP during 1997.  The Company
will need to realize additional operating funding sources and reduce certain
operating expenses to sustain operations into 1998 and beyond.  Such potential
sources of funding may include, but are not limited to (1) the proposed sale of
all or a portion of the Company's 5 percent interest in KFP;  (2) certain
development and license fees that may be derived from a potential 125,000 TPY
expansion of the KFP Project; (3) license fees to be derived from the proposed
construction of an Indonesia K-Fuel production facility in late 1997 or early
1998; and (4) certain development and license fees to be derived from the
proposed commencement of construction of the 635,000 TPY KFP II Project.  There
are no assurances that any of these potential funding sources will materialize,
and the Company does not currently have any commitments with respect to any such
funding sources.  If such events do not materialize, the Company may be forced
to seek debt and / or equity financing on terms and conditions that may not be
favorable to the Company, if available at all.  The Company does not currently
have any commitments with respect to any debt or equity financing.

          As discussed at "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS - Current Projects - KFX Fuel
                                                                  --------

heating systems for the KFP facility.  Until the fire damage is fully repaired
and the KFP facility is operating at its full capacity, the Company may
experience  difficulty in attracting other investors to the KFP II Project, the
expansion of the KFP Project, or negotiating suitable terms with investors with
respect to the sale of all or a portion of the Company's ownership interest in
KFP.  The Company expects that the fire damage will be fully repaired and the
KFP facility will be fully operational in the second or third quarter of 1997.
The Company also anticipates that it will be required to fund a capital call in
the second quarter of 1997 relating to certain cost overruns on the construction
of the KFP project.  The amount of the capital call is expected to be
approximately $410,000, reduced by a receivable the Company has from KFP in the
amount of approximately $260,000.  The net amount of the capital call, or
approximately $150,000, will be funded by the Company from available cash or a
short-term promissory note with KFP.  This capital call does not include any
uninsured losses resulting from the December 1996 fire.  Presently, the Company
does not expect that KFP will have any significant uninsured losses.  There are
no assurances that additional capital calls will not be required to be funded by
the Company in 1997.

To the Board of Directors and
          Stockholders of KFX Inc:


          In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
KFX Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KFX Inc.
("KFX" or the "Company"), its wholly-owned subsidiary, KFX Wyoming, Inc.
("KFXW"), and its majority-owned subsidiaries, KFX Technology, Inc. ("KFXT",
formerly Energy Brothers Technology, Inc.), Atlantic Partners, Ltd. ("APL"), and
Heartland Fuels Corporation ("HFC").  The Company's 67 percent interest in KSA
Partnership ("KSA"), its 51 percent interest in K-Fuel, L.L.C. ("K-Fuel"), and
its 5 percent interest in KFX Fuel Partners, L.P. ("KFP") are accounted for as
equity investments as the Company does not have the authority or ability to
independently control or manage these entities. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

          The Company holds patents to the K-Fuel Technology which enhances the
combustion characteristics of coal and other carbonaceous fuels.  The Company
intends to generate revenue by licensing the K-Fuel Technology to third party
operators or by the direct ownership and management of K-Fuel production
facilities.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

          The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  At December
31, 1996, cash and cash equivalents included money market and mutual fund
accounts of $1,317,420.  Such amounts are carried at cost which at December 31,
1996 approximates fair market value.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

          Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost.  Expenditures that
extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.  Repairs and maintenance that
do not extend the useful lives of the assets are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives:

                   Plant, machinery and equipment    7-15 years
                   Office furniture and equipment    3-5  years

PATENTS

          The Company holds patents to the Series "A", "B" and "C"  K-Fuel
Technology.  The costs of obtaining new patents are capitalized; costs of
defending and maintaining patents are expensed as incurred.  Patents are
amortized over the lives of the respective patents of 17 to 20  years for
domestic patents and 5 to 20 years for foreign patents.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

          Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)


INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

          The computation of net income (loss) per share is based upon the
weighted average shares of common stock and common stock equivalents (dilutive
stock options and warrants and convertible securities) outstanding during the
period.  Proceeds from the assumed exercise of the dilutive stock options and
warrants are assumed to be used to repurchase outstanding shares of the
Company's common stock at the average fair market value during the period.  Net
loss per common share before income taxes and extraordinary items excludes
common equivalent shares as the effect would be anti-dilutive.

ESTIMATES

          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods
presented.  Significant estimates have been made by management with respect to
the realizability of the Company's property, plant and equipment, patents,
investment in KFP, prepaid royalty, mine reclamation liability, and the possible
outcome of outstanding litigation.  Actual results could differ from these
estimates, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in
the near term.  See Notes 2, 3, 4, 7, 11 and 14 for additional information with
respect to these estimates.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

          Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1995 and 1994
financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

FUTURE SOURCES OF FUNDS

          The Company's current cash balances, the expected revenues to be
derived from the Company's research and development subcontract agreements with
K-Fuel LLC, and the royalty income to be derived from the commencement of
operations of KFP in 1997 are expected to fund the Company's operations and debt
service requirements until the first quarter of 1998 based on current operating
plans and budgets.  The Company does not expect to realize any significant net
revenues from its 5 percent ownership interest in KFP during 1997.  The Company
will need to realize additional operating funding sources and reduce certain
operating expenses to sustain operations into 1998 and beyond.  Such potential
sources of funding may include, but are not limited to (1) the proposed sale of
all or a portion of the Company's 5 percent interest in KFP;  (2) certain
development and license fees that may be derived from a potential expansion of
the existing KFP production facility; (3) license fees to be derived from a
proposed Indonesia K-Fuel production facility in late 1997 or early 1998; and
(4) certain development and license fees to be derived from the proposed
commencement of construction of an additional K-Fuel production facility near
Gillette, Wyoming.  There are no assurances that any of these potential funding
sources will materialize, and the Company does not currently have any
commitments with respect to any such funding sources.  If such events do not
materialize, the Company may be forced to seek debt and/or equity financing on
terms and conditions that may not be favorable to the Company, if available at
all.  The Company does not currently have any commitments with respect to any
debt or equity financing.

</TABLE>

          Depreciation expense was $837,945 and $798,141 in 1996 and 1995,
respectively.  In August 1995, the Company contributed laboratory equipment,
buildings and other equipment with a net book value of $410,645 to KFP.  See
Note 4.

          In order to facilitate the development of the production facility
discussed in Note 4, in August 1995 the Company acquired certain coal mining and
surface properties near Gillette, Wyoming from Fort Union, Ltd. ("Fort Union").
Such properties include approximately 1.3 million tons of coal reserves which
will be depleted using the units of production method, if and when mined.  The
consideration paid for the properties is in the form of a royalty share
agreement whereby the Company is required to pay Fort Union an amount equal to
20 percent of the royalty income received by the Company from all North American
applications of the K-Fuel process until the earlier of such time as (1) Fort
Union has received royalty share payments in the amount of $1,500,000, or (2)
September 15, 2015.  Additionally, the Company was required to assume Fort
Union's reclamation liabilities related to the acquired properties.  As a
result, the Company was required to deposit $1,503,032 into an escrow account to
ensure the performance of the reclamation obligations until such time as Fort
Union has been fully and finally released from all liability for the reclamation
obligations.  In November 1995, the Company and KFP submitted a joint permit
application to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Land Quality
Division ("DEQ") that was approved in April 1996 and resulted in (1) the
transfer all of Fort Union's reclamation obligations with respect to the
acquired properties to the Company and KFP, and (2) the return of the escrow
reclamation deposit to the Company.

          The mine reclamation liability of $1,166,000 at December 31, 1996
represents the estimated cost to the Company to reclaim the property in
compliance with minimum standards established by the State of Wyoming and
various governmental agencies.  In connection with obtaining a permit to conduct
mining and reclamation operations, the Company has entered into a bond agreement
to ensure payment of reclamation costs.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)


          When acquired, it was the Company's intent to sell this coal mining
property.  However, in 1996 the Company determined that it would not sell it;
rather, it would be retained for purposes of a reserve supply of coal to be used
in the KFP production facility if ever needed.  In 1996, the Company also
reassessed the value of this asset in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," and wrote down its
investment in mining property to an estimated fair market value of $465,500.
The charge of $566,512 is reflected in the results of operations of the Company

  Patents amortization expense, including abandoned patents, was $646,607 and
$568,600 in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  The Series "C" patents were acquired
in August 1995 by the payment of $1,000,000 cash and the issuance of a $335,134
promissory note that was paid in 1996.

NOTE 4.  INVESTMENT IN KFX FUEL PARTNERS, L.P.

  In August 1995, the Company acquired a 5 percent general and limited
partnership interest in KFX Fuel Partners, L.P. ("KFP").  The remaining 95
percent general and limited partnership interest in KFP is held by Thermo Ecotek
Corporation ("TCK").   In September 1995, KFP began construction of a 500,000
tons-per-year K-Fuel production facility near Gillette, Wyoming.  At December
31, 1996, total construction costs of the facility were approximately $45
million, and were funded entirely by TCK.  As part of its investment in 1995,
the Company contributed to KFP certain assets from its demonstration facility
near Gillette, Wyoming with a book value of approximately $411,000, and certain
permitting and engineering costs incurred by the Company totaling approximately
$620,000.  Additionally, as a condition of acquiring the 5 percent interest in
KFP, in August 1995 the Company  acquired an additional 80 percent interest in
Heartland Fuels Corporation ("HFC") in exchange for 375,000 shares of the
Company's common stock valued at $1,875,000, a cash payment of  $100,000, and a
promissory note of $150,000 due in February 1996.  HFC's only asset is a license
to the Company's Series "A" and "B" K-Fuel technology.  Prior to the HFC
transaction, the Company held a 5 percent interest in HFC and was indebted to
HFC in the amount of approximately $364,000.  The total consideration paid for
the HFC interest, less the indebtedness of the Company to HFC, was also recorded
as part of the Company's investment in KFP.

  In addition to its 5 percent interest in KFP, the Company will receive a
royalty of 3 percent of the net sales of the KFP facility.

          On December 24, 1996, a fire destroyed one of two oil heating systems
that provide the main processing structure (comprised of four processing
vessels) with heat transfer fluid.  It is estimated that KFP's insurance will
cover substantially all of the costs of replacing the destroyed equipment.
Commercial operations of the KFP facility (i.e., shipment of fuel product to
purchasers or stockpiling of product on the KFP site) are expected to begin in
the second quarter of 1997 for the two processing vessels unaffected by the
fire, and in the second half of 1997 for the other two processing vessels that
were affected by the fire damage to the oil heating system.  Total production of
the KFP facility is expected to reach its full output of 500,000 TPY beginning
in 1998.  As of December 31, 1996, TCK was committed to fund approximately $5
million to complete construction and start-up of the KFP facility.

          As of December 31, 1996, KFP had construction in progress of
approximately $44,736,000 and current liabilities of approximately $1,893,000.
For the year ended December 31, 1996, KFP generated no revenues and had no net
income.  This was a result of all of KFP's efforts being directed towards
construction of the facility discussed above.

NOTE 5.  THERMO ECOTEK CORPORATION STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  In August 1995, the Company and Thermo Ecotek Corporation ("TCK") entered into
a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") whereby TCK acquired
1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock for $3 million, and the right to
purchase up to an additional 2,750,000 shares of the Company's common stock at
the same price per share.  In December 1995, TCK purchased an additional
1,500,000 shares for  $3 million.  Additionally, TCK purchased the remaining
1,250,000 shares of common stock in January 1997 for $2.5 million, increasing
its ownership in the Company from approximately 14 percent  to approximately 18
percent.

          In addition, as part of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company
issued two common stock purchase warrants to TCK.  The first warrant ("Warrant
A") is for 7,750,000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price
of $3.65 per share (subject to certain adjustments), and is exercisable, in
whole or in part, commencing on January 1, 2000 and expiring on July 31, 2001.
The second warrant ("Warrant B") gives TCK the right to purchase the number of
shares of common stock that, when added to the shares owned by TCK on the
exercise date or which TCK has the right to acquire 60 days after the exercise
date, would be sufficient to give TCK ownership of 51 percent of the outstanding
shares of common stock of the Company, on a fully diluted basis, on the exercise
date.   Warrant B is  exercisable, in  whole  or in part, commencing  on
January 1, 2000 and expiring on July 31, 2001, provided, however, that  Warrant
B may not be exercised unless TCK has fully exercised Warrant A.  The exercise
price of  Warrant B will be the average daily closing price of the common stock
for the 40 trading days immediately preceding the exercise date.

NOTE 6.  INVESTMENT IN K-FUEL, L.L.C.

          In April 1996, the Company and Kennecott Alternative Fuels, Inc.
("KAFI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kennecott Energy and Coal Company
("KECC"), formed K-Fuel, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("K-Fuel
LLC"). Pursuant to the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the "Agreement"), K-
Fuel LLC will be the vehicle for further technical advancement and the
commercialization of business opportunities arising out of the K-Fuel
Technology, including research and development, sublicensing, marketing and
consulting, but not including any actual construction of plants or facilities to
produce K-Fuel products on a commercial basis ("Commercial Projects").
Commercial Projects will be constructed by separate entities in which KAFI, the
Company or both will have an equity interest and which will receive a sublicense
from K-Fuel LLC for the K-Fuel Technology.

          Initially, the Company has a 51 percent interest in K-Fuel LLC and
KAFI has a 49 percent interest, except to the extent of certain research and
development and amortization expenses, which by written agreement are allocated
100 percent to KAFI. At such time as entities in which KAFI has an equity
interest have placed into service Commercial Projects with a collective design
capacity equal to or in excess of 3 million tons of K-Fuel product per annum,
KAFI will have a 51 percent interest in K-Fuel LLC and the Company will have a
49 percent interest.  A fee of $1,000,000 was paid to the Company in
consideration for the Company entering into the Agreement, and has been recorded
by the Company as joint venture fee revenue in 1996.  Subject to certain
conditions, KAFI has also agreed to make additional capital contributions to K-
Fuel LLC in such amounts as may be necessary for all research and development
costs incurred by K-Fuel LLC, up to $4,000,000.  During 1996, KAFI funded such
research and development costs totaling approximately $1,440,000.  Additionally,
in 1996 the Company and KAFI contributed to K-Fuel LLC approximately $386,000
and $371,000, respectively, for certain administrative, marketing and project
development activities in the United States and Indonesia.  As of December 31,
1996, K-Fuel LLC was not committed to fund or construct any Commercial Projects.

          The activities and financial results of K-Fuel LLC are accounted for
by the Company using the equity method, rather than consolidated, as the Company
does not have the authority to independently control K-Fuel LLC.  The Company's
investment in K-Fuel LLC at December 31, 1996 was approximately $157,000.

          In connection with the Agreement, the Company granted K-Fuel LLC an
exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, royalty-free right and license (including the
right to grant sublicenses) to and under the K-Fuel Technology, except to the
extent that it pertains to the beneficiation or restructuring of coal or coal
related feedstocks covered under the HFC License (as defined below)  (the "KFX
License"). In addition, Heartland Fuels Corporation, an 85 percent owned
subsidiary of the Company, granted K-Fuel LLC an exclusive, worldwide, fully-
paid, royalty-free right and license (including the right to grant sublicenses)
to and under the Series "A" and Series "B" K-Fuel Technology, as it pertains to
the beneficiation or restructuring of coal or coal related feedstocks (the "HFC
License"). Both the KFX License and the HFC License specify minimum terms and
provisions for any sublicenses granted by K-Fuel LLC to third parties.

NOTE 7.  PREPAID ROYALTY

  In June 1996, the Company entered into a royalty amendment agreement with
Edward Koppelman, the inventor of the K-Fuel Technology.  Prior to the
agreement, Mr. Koppelman was entitled to a royalty of 2 percent on the gross
sales value of K-Fuel product produced by any entity, including any product
produced by the Company.  As a result of the agreement, Mr. Koppelman's royalty
is now 25 percent of the Company's worldwide royalty and license fee revenue,
computed after the State of Wyoming royalty as discussed at Note 13.  The
royalty to Mr. Koppelman will cease when the cumulative payments to him reach
the sum of approximately $75,222,000.

  As consideration for the royalty amendment agreement, the Company paid Mr.
Koppelman $300,000 cash and issued a promissory note in the amount of $200,000,
due in June 1998.  A $25,000 payment was made on the promissory note in 1996.
See Note 9.  The $500,000 prepaid royalty will be amortized based on the
difference between what royalty payments to Mr. Koppelman would have been on the
original royalty agreement and the amended royalty agreement reached in 1996.

NOTE 11.  STOCK OPTION PLANS

          The Company has two employee stock option plans - the Amended and
Restated Stock Option Plan (the "1992 Plan"), and the 1996 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan (the "1996 Plan").

  The 1992 Plan provides for the award to executive officers (including officers
who are also directors), non-employee directors and other key employees of the
Company of either non-qualified stock options ("NSO") or incentive stock options
("ISO"), as defined in Section 422 of the United States Internal Revenue Code.
Stock options, either NSO or ISO, granted under the 1992 Plan vest 20 percent on
the date of grant, with an additional 20 percent vesting on each anniversary
date of the grant until fully vested, unless other terms of vesting are
specified by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the
"Committee").  Additionally, the Committee can accelerate the vesting of an
outstanding option at its sole discretion, and is required to accelerate the
vesting of all outstanding options outstanding under the 1992 Plan in the event
of a change in control of the Company, which is defined as (1) when any person
(as such term is defined in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934) becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the total number of
shares of common stock then outstanding; (2) the Board of Directors or
shareholders approve the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or any merger with or into the Company; or (3) the Company declares a
cash dividend in an amount in excess of 10 percent of the then fair market value
of the outstanding shares of common stock.  All stock options granted under the
1992 Plan expire ten years from the date of grant.  The Company has reserved
1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1992 Plan.

          The 1996 Plan provides for the award to executive officers, non-
employee directors and other key employees of the Company of only non-qualified
stock options.  Stock options granted under the 1996 Plan vest 20 percent on the
first anniversary date of the grant, and an additional 20 percent each
anniversary date thereafter until fully vested.  The Committee has similar
authority to accelerate the vesting of any outstanding option as with the 1992

common stock on the date of grant.

          As a result of TCK's purchase of the Company's common stock in January
1997, all non-vested stock options under the 1992 Plan became fully vested as

  In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation."  This new standard defines a fair value approach of accounting
for employee stock options or similar equity instruments.  As permitted under
SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue measuring compensation expense
under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") No. 25, which uses an intrinsic value
approach to measuring compensation expense, i.e., compensation expense is
generally recognized only when the exercise price of an employee stock option or
similar equity instrument is below the fair market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant.  The following table summaries the pro forma
effects on net loss for the two most recent fiscal years as if the Company had
elected to implement SFAS No. 123:

NOTE 13.  STATE OF WYOMING DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT

  In February 1994, the Company reached an agreement with the State of Wyoming
("State") to restructure the bond and accrued interest obligations of KFXT,
formerly Energy Brothers Technology, Inc.  The State agreed to take ownership of
the Company's guaranteed investment contracts and cancel all but $650,000 of the
bond principal and accrued interest obligations.  In exchange, the Company
agreed to convey to the State a 12 percent ownership interest in the Company's
K-Fuel technology patents.  When the cumulative revenue to the State, from
license fees and royalty payments, reaches $5 million, the State's interest will
decrease to 6 percent.  The State will retain the remaining 6 percent interest
thereafter, unless reacquired by the Company in an arm's length negotiation.

          The remaining $650,000 note to the State carries annual interest at
6.5 percent and is due on February 28, 1998.  As part of the agreement with the
State, Energy Brothers Holding, Inc., an affiliate of the Company, and an
officer and director of the Company executed a promissory note to the State in
the amount of $819,000, with annual interest at 6 percent.  This amount will be
deemed to be paid when the revenue to the State from the Company's patent rights
conveyance reaches $3 million.  The Company has agreed to indemnify the officer
and director to the extent that payments are made to the State under the
agreement. In 1995, the Company paid the State approximately $50,300 that
related to the interest due under the officer and director's promissory note.

          As a result of the above debt extinguishment transaction, the Company
recognized a gross extraordinary gain of $8,468,803 in 1994.  The components of
the gain are as follows:

          In December 1996, the Company formed KFX Fuel Partners II, L.P. ("KFP
II"), a Delaware limited partnership, related to a proposed K-Fuel production
plant in Gillette, Wyoming adjacent to the existing production facility as
discussed at Note 4.  The Company currently holds 100 percent of the general and
limited partner interests of KFP II, which as of December 31, 1996 had no assets
or liabilities.
 
          Pursuant to a Pledge Agreement dated April 19, 1996 between an officer
and director of the Company and KECC, the same officer and director pledged to
KECC 500,000 shares of his ownership of the Company's common stock in the event
KECC suffers any loss related to possible losses from the purchase and sale of
product pursuant to a fuel purchase option between KECC and KFP dated April 19,
1996.

          The Company is contingently liable to Ohio Valley Electric Corporation
("OVEC") for an overriding royalty of 0.5 percent to OVEC on the gross revenues
generated by the sale of fuel produced from any production plant (other than the
current facility being constructed by KFP) located in the United States in which
the feedstock is coal and which uses the Company's proprietary Series "C" K-Fuel
technology to produce fuel.  See Note 4.

          The Company is contingently liable to Fort Union for 20 percent of the
Company's North American royalty proceeds.  This obligation expires upon the
earlier of (1) the cumulative payment to Fort Union of $1.5 million, or (2)
September 15, 2015.

          Pursuant to an Indemnity Agreement dated August 18, 1995 between the
Company and TCK, the parties agreed, among other things, that (i) neither party,
nor any affiliate thereof may build, construct or operate, or have any interest
in a plant or facility, except as contemplated by the OVEC Fuel Option Agreement
and the I&M Fuel Option Agreement that would compete, directly or indirectly,
with the Project until the earlier of (a) five years after the date the KFP
Project commences commercial operation, (b) the date on which KFP has entered
into contracts for the sale of a minimum of 70 percent of the output of the KFP
Project for a term of at least five years, and  (c)  the date on which the
combined KFP interests of the Company and TCK total less than 50.1 percent;
provided, however, that such limitation shall not apply to the operations or
activities of the parties with respect to international (excluding Canada and
Mexico) business ventures and activities; and (ii) the Company shall guarantee
any loan created pursuant to the Partnership Agreement relating to a capital
call for the license to mine coal.   An officer and director of the Company has
pledged 225,000 shares of his ownership of the Company's common stock to
guarantee any obligations of the Company arising from the Indemnity Agreement.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)


          In November 1995, the Company filed a lawsuit against Fru-Con
Construction Corporation and Fru-Con Engineering, Inc. (collectively, "Fru-Con")
in the Wyoming State Court, 6th Judicial District.  The action has been removed
to the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming.  The Company's
lawsuit requests that the court enter a judgment that Fru-Con has no interest or
claim in or against the Company or any of the Company's property or interests,
or that Fru-Con is barred from such claims.  Fru-Con had asserted claims for
approximately $1.8 million for engineering services and an interest in K-Fuel
plants built in North America by virtue of contractual arrangements with a
limited partnership sponsored by corporations in which a predecessor entity to
the Company had a partnership  interest.  Because the work  done  by Fru-Con was
for a limited  partnership  in which  the  Company's predecessor entity was not
a partner, and because payment for the work performed by Fru-Con was contingent
upon successful project financing which never materialized, as well as for other
legal and factual reasons, the Company believes that Fru-Con has no valid rights
or claims against the Company.  Accordingly, the Company believes that the
ultimate resolution of this action will not have a material adverse impact on
the Company's financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 15.  INCOME TAXES

          All of the Company's operations are currently domestic, with income
taxable at the federal statutory rate of 34 percent.  The tax benefit recorded
in 1995 and 1994 of $872,851 and $2,879,393, respectively, related to the
utilization of current year losses to offset taxes on the extraordinary gains
from debt extinguishment.  Deferred tax assets (liabilities) were comprised of
the following:

</TABLE>

          No net deferred tax asset has been recorded for loss carryforwards or
other deferred tax assets because it is currently more likely than not that such
benefits will no be realized.  The change in the valuation allowance for the
current year reflects the changes in the above items.  The Company's loss
carryforwards of approximately 18,296,000 expires in various amounts through
2011.

NOTE 16.    ATLANTIC PARTNERS, LTD.

          In 1994, the Company acquired an additional 49 percent interest in
APL, increasing its total interest to 83 percent.  Accordingly, APL's results of
operations from the acquisition date have been consolidated in these financial
statements.  Prior to the acquisition, the Company's 34 percent interest in APL
was accounted for under the equity method.  APL had no net assets on the
acquisition date.  Accordingly, no value was assigned by the Company to this
additional interest.  The pro forma impact of the acquisition on the Company's
financial position and results of operations was not significant. See Note 10.

                         CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1       CONTRACTOR'S SERVICES

2.1.1     The Contractor shall be responsible for furnishing the Design,
including the Drawings and Specifications, and construction of the Project.  The
Contractor and Owner have developed a Project Schedule, attached hereto and
incorporated by reference as Exhibit B, and the Owner shall be responsible for
prompt decisions and approvals so as to maintain the Project Schedule.  Any
design, engineering, architectural, other professional service, or construction
service required to be performed under this Agreement shall be performed by duly
licensed personnel or entities.

2.1.2     Contractor's services hereunder shall consist of three phases.  PHASE
1-Development Engineering:  The Contractor shall prepare Design Development
documents to fix the cost, size and character of the Project as to structural,
mechanical and electrical systems, materials and other appropriate essential
items in the Project.  These Development Documents are the basis for the design
and construction of the Project.  PHASE 2-Detailed Engineering:  From approved
Design Development Documents, the Contractor shall prepare working Drawings and
Specifications setting forth in detail the requirements and cost for the
construction of the Project, and based upon codes, laws or regulations in effect
at the time of their preparation.  PHASE 3-Construction: The Contractor shall
engineer, procure and construct the Project pursuant to approved Drawings and
Specifications.  

                                     - 8 -
<PAGE>
 
Contractor shall proceed with each phase only upon receipt from Owner of a
written notice to proceed.

2.1.3     The Contractor and the Owner will work closely together to monitor the
design in accordance with prior approvals so as to ensure that the Project can
be constructed within the Guaranteed Maximum as defined in Article 6.  As these
working Drawings and Specifications are being completed, the Contractor will
keep the Owner advised of the effects of any Owner requested changes on the
Project Schedule and/or the Guaranteed Maximum.  Construction of the Project
shall be in accordance with these Drawings and Specifications as approved by the
Owner.  The Drawings and Specifications are the property of the Owner and are
not to be used by the Contractor on this or other projects without the written
consent of the Owner.

2.1.4     After the completion of each of Phase 1 and 2 as set forth in Article
2.1.2, if the Project is no longer feasible from the standpoint of the Owner,
the Owner may terminate this Agreement and pay the Contractor pursuant to
Article 6 through the date of termination.  The Project is no longer feasible
only if, in the exercise of Owner's prudent business judgment, Owner determines
that: (i) the Permits, Licenses and Governmental Approvals, attached hereto and
incorporated by reference as Exhibit E, necessary to construct the Project will
not be timely granted so as to achieve Start-up by April 1, 1998 and/or
Commercial Operation by June 1, 1998; or (ii) adequate commitments for equity
and/or debt financing have not been received by April 1, 1997.  Owner shall
immediately notify Contractor of termination pursuant to this Article 2.1.4.
Contractor shall not commence work on the next succeeding phase except upon
receipt of a Notice to Proceed from Owner.

2.1.5     The Contractor and the Owner will assist the other in securing
authorizations necessary for the construction of the Project.  Exhibit E is a
preliminary list, and Owner and Contractor will diligently identify and apply
for all applicable permits, licenses and government approvals.  Permits,
Licenses and Government Approvals, Exhibit E, identifies the party responsible
for timely acquiring the same in the column labeled  "Responsible Party":
Contractor is identified as "Yanke" and Owner is identified as "KFP."

2.2       RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO CONSTRUCTION

which have been legally enacted at the time of execution of this Agreement and
for which the Contractor is liable.

2.2.3     The Project Schedule, attached hereto and incorporated by reference as
Exhibit B, indicates the dates for the starting and completion of the various
stages of the design and construction.  With the Owner's consent, it shall be
revised as required by the conditions of the Work and those conditions and
events which are beyond the Contractor's control; provided, however, that in no
event may the dates for Start-up or Commercial Operation be moved to a later
date.

2.2.4     The Contractor shall at all times keep the premises free from the
accumulation of waste materials or rubbish caused by his operations.  At the
completion of the Work, he shall remove all of his waste material and rubbish
from and around the Project as well as all his tools, construction equipment,

shall comply with all applicable provisions of federal, state and municipal
safety laws to prevent accidents or injury to persons on, about or adjacent to
the Project site.  He shall erect and properly maintain, at all times, as
required by the conditions and progress of Work, necessary safeguards for the
protection of workmen and the public. It is understood and agreed, however, that
the Contractor shall have no responsibility for the elimination or abatement of
safety hazards created or otherwise resulting from Work at the job site carried
on by other persons or firms directly employed by the Owner as separate
contractors, and the Owner agrees to cause any such separate contractors to
abide by and fully adhere to all applicable provisions of federal, state and
municipal safety laws and regulations and to comply with all reasonable
requests and directions of the Contractor for the elimination or abatement of
any such safety hazards at the job site.

2.2.7     The Contractor shall keep such full and detailed accounts as may be
necessary for proper financial management under this Agreement.  The system
shall be satisfactory to the Owner, who shall be afforded access to all the
Contractor's records, books, correspondence, instructions, drawings, receipts,
vouchers, memoranda and similar data relating to this Agreement.  The Contractor
shall preserve all such records for a period of three years after the final

                             CHANGES IN THE PROJECT

7.1    The Owner, without invalidating this Agreement, may order Changes in
the Project within the general scope of this Agreement consisting of additions,
deletions or other revisions.  Owner and  Contractor specifically acknowledge
that design and operating experience with the Existing Facility are expected and
anticipated to result in Changes in the Project.  The Guaranteed Maximum shall
be adjusted accordingly.  All such Changes in the Project shall be authorized by
Change Order.

7.1.1  A Change Order is a written order to the Contractor signed by the Owner
or his authorized agent and issued after the execution of this Agreement,
authorizing a Change in the Project and/or an adjustment in the Guaranteed
Maximum or the Project Schedule.

7.1.2  In the event that Owner contemplates making a Change in the Project,
Owner shall advise Contractor of same and Owner and Contractor shall then
promptly consult (at Owner's expense) concerning the price and impact on the
Project Schedule of implementing the proposed change.  In the event Owner has
notified Contractor of a contemplated change in the Project, Contractor shall
use its reasonable efforts to perform the Project in a manner 

                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>
 
that does not materially alter the scope or cost of or have a potential effect
on the schedule resulting from, any contemplated change in the Project during
the period of consultation regarding, and preparation of estimates relating to,
such contemplated change. Following such consultation, Owner may request and
Contractor shall thereupon promptly and as soon as is reasonably practicable
prepare (at Owner's expense) a detailed written estimate relating to the
contemplated change, including (i) solely with respect to a change requiring a
modification to the Project, the price of such change, (ii) the effect such
change could be expected to have on the Project Schedule (including, but not
limited to, the Substantial Completion Date and Final Completion Date) or any
other schedule, and (iii) the potential effect of such change on Contractor's
ability to comply with any of its obligations hereunder. Owner shall review this
estimate with Contractor for the purpose of determining whether to proceed with
such change in the Project and, if so, for the purpose of agreeing on the
matters set forth therein, including a mutually acceptable adjustment to the
Guaranteed Maximum and/or the Project Schedule, if any, if the proposed change
requires a modification of the Project. If the parties reach agreement on the
matters listed in the estimate, Owner shall issue a Change Order which reflects
the nature of such agreement. Contractor shall promptly adjust (subject to
Owner's approval) any affected portion of the Estimated Drawdown Schedule,
attached hereto and incorporated by reference as Exhibit D, and any other
schedules requiring adjustment to reflect the change agreed upon. In no event
shall Contractor undertake or be obliged to undertake a change in the Project
until it has received a Change Order signed by Owner.

7.1.3  Except as otherwise set forth herein, no change in the Project or request
relating to a contemplated change in the  Project pursuant to this Article 7
shall affect the Substantial Completion Date or the Final Completion Date unless
specifically agreed to in writing by Owner.  In the event Owner and Contractor
fail to agree on the impact of a proposed change in the Project on the
Substantial Completion Date or Final Completion Date, Owner may nevertheless
require Contractor to make such change, subject to Contractor's right to dispute
the impact of such change on such deadlines.

7.1.4  Owner shall have the right, upon written notice to Contractor, to require
that the Project be accelerated by means of overtime, additional crews or
additional shifts or resequencing, of the Project notwithstanding that the
Project is progressing without delay in accordance with the established Project
Schedule.  Contractor agrees to use all reasonable efforts to perform such
acceleration, and Contractor shall be entitled to reimbursement of increased
cost (premium portion of overtime pay, additional crew, shift or equipment cost
and such other items of cost requested by Contractor and approved by Owner in
advance of any acceleration (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld).
Contractor 

                                     - 18 -
<PAGE>
 
shall promptly provide a plan for such acceleration, including his
recommendations for the most effective and economical acceleration.

7.1.5  If the Owner and the Contractor are unable to mutually agree on the
increase or decrease in the Guaranteed Maximum under 7.1.2 resulting from a
Change in the Project, the Contractor shall promptly proceed with the Work
required by the Change in the Project provided the Contractor receives a written
order to proceed signed by the Owner, and the change in the Guaranteed Maximum
shall be determined as follows:  the change in the Guaranteed Maximum shall then
be determined on the basis of the reasonable costs of such Work and savings of
those performing the Work attributed to the Changes in the Project including the
percentage fee due Contractor.  The amount of decrease in the Guaranteed Maximum
to be allowed by Contractor to the Owner for any deletion or Change in the
Project which results in a net decrease in cost will be the amount of the actual
net decrease only.  When both increases and decreases in costs of the Work are
involved in any one Change in the Project, the increase in the percentage fee
due Contractor shall be figured on the basis of the net increase in costs, if
any.  Under this Article 7, the Contractor shall keep and present, in such form
as the Owner may prescribe, an itemized accounting together with appropriate
supporting data of the effect on the Guaranteed Maximum.  The increase or
decrease in the Guaranteed Maximum under this Article 7 shall be authorized by
Change Order signed by the Owner or its authorized agent.

7.1.6  Should concealed conditions encountered in the performance of the Work
below the surface of the ground or should concealed  or unknown conditions in an
existing structure be at variance with the conditions indicated by the Drawings,
Specifications, or Owner-furnished information or should unknown physical
conditions below the surface of the ground or should concealed or unknown
conditions in an existing structure of an unusual nature, differing materially
from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in work
of the character provided for in this Agreement, be encountered, the Guaranteed
Maximum shall be equitably adjusted by Change Order upon claim by either party
made within a reasonable time after the first observance of the conditions.

7.2       MINOR CHANGES IN THE PROJECT

7.2.1     The Owner will have authority to order minor changes in the Project
not involving an adjustment in the Guaranteed Maximum or an extension of the
Project Schedule and not inconsistent with the intent of the Drawings and
Specifications.  Such changes may be effected by written order and shall be
binding on the Owner and the Contractor.

7.3.1     In any emergency affecting the safety of persons or property, the
Contractor shall act, at its discretion to prevent threatened damage, injury or
loss.  Any increase in the Guaranteed Maximum claimed by the Contractor on
account of emergency work shall be determined as provided in this Article.

                                   ARTICLE 8

                           PAYMENTS TO THE CONTRACTOR

8.1       Payments shall be made by the Owner to the Contractor according to the
following procedure:

8.1.1  On or before the tenth (10th) day of each month, Contractor shall submit
to Owner for its approval a Request for Payment.  Each Request for Payment shall
set forth (a) Work performed, (b) equipment purchased by the Contractor and
delivered to the Site, or stored during the previous month, (c) progress
payments to equipment vendors for off-site engineering and fabrication; and (d)
the percentage fee due Contractor.  Each such application shall be for an amount
equal to the total cost of the Work performed and equipment delivered to the
Site as of the date of such Request for Payment (or, in the case of such portion
of the Request for Payment related to progress payments to subcontractors, an
estimate of the total cost of the Work per formed and equipment delivered
relating to such progress payments), less all previous payments, and shall
include such supportive documentation as Owner may reasonably require.  Each
Request for Payment shall be accompanied by partial lien waivers  of the
Contractor, and for each subcontractor attributable to the Work covered by the
previous payment.

8.1.2  No progress payment, nor any partial or entire use of the Work by Owner,
shall constitute an acceptance of any Work.    Title to all equipment and
materials shall pass to Owner upon the date payment is made to Contractor
without regard to any retainage withheld by Owner; Contractor, however, shall
retain care, custody and control of the same and exercise due care with respect
thereto until the earlier of the Substantial Completion Date or the termination
of this Agreement.  Said transfer of title shall in no way affect Owner's rights
as set forth in other provisions of this Agreement.

8.1.3  In each Request for Payment, Contractor shall certify that such Request
for Payment represents the amount to which Contractor is entitled pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and shall also certify as follows:  There are no
known, or, to Contractor's knowledge, pending or threatened mechanics, or
materialmen's liens or other such claims or encumbrances outstanding at the date
of this Request for Payment (except as described below), all due and payable
bills with respect to the Work have been paid to date or are included in the
amount requested in the current application, and, except for such bills not
paid but so included, there is no 

                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>
 
known basis for the filing of any mechanics, or materialmen's liens on the
Project or the Work (except as described below) and releases from all
subcontractors have been obtained in such form as to constitute an effective
release of lien (corresponding to payments received by them) under the laws of
the State of Wyoming.

8.1.4  Contractor shall furnish with each Request for Payment a waiver and
release of liens and security interest to the extent of the payment received by
Contractor in respect of the immediately preceding Request for Payment in the
form of Exhibit G hereto for itself and, beginning with the second Request for
Payment, for each of its subcontractors together with any other such forms or
documents as required by Owner or Owner's title insurer in order to assure an
effective release of mechanics' or materialmen's liens and all other claims or
encumbrances, legal or equitable for such previous payments, or for any Work
performed under this Agreement, in compliance with the laws of the State of
Wyoming.

8.1.5  Contractor shall submit as part of each Request for Payment a monthly
progress report (a "Progress Report") in the form set forth in Exhibit F.

8.1.6  Owner shall review each such Request for Payment and may make such
exceptions as it deems necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.  Owner
shall not be required to make payment in respect of any portion of the Request
for Payment which Owner  reasonably believes has not been properly submitted in
accordance with this Agreement.  In no event shall Owner be required to make
payment for items reasonably disallowed by Owner pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.  Twenty-five (25) Days after receipt of a Request for Payment and
supporting documentation in the manner and detail and at the time herein
required, either Owner shall make payment to Contractor of undisputed amounts,
subject to Section 8.1.10 hereof, or Owner shall notify Contractor that it
disputes all or a portion of such Request for Payment.  Owner shall have a right
of set off against any undisputed amounts payable to Contractor.  The payment of
any Request for Payment by owner, including the Final Request for Payment (as
hereinafter defined), does not constitute approval or acceptance of any item of
cost in such Request for Payment.  If Owner improperly withholds any amount,
payment of such amount shall be made by Owner no later than ten (10) days after
determination that such amount was improperly withheld, together with interest
on such amount at the "prime rate" as described in the Wall Street Journal from
the date such payment should have been made.

8.1.7  Each payment made pursuant to this Article 8 shall be paid directly to
Contractor.  Such payment shall be wire-transferred to the following account for
the Contractor:

                                   U.S. Bank
                                ABA # 123103729

                             Account No. 5707802343

or such other account as may be designated in writing by Contractor.

8.1.8  Contractor agrees that seven and one-half percent (72%) of the Cost of
the Work shall be retained (the "Retainage") by owner retaining from the last
payment(s) an amount sufficient to equal seven and one-half percent (72%) of the
Cost of the Work payable to Contractor.  The Retainage will be held by Owner
until final payment ("Final Payment") is due from Owner to Contractor.

8.1.9  Within 25 days after the Final Completion Date and receipt by Owner of a
final Progress Report and a final request for payment ("Final Request for
Payment") which shall set forth all amounts due and remaining unpaid to
Contractor, and approval thereof by Owner, Owner shall pay to Contractor the
amount due under such Final Request for Payment.  Final Payment shall include
release of the remaining Retainage.  The Final Request for Payment shall not be
made until Contractor delivers to Owner a complete release of all liens arising
out of this Agreement and an affidavit that so far as Contractor has knowledge
or information the release includes and covers all portions of the Work for
which a lien could be filed, but Contractor may instead  furnish a bond
satisfactory to owner to indemnify owner against any lien.

8.1.10  Any provision hereof to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the
occurrence and continuance of any of the following events, Owner, upon notice to
Contractor, may withhold or retain such portion (including all) of any payment
due to Contractor under this Agreement as reasonably necessary to insure the
performance of the work or to protect fully Owner's rights hereunder:

         8.1.10.1 A default by Contractor has occurred and the grace period
         applicable thereto, if any, shall have expired;

         8.1.10.2 Contractor has failed to make prompt payments to its
         subcontractors for material or labor used in the Work for which Owner
         has made payment to Contractor and such failure is not the subject of a
         bona fide dispute;

         8.1.10.3 Any lien shall be filed against the Project, the Work or any
         portion thereof or any equipment or any materials encompassed therein
         for which the Contractor is responsible and such lien shall remain
         undischarged (and Contractor shall not have provided a bond); or

                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>
 
         8.1.10.4 Owner in good faith determines that Contractor cannot with
         prompt and reasonable acceleration of the Work meet the Substantial
         Completion Date.

8.1.11  Acceptance by Contractor of the Final Payment shall constitute a release
of Owner, its successors and assigns and every officer and agent thereof from
all liens (whether statutory or otherwise and including mechanics, or suppliers,
liens), claims and liability hereunder with respect to the Project or any Work
performed or furnished in connection with this Agreement, or for any act or
omission of Owner or of any person relating to or affecting this Agreement,
except for any claims which are (i) the subject of an action filed by Contractor
or (ii) the subject of a written request for resolution delivered by Contractor
prior to the Final Payment containing reasonable details regarding such dispute.
No payment by Owner shall be deemed a waiver by Owner of any obligation of
Contractor under this Agreement.

8.1.12  Contractor shall use the sums paid to it pursuant to this Article 8
solely for the purpose of the Project and performing the Work.  No provision
hereof shall be construed, however, to require or permit Owner to see to the
proper disposition or application of the monies so paid to Contractor.

8.1.13  It is understood and agreed by Contractor and Owner that any Request for
Payment which is nonconforming, incomplete or inaccurate or which lacks the
detail, specificity or supporting documentation required by this shall not, to
the extent of such deficiency, constitute a valid and proper Request for
Payment, and Owner shall not have any obligation to make payment of amounts in
respect of which such Request for Payment was deficient until Contractor shall
have resubmitted said Request for Payment, to the extent of such deficiency, in
proper form.

8.2  Contractor, for itself and other parties acting through or under it does
hereby agree with Owner that no mechanics, lien or other claim or encumbrance in
the nature of a lien shall be maintained against the Work or the Project or any
part or parts thereof or the appurtenances thereto, by Contractor or by any
subcontractor, for work done or for any tools, equipment, materials or
supervision or other services furnished under this Agreement for which Owner has
made payment to Contractor.

8.3  To the extent Contractor has received payment with respect to the Work or
the Project, Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless Owner and defend Owner
from any and all liens filed in connection therewith (other than liens filed due
to Owner's wrongful failure to make undisputed payments under this Agreement),
including all expenses and attorneys' fees incurred in discharging any liens or
similar encumbrances filed by Contractor or any of its subcontractors.  If
Contractor shall default in discharging any lien upon the Project, the Work or
any portion thereof, or any 

                                     - 23 -
<PAGE>
 
equipment or materials encompassed therein, Contractor shall promptly notify
Owner in writing and Contractor shall then satisfy or discharge any such lien(s)
(provided that Contractor shall have the right to submit a bond reasonably
satisfactory to Owner, in the amount required by law, if Contractor, despite its
reasonable efforts, has been unable to obtain discharge thereof). If Contractor
either does not promptly satisfy or commence reasonable efforts to discharge
such lien(s) (or, where permitted, fails to provide Owner with a bond in lieu
thereof), Owner shall have the right, at its option, after prior written
notification to Contractor, to pay or discharge such lien(s) and Contractor
shall, within ten (10) days of request by Owner, reimburse Owner for all
reasonable out of pocket costs actually incurred by Owner to discharge such
lien(s), including administrative costs, attorneys' fees and other expenses.

8.4  In order to give Owner and each of its successors and assigns full power
and authority to protect itself and the Project against any and all claims filed
by Contractor, or by any subcontractor or anyone acting under or through
Contractor in violation of the foregoing covenant, Contractor, for itself, its
successors and assigns, and all such persons, hereby covenants to  execute or
reexecute any agreement or instrument as Owner or its successors and assigns
shall reasonably request at no cost or expense to Owner or its successors and
assigns to evidence this waiver of liens and the agreements contained herein.

Owner.  The cost of the performance bond shall be reimbursed to Contractor by
Owner.

                    TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT AND OWNER'S
                   RIGHT TO PERFORM CONTRACTOR'S OBLIGATIONS

10.1      TERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTOR

10.1.1    If the Project is stopped for a period of thirty (30) days under an
order of any court or other public authority having jurisdiction, or as a result
of an act of government, such as a declaration of a national emergency making
materials unavailable, through no act or fault of the Contractor or if the
Project should be stopped for a period of thirty (30) days by the Contractor for
the Owner's failure to make payment thereon, then the Contractor may, upon seven
days' written notice to the Owner, terminate this Agreement and recover from the
Owner payment for all Work executed, the percentage fee due Contractor earned to
date, and for any proven loss sustained upon any materials, equipment, tools,
construction equipment and machinery.

10.1.1    If the Owner is adjudged a bankrupt, or if it makes a general
assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or if a receiver is appointed on

for all Work executed, the percentage fee due Contractor earned to date, and for
any proven loss sustained upon any materials, equipment, tools, construction
equipment and machinery.

10.2      OWNER'S RIGHT TO PERFORM CONTRACTOR'S OBLIGATIONS AND TERMINATION BY
          THE OWNER FOR CAUSE

10.2.1    If the Contractor fails to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement, including any obligation it assumes to perform Work with its own
forces, the Owner may, after seven days' written notice, during which period the

persistently or repeatedly refuses or fails, except in cases for which extension
of time is provided, to supply enough properly skilled workmen or proper
materials, or if it fails to make proper payment to subcontractors or for
materials or labor, or persistently disregards laws, ordinances, rules,
regulations or orders of any public authority having jurisdiction, or otherwise
is guilty of a substantial violation of a provision of this Agreement, then the
Owner may, without prejudice to any right or remedy and after giving the
Contractor and its surety, if any, seven (7) days' written notice, during which
period the Contractor fails to cure the violation, terminate the employment of
the Contractor and take possession of the Site and of all materials, equipment,
tools, construction equipment and machinery thereon owned by the Contractor and
may finish the Work by whatever reasonable method Owner may deem expedient. In
such case, the Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payment
until the Work is finished nor shall Contractor be relieved from its obligations
assumed under Article 6.

10.3      TERMINATION BY OWNER UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL OF CONTRACTOR

10.3.1    If, during the term of this Agreement, the ownership of Contractor
significantly changes (more than twenty percent of voting control or rights to
distribution upon liquidation, or any combination thereof),  Owner has the right
at its sole option to terminate this Agreement.  If the Owner terminates the
Agreement pursuant to this paragraph, Owner shall pay the Contractor the total

initial costs and preparatory expenses; (b) Costs incurred in settling and
paying termination claims under terminated subcontracts; (c) Accounting, legal,
clerical and other expenses incurred as a result of the termination; (d)

12.1  CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

12.1.1  Any information concerning the parties hereto which is designated in
writing as proprietary and disclosed to the other party incident to the
performance of Work pursuant to this Agreement is disclosed in confidence, and
the transferees shall not publish or otherwise disclose such information to
third parties without the prior written approval of the transferor; provided,
                                                                    -------- 
however, that nothing herein shall limit either party's right to disclose any
information provided by the other party hereunder which (i) was furnished by
such party prior to this Agreement without restrictions; (ii) was in the public
domain without fault or knowledge of the disclosing party prior to such
disclosure; or (iii) is received by either party from a third party without
restriction or breach of any duty of confidentiality and without breach of this
Agreement.  Contractor shall require any subcontractors, employees or
consultants performing any portion of the work under this Agreement also to
comply with this requirement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may
disclose any such information to the extent that such party is required by any
government authority to make such disclosure.  In addition, Owner may disclose
such information to the extent that such disclosure is required by any lender,
prospective lender, lender's consultant, purchaser of any output from the
Project, supplier of natural gas to the Project, and any person providing any
interconnection services to the project, provided that such persons agree to
reasonable confidentiality restrictions.

12.2  INVENTIONS AND LICENSES

12.2.1  Contractor agrees to disclose promptly to Owner all Inventions.  All
right, title and interest in and to such Inventions shall belong to Owner or its
designee.  Contractor agrees to execute or have executed all documents, and to
perform or have performed all lawful acts that Owner may deem desirable or
necessary to perfect its or its designee's title thereto and to obtain and
maintain patent coverage thereon at the expense of Owner.  Only for purposes of

irrevocable, royalty free, unrestricted, non-exclusive license with respect to
all Inventions.

12.2.2  For purposes of this Article 12.2, the term "Invention" means all
inventions which are based on or derived from proprietary information received
from Owner or first reduced to practice during the course of the Work by
Contractor and its employees or by any other subcontractors from whom Contractor
using reasonable efforts is able to obtain an agreement to assign such
inventions to Owner (but excluding inventions of such Persons not related to or
arising out of improvements to the K-Fuel Process).

the Work by the Owner or when institution of legal or equitable proceedings
based on such claim, dispute or other matter in question would be barred by the
applicable statute of limitations, whichever shall first occur.  The location of
the arbitration proceedings shall be Denver, Colorado, or such other location as
the parties may mutually agree.

contribution or indemnity asserted by one party to this Agreement against the
other party and arising out of any action brought in a state or federal court or

                                 MISCELLANEOUS


14.1  Further Assurances.  Each of Owner and Contractor will use its best
      ------------------                                                 
efforts to implement the provisions of this Agreement, and for such purpose
each, at the request of the other, will, without further consideration, promptly
execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to the other such
assistance, or assignments, consents or other instruments in addition to those
required by this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the other, as
the other may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to implement any provision
of this Agreement or to arrange financing of the Project.

14.2  Record Retention.  Contractor agrees to retain for a period of three (3)
      ----------------                                                        
years from the Final Completion Date all records relating to its performance of
the Work, and to cause all subcontractors engaged in connection with the Work
to retain for the same period all their records relating to the Work.  During
such period, Owner shall have access to such records at reasonable times after
reasonable notice to Contractor.  At the end of such period, Contractor will
offer such records to Owner.

14.3  No Waiver.  No waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
      ---------                                                                 
shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom such
waiver is sought to be enforced.  Any waiver of the terms hereof shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose given.  The
failure of a party to insist, in any instance, on the strict performance of any
of the terms and conditions hereof shall not be construed as a waiver of such
party's right in the future to insist on such strict performance.

14.4  Severability.  The invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of
      ------------

provision.
